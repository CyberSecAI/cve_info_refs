##### 3. Problem description:

a. VMware Tools Local Privilege Escalation on Windows-based guest OS

The VMware Tools Package provides support required for shared folders
(HGFS) and other features.

An input validation error is present in the Windows-based VMware
HGFS.sys driver. Exploitation of this flaw might result in
arbitrary code execution on the guest system by an unprivileged
guest user. It doesn't matter on what host the Windows guest OS
is running, as this is a guest driver vulnerability and not a
vulnerability on the host.

The HGFS.sys driver is present in the guest operating system if the
VMware Tools package is loaded. Even if the host has HGFS disabled
and has no shared folders, Windows-based guests may be affected. This
is regardless if a host supports HGFS.

This issue could be mitigated by removing the VMware Tools package
from Windows based guests. However this is not recommended as it
would impact usability of the product.

NOTE: Installing the new hosted release or ESX patches will not
remediate the issue. The VMware Tools packages will need
to be updated on each Windows-based guest followed by a
reboot of the guest system.

VMware would like to thank iDefense and Stephen Fewer of Harmony
Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5671 to this issue.

b. Privilege escalation on ESX or Linux based hosted operating systems

This update fixes a security issue related to local exploitation of
an untrusted library path vulnerability in vmware-authd. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and
the ability to execute the set-uid vmware-authd binary on an affected
system. Exploitation of this flaw might result in arbitrary code
execution on the Linux host system by an unprivileged user.

VMware would like to thank iDefense for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0967 to this issue.

c. Openwsman Invalid Content-Length Vulnerability

Openwsman is a system management platform that implements the Web
Services Management protocol (WS-Management). It is installed and
running by default. It is used in the VMware Management Service
Console and in ESXi.

The openwsman management service on ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 is vulnerable
to a privilege escalation vulnerability, which may allow users with
non-privileged ESX or Virtual Center accounts to gain root privileges.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need a local ESX
account or a VirtualCenter account with the Host.Cim.CimInteraction
permission.

Systems with no local ESX accounts and no VirtualCenter accounts with
the Host.Cim.CimInteraction permission are not vulnerable.

This vulnerability cannot be exploited by users without valid login
credentials.

Discovery: Alexander Sotirov, VMware Security Research

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2097 to this issue.

d. VMware VIX Application Programming Interface (API) Memory Overflow
Vulnerabilities

The VIX API (also known as "Vix") is an API that lets users write scripts
and programs to manipulate virtual machines.

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present in the VIX API.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might result in a privilege
escalation on the host system. This exploit scenario is relevant for all
affected products. On VC, ESX30x, and ESX35, users need to have the VM
Interaction Privilege in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might also result in code execution on
the host system from the guest system or on the service console in ESX Server
from the guest operating system. This exploit scenario is relevant for
Workstation 6.0.x (version 6.0.3 and below), Player 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and
below), ACE 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and below), Server 1.0.x (version 1.0.5 and
below), and ESX3.5. The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" in the VMware
configuration file must be set to true to allow for exploitation on these
products. Note that the parameter "vix-inGuest.enable" is set to false by
default.

The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" is present in the
following products:

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and higher
VMware ACE 6.0.2 and higher
VMware Server 1.06 and higher
VMware Fusion 1.1.2 and higher
ESX Server 3.0 and higher
ESX Server 3.5 and higher

In previous versions of VMware products where the VIX API was introduced,
the VIX API couldn't be disabled.

This vulnerability is present in ESX and the hosted products even if you
have not installed the VIX API. To patch your system you will need to
update to the new hosted product version or to apply the appropriate ESX
patch. It is not necessary to update the VIX API if you have installed
the VIX API.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of
Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2100 to this issue.

##### II Service Console rpm updates

NOTE: ESXi and hosted products are not affected by any service console security updates

##### a. Security update for cyrus-sasl

Updated cyrus-sasl package for the ESX Service Console corrects a security
issue found in the DIGEST-MD5 authentication mechanism of Cyrus'
implementation of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL). As a
result of this issue in the authentication mechanism, a remote
unauthenticated attacker might be able to cause a denial of service error
on the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2006-1721 to this issue.

RPMs Updated:

##### b. Security update for tcltk

An input validation flaw was discovered in Tk's GIF image handling. A
code-size value read from a GIF image was not properly validated before
being used, leading to a buffer overflow. A specially crafted GIF file
could use this to cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the
privileges of the application using the Tk graphical toolkit.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2008-0553 to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Tk's animated GIF image handling.
An animated GIF containing an initial image smaller than subsequent images
could cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the privileges of
the application using the Tk library.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2007-5378 to this issue.

A flaw first discovered in the Tcl regular expression engine used in the
PostgreSQL database server, resulted in an infinite loop when processing
certain regular expressions.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2007-4772 to this issue.

##### c. Security update for unzip

This patch includes a moderate security update to the service console that
fixes a flaw in unzip. An attacker could execute malicious code with a
user's privileges if the user ran unzip on a file designed to leverage
this flaw.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2008-0888 to this issue.

##### d. Security update for krb5

KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not set a global variable
for some krb4 message types, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via crafted messages that trigger a NULL pointer dereference
or double-free.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0062 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

The Kerberos 4 support in KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not
properly clear the unused portion of a buffer when generating an
error message, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information, aka "Uninitialized stack values."

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0063 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc\_dtablesize.c) used
by libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably
other versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h
does not define the FD\_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
triggering a large number of open file descriptors.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0948 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## MIT Kerberos contains array overrun in RPC library used by kadmind

#### Vulnerability Note VU#374121

Original Release Date: 2008-03-18 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

Vulnerabilities in the MIT Kerberos libgssrpc library may allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The MIT krb5 Kerberos implementation includes a GSS RPC library used in the Kerberos administration server (kadmind). Two flaws exist in the libgssprc library that can cause an array overrun if too many file descriptors are opened. These flaws result in a vulnerability that could allow memory corruption in the kadmind server.  MIT notes that in software versions 1.4 and later, this flaw can only be exploited in configurations that allow large numbers of open file descriptors in a process. In software versions before 1.3, a similar flaw can be exploited in similar circumstances but is further limited to platforms that do not define certain macros in certain C system header files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the libgssrpc library used by kadmind. kadmind will crash, thereby resulting in a denial of service. MIT notes that it is at least theoretically possible for such corruption to result in database corruption or arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch from the vendor**Patches have been released to address these issues. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workaround**Before starting kadmind, use "ulimit -n" for Bourne shell and derivatives or "limit descriptors" for C shell and derivatives. Or use similar resource-limiting mechanisms in the invoking process to limit the maximum open file descriptors. The chosen limit should be less than or equal to the value of the FD\_SETSIZE macro typically defined in the <sys/select.h> header file. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The krb5 package is the implementation of the Kerberos protocol suite
from MIT.
This update fixes three vulnerabilities, two of them are only possible if
krb4 support is enabled:
- CVE-2008-0062: null/dangling pointer (krb4)
- CVE-2008-0063: operations on uninitialized buffer content,
possible information leak (krb4)
- CVE-2008-0947/8: out-of-bound array
access in kadmind's RPC lib
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the new packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the kerberos services.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MITKRB5-SA-2008-002
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2008-002
Original release: 2008-03-18
Last update: 2008-03-18
Topic: array overrun in RPC library used by kadmind
CVE-2008-0947, CVE-2008-0948
VU#374121
Use of high-numbered file descriptors in the RPC library, used by
kadmind, can cause references past the end of an array.
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:P/RL:T/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 10
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 7.8
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SUMMARY
=======
Two bugs in the RPC library server code, used in the kadmin server,
causes an array overrun if too many file descriptors are opened.
Memory corruption can result.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause memory corruption in the
kadmind process, which is likely to cause kadmind to crash, resulting
in a denial of service. It is at least theoretically possible for
such corruption to result in database corruption or arbitrary code
execution, though we have no such exploit and are not aware of any
such exploits in use in the wild.
CVE-2008-0947: In 1.4 and later, this bug can only be triggered in
configurations that allow large numbers of open file descriptors in a
process.
CVE-2008-0948: In versions before 1.3, this bug can be triggered in
similar circumstances, but is further limited to platforms not
defining certain macros in certain C system header files. Solaris 10
and Mac OS X 10.4 appear to be unaffected, while GNU libc systems
(e.g., many GNU/Linux distributions) are. It appears that in at least
some cases kadmind will simply exit after getting a "bad file
descriptor" error, but this cannot be guaranteed.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
CVE-2008-0947: libgssrpc and kadmind, from krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.3
CVE-2008-0948: libgssrpc and kadmind, in krb5-1.2.2 and probably most
other versions before 1.3, on systems where  does not define
FD\_SETSIZE.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: Check the system header files for the value of
FD\_SETSIZE. Use "ulimit -n" or "limit descriptors" in the shell
invoking kadmind to limit the number of open file descriptors to
FD\_SETSIZE or less, before starting kadmind. Then the operating
system will prevent the use of file descriptors large enough to
exploit this bug.
\* Apply the following patch for krb5-1.4 and later:

This patch will result in too-high-numbered file descriptors being
immediately closed after the connection comes in. Clients will see
connections established, and then closed; a "GSS-API (or Kerberos)
error while initializing kadmin interface" will eventually result.
Once some of the lower-numbered file descriptors are closed, clients
will be able to get useful connections again.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to Jeff Altman of Secure Endpoints for discovering and
reporting this problem in 1.6.3.
Thanks to the Red Hat Security Response Team for noting that 1.2.2 was
also affected by the same problem, for different reasons.

please PGP-encrypt it using the following key:

sub 2048g/3A91A276 2008-01-18 [expires: 2009-02-01]
DETAILS
=======
The variable svc\_maxfd tracks the highest-numbered file descriptor
registered with the RPC library as a transport handle. While the
registration function does check that the file descriptor number is
less than FD\_SETSIZE for array references, the code for updating
svc\_maxfd is not so protected. Elsewhere, svc\_maxfd is used as an
upper bound for array indexing, and as the maximum file descriptor
number to pass to select().
In 1.2.2, the variable is called max\_xport, and is checked against the
value returned by \_gssrpc\_rpc\_dtablesize(), but while that function
checks FD\_SETSIZE if it's defined, the source file containing it only
includes unistd.h, which doesn't define FD\_SETSIZE on all platforms.
In kadmind, the value from \_gssrpc\_rpc\_dtablesize() is also passed to
select() as the maximum file descriptor number.
