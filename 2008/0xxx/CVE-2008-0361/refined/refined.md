Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0361

**Vulnerable Software:** Gradman <= 0.1.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `agregar_info.php` script is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to insufficient input validation of the `tabla` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `tabla` parameter in the `agregar_info.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data like configuration files, application source code, or user data. The provided exploit attempts to read `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to `agregar_info.php`, supplying a manipulated `tabla` parameter with directory traversal sequences (`../`) and null byte termination (`%00`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script is located at `agregar_info.php`

**Technical Details:**
The exploit code provided uses Perl and LWP::UserAgent to craft an HTTP GET request, including directory traversal sequences and a null byte terminator in the `tabla` parameter:
```perl
$iny="agregar_info.php?tabla=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00";
```
The script then checks if the response body contains the string "root", indicating successful exploitation.
