Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-0428:

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `login` function in `system/class_permissions.php` directly incorporates user-supplied input (`username` and `password`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **File Disclosure:** The `file.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input (`file` parameter) into a file path without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of input validation and sanitization in the login mechanism allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **File Disclosure:** Insufficient sanitization of the file parameter allows for directory traversal and arbitrary file access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can access arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive source code or configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted POST request with a malicious username, such as `admin' or 1=1 /*` and any password. This is successful when magic quotes are disabled.
*  **File Disclosure:** Sending a crafted GET request to `file.php` with a file parameter that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../system/class_mysql.php`). A valid referrer header must be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **File Disclosure:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and specify a valid `Referer` header.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Bloofox CMS version 0.3 and possibly prior versions.
*   The exploit can be done remotely using a web browser.
*   No fix was available at the time of the report.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability is dependent on magic quotes being disabled on the server.
*  The file disclosure vulnerability has a check for referrer, meaning that the attacker has to supply a valid referrer header for the exploit to work, for example `Referer: http://servername/`.
