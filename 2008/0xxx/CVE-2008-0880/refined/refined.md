Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `page_id` parameter within the `EasyContent` module of PHP-Nuke. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `page_id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the database.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database. As shown in the example, this includes usernames and password hashes from the `nuke_authors` table.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By extracting the username/password of an admin user (where `radminsuper=1`), the attacker could gain full administrative access to the PHP-Nuke site, as demonstrated in the provided exploit examples.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker could potentially modify or delete data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script `modules.php` with the `EasyContent` module loaded, using a malicious `page_id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke application to send the crafted HTTP requests.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious queries.

**Exploit example:**
```
modules.php?op=modload&name=EasyContent&file=index&menu=410&page_id=-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,aid/**/from/**/nuke_authors/**/where/**/radminsuper=1/*
modules.php?op=modload&name=EasyContent&file=index&menu=410&page_id=-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,pwd/**/from/**/nuke_authors/**/where/**/radminsuper=1/*
```
These examples inject a SQL query to retrieve admin usernames (`aid`) and password hashes (`pwd`) from the `nuke_authors` table.
