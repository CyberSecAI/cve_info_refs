      "description": "OZJournals 2.1.1 suffers from a local file disclosure vulnerability. The application uses .php files as storage and reads post data using the `file_get_contents` function. While this approach prevents traditional LFI exploits, the print functionality, which uses an 'id' parameter, allows an attacker to retrieve the content of arbitrary files. The application uses explode() with \"\\t\" after reading the file, which may disclose sensitive data in config files that may use tabs. This vulnerability is considered very low risk but allows for reconnaissance such as fishing out database credentials.",
      "root_cause": "The application uses the 'id' parameter in the print functionality with the `file_get_contents` function without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary file disclosure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Disclosure",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Disclosure of arbitrary files, potentially revealing sensitive data like database credentials in configuration files.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'id' parameter"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required."
