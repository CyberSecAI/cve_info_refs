Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0498

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `main_bigware_53.tpl.php` file of Bigware Shop 2.0. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `pollid` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*  **Direct use of $_GET:** The code directly uses user-supplied input from the $_GET array in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. In the provided proof-of-concept, an attacker can retrieve the admin's email address and password hash.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection could lead to further malicious activities, such as data manipulation, privilege escalation (if the database user has those privileges), or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `pollid` GET parameter in a request to the `main_bigware_53.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication is needed to perform the attack.
* The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query as a value for the `pollid` parameter.

**Technical Details (from Exploit-DB):**
The vulnerable code snippet from `main_bigware_53.tpl.php` is:

```php
if (!isset($_GET['op'])) {
    $_GET['op']="list";
    }
switch ($_GET['op']) {
    case "results":
        if (isset($_GET['pollid'])) {
            $pollid=$_GET['pollid'];
        } else {
        $pollid=1;
        }
              $poll_query = go_db_query("SELECT pollid, timeStamp FROM phesis_poll_desc WHERE pollid='".$pollid."'");
              $polls = go_db_fetch_array($poll_query);
                      $title_query = go_db_query("select optionText from phesis_poll_data where pollid=$pollid and voteid='0' and language_id = '" . $languages_id . "'");
                      $title = go_db_fetch_array($title_query);
```
The proof-of-concept exploit is provided as:

```
main_bigware_53.php?op=results&pollid=-1/**/and/**/voteid=0/**/and/**/language_id=5/**/and/**/1=1/**/UnIOn/**/SeLeCt/**/ConCat(former_email_address,0x3a,former_password)/**/FrOM/**/former/**/WhEre/**/former_id=1/*
```

The attacker injects a malicious SQL payload that bypasses the original query and selects the email address and password from the `former` table.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit code notes that the password hash is "salted" but "cracking this hash is very easy".
* The exploit author mentioned that more vulnerabilities were present in the source code, including Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
*   The provided content from exploit-db provides more details than a typical CVE description.

Based on the analysis, the provided content is relevant to CVE-2008-0498 and provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
