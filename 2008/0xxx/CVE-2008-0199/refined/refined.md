Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in PRO-search:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities stem from improper handling of user-supplied input in the PRO-search application, specifically in the parameters used for filtering and displaying search results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple parameters on the main page are vulnerable to XSS attacks. These parameters include `prot`, `host`, `path`, `name`, `ext`, `size`, `search_days`, and `show_page`. The vulnerability exists because the application does not sanitize or properly encode user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `show_page` parameter is vulnerable to a DoS attack. When set to a large value (e.g., 20000), the application attempts to search through all files, causing a significant delay and potentially making the service unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **XSS:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Other malicious actions that can be performed in the user's browser context.
2.  **DoS:** Successful exploitation can make the PRO-search service temporarily unavailable, which would disrupt legitimate users trying to use it. The DoS is described as short-lived, requiring repeated requests to maintain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts by crafting URLs with the vulnerable parameters. These URLs can be distributed through various means such as emails, social media, or links on other websites.
*   **DoS:** Attackers can trigger the denial of service by sending HTTP requests to the web server with a large value for the `show_page` parameter. This can be done through a script, making repeated requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers do not need any special access or authentication to execute the XSS attack. They can craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript and trick victims into clicking that URL.
*   **DoS:**  Attackers can perform the DoS attack from any location that can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered in August 2007 and publicly disclosed on December 24, 2007.
*   The identified vulnerabilities affect PRO-search versions 0.17.x and all earlier versions.
*   The DoS attack is described as short-term and requires continuous requests to maintain the effect.
