Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `explorerdir.php` script. The script directly uses user-supplied input (the `name` parameter) to construct file paths without adequate checks, leading to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse directories on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files, source code, and potentially other sensitive data.
- Depending on the server's configuration and permissions, this could also lead to further compromise of the system or other applications running on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests to the `explorerdir.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `name` parameter.
- Attackers can use relative path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- They need to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the `explorerdir.php` script with a manipulated `name` parameter.
- No special privileges or authentication is required for exploitation.
