Response:

Root cause of vulnerability:
- An integer overflow error exists within the "cli_scanpe()" function in libclamav/pe.c.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Integer overflow in cli_scanpe() in libclamav/pe.c
- Heap memory corruption in unmew11() function in libclamav/mew.c

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Arbitrary code execution, potentially with the privileges of the user running ClamAV.

Attack vectors:
- A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a specially crafted file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to craft a malicious file that triggers the integer overflow in `cli_scanpe()` or the heap corruption in `unmew11()`.
- Ability to get the vulnerable system to scan the crafted file.
