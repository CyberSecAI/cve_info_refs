{
  "CVE-2008-0216": {
    "root_cause": "The `ptsname(3)` function incorrectly extracts two characters from a device node name in `/dev` without verifying it's a valid pty owned by the calling user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input validation",
      "Improper privilege management"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user with read access to a device node with a name that matches the format of a pty can gain access to the content of a pty belonging to another user. This can lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local malicious user with read access to a specially crafted device node.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs read access to a device node with a name resembling a pty, and be able to open multiple tty's to increase the probability to obtain the pty name of a 'vulnerable' pty."
