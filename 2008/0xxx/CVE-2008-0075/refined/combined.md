# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-006 - Important

## Vulnerability in Internet Information Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution (942830)

Published: February 12, 2008 | Updated: February 20, 2008

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This important update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS). A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that IIS handles input to ASP Web pages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI). The WPI is configured with Network Service account privileges by default. IIS servers with ASP pages whose application pools are configured with a WPI that uses an account with administrative privileges could be more seriously impacted than IIS servers whose application pool is configured with the default WPI settings.

The security update is rated important for Microsoft Internet Information Services on all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, **Vulnerability Information.**

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** None

## ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0075

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Information Services handles input to ASP Web pages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by passing malicious input to a Web siteâs ASP page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform any actions on the IIS Server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI), which by default is configured with Network Service account privileges.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0075](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0075).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0075

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* IIS 5.1 is not part of a default install of Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2.
* On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, IIS is not installed or enabled by default.
* On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, if IIS is enabled, classic ASP is not installed or enabled by default.
* On supported editions of Windows Server 2003, if IIS is enabled and classic ASP is used, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could only obtain Network Service account privileges by default. By default, Network Service account privileges have the same user rights as an authenticated user.
* ASP.NET is not affected by this vulnerability. Customers who have only ASP.NET installed and not ASP are not at risk from this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0075

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **On Windows Server 2003, disable classic ASP**

  To disable classic ASP, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
  2. Click the **plus sign** (+) next to the serverâs name and then click the **Web Service Extensions** folder.
  3. Click to highlight **Active Server Pages** in the right pane and then click **Prohibit.**

  \*\*Impact of workaround.\*\*Users will be unable to use classic ASP pages.

  \*\*How to undo the workaround.\*\*To undo the workaround, follow steps 1 through 3 above and click **Allow** when highlighting **Active Server Pages**.

#### FAQ for ASP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0075

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI), which by default is configured with Network Service account privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that Internet Information Services incorrectly processes input to ASP pages.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS Server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI), which is configured with Network Service account privileges by default. Services configured with Network Service account privileges obtain authenticated user level access, not administrative level access. For more information see [NetworkService Account](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms684272%28vs.85%29.aspx). IIS servers whose application pool is configured with a WPI that uses an account with administrative privileges could be more seriously impacted than IIS servers whose application pool is configured with the default WPI settings.

The Network Service account uses the computer's credentials when it authenticates remotely, but has a greatly reduced privilege level on the server itself and, therefore, does not have local administrator privileges. For more information see [NetworkService Account](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms684272%28vs.85%29.aspx), [IIS and Built-in Accounts (IIS 6.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/3648346f-e4f5-474b-86c7-5a86e85fa1ff.mspx), [Configuring Worker Process Identities (IIS 6.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/76be66e2-1db1-432e-95be-14ff59c2ec75.mspx), and [Configuring Application Pools in IIS 6.0 (IIS 6.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/2a231dcb-d786-4b6d-b3ba-bda04061a5e7.mspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could pass specially crafted input to an ASP page. The ASP page could already exist or could be uploaded by a user in a hosted environment.

**What are worker processes for IIS?**

Worker processes are processes that execute the server-side processing tasks for a web server\*\*.\*\* For information on worker processes and how they are implemented in IIS 6.0 see [Worker Processes (IIS 6.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/29f53968-0115-451f-b26d-5ad58d87b5d1.mspx). Additional information on worker processes and how they execute Web-based applications in isolation see [Worker Process Isolation Mode (IIS 6.0)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/iis/333f3410-b566-49bc-8399-57bcc404db8c.mspx).

**What is ASP?**

Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) is a server-side scripting technology that can be used to create dynamic and interactive Web applications. An ASP page is an HTML page that contains server-side scripts that are processed by the Web server before being sent to the user's browser.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional Web servers are at risk if IIS and ASP are enabled. Web hosting providers that allow their customers to upload ASP pages to their hosted Web sites are at increased risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by changing the way that Internet Information Services processes input to ASP pages.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
