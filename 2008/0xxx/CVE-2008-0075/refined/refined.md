{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that Internet Information Services incorrectly processes input to ASP pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Information Services handles input to ASP Web pages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could then perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI). The WPI is configured with Network Service account privileges by default. IIS servers with ASP pages whose application pools are configured with a WPI that uses an account with administrative privileges could be more seriously impacted than IIS servers whose application pool is configured with the default WPI settings.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by passing malicious input to a Web siteâ€™s ASP page. The ASP page could already exist or could be uploaded by a user in a hosted environment.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to a vulnerable server hosting an ASP page."
