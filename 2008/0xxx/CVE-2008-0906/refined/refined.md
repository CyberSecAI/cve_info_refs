```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'artid' parameter when constructing SQL queries.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application and its underlying database. In this specific exploit, the attacker is attempting to retrieve user credentials from the database.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `modules.php` script, specifically targeting the `name=Docum` module with the `op=viewarticle` action and a malicious `artid` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
