## KAME project IPv6 IPComp header denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#110947

Original Release Date: 2008-02-06 | Last Revised: 2009-04-29

---

### Overview

The KAME project's IPv6 implementation does not properly process IPv6 packets that contain the IPComp header. If exploited, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to cause a vulnerable system to crash.

### Description

| Per RFC [3173](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3173.txt):  *IP payload compression is a protocol to reduce the size of IP datagrams. This protocol will increase the overall communication performance between a pair of communicating hosts/gateways ("nodes") by compressing the datagrams, provided the nodes have sufficient computation power, through either CPU capacity or a compression coprocessor, and the communication is over slow or congested links.*Systems that have IPv6 networking derived from the [KAME project](http://www.kame.net/) IPv6 implementationmay not properly process IPv6 packets that contain an IPComp header. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an IPv6 packet with a IPComp header to a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a vulnerable system to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| See the systems affected section of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. Administrators who compile their kernel from source should see <http://www.kame.net/dev/cvsweb2.cgi/kame/kame/sys/netinet6/ipcomp_input.c.diff?r1=1.36;r2=1.37> for more information. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Until updates can be applied, using a packet-filtering firewall to block IPv6 packets that contain the IPComp header may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by remote attackers. |

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:04.ipsec Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: IPsec null pointer dereference panic
Category: core
Module: ipsec
Announced: 2008-02-14
Credits: Takashi Sogabe, Tatuya Jinmei
Affects: FreeBSD 5.5
Corrected: 2008-02-14 11:49:39 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2008-02-14 11:50:28 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p19)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-0177
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The IPsec suite of protocols provide network level security for IPv4
and IPv6 packets. FreeBSD includes software originally developed by
the KAME project which implements the various protocols that make up
IPsec.
II. Problem Description
There is an improper reference to a data structure in the processing of
IPsec packets, which can result in a NULL pointer being dereferenced.
III. Impact
A single specifically crafted IPv6 packet could cause the kernel to panic,
when the kernel had been configured to process IPsec and IPv6 traffic.
This requires IPSEC to be compiled into the kernel, it does not necessarily
have to be configured at that point.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but kernels which does not include IPsec
support are not vulnerable. The GENERIC and SMP kernel configurations
distributed with FreeBSD releases do not include IPsec support.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or to the RELENG\_5\_5
security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:04/ipsec.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:04/ipsec.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
