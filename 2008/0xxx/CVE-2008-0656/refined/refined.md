Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the ability to specify an arbitrary filename attribute to the `dmclTrace.jsp` page within Documentum Administrator and Documentum Webtop applications. This allows for arbitrary file overwriting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core weakness is the ability to overwrite any file on the server's filesystem due to insufficient validation of the filename provided in the `dmclTrace.jsp` parameter.
- **Uncontrolled File Content:** Attackers can control the content of the overwritten file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting server-side files with malicious code, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application server's user.
- **Complete Compromise:** The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "High" with a CVSS base score of 10/10, suggesting a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely via HTTP requests.
- The specific attack vector is leveraging the `dmclTrace.jsp` page by manipulating the filename attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable Documentum server.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Software:**
    - Documentum Administrator version 5.3.0.313
    - Documentum Webtop version 5.3.0.317
