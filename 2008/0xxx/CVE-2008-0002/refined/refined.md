{
  "CVE-2008-0002": {
    "Description": "If an exception occurs during the processing of parameters (eg if the client disconnects) then it is possible that the parameters submitted for that request will be incorrectly processed as part of a subsequent request.",
    "Root cause": "A failure to properly isolate parameters from different requests when an exception occurs during parameter processing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of exceptions during parameter processing",
      "Lack of isolation between request parameters"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure: parameters from one request can be incorrectly processed as part of a subsequent request, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "A client causes an exception during parameter processing, potentially by disconnecting. This can be done remotely.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server and cause an exception during the parameter processing stage. This can be done remotely."
