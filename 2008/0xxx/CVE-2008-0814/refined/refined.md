```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `download.php` script in TRUC 0.11.0 is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is a file disclosure vulnerability through directory traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files or system files, leading to information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted request to `download.php` with the `upload_filename` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../).
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication. They only need to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
