Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$id` variable within the `com_comments` component of Mambo. This allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is a **SQL Injection vulnerability**. The code directly incorporates the unsanitized `$id` variable into a SQL query:
    ```php
    $pt_query = "SELECT * FROM mos_content_comments where articleid=$id AND published=1 order by id DESC";
    ```
    This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `$id` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker could use this vulnerability to extract sensitive data, specifically usernames and passwords, from the `mos_users` table. The impact could include:
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to user credentials and other sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Complete system compromise: If the database user has write privileges, the attacker could modify or delete data, or potentially escalate to more significant control over the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file of Mambo. The vulnerable parameter is `id` within the `com_comments` component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mambo application. This implies a remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability.
    *   Knowledge of the vulnerable component and the URL structure is required. The exploit provides the vulnerable URL and SQL injection payload.

In summary, this entry details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_comments` component of Mambo versions 0.5.8.5g and earlier, allowing attackers to extract sensitive data via manipulating the `id` parameter.
