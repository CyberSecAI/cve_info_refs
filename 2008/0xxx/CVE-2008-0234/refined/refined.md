# CVE-2008-0234

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Apple QuickTime Player when handling Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) response messages. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when QuickTime attempts to display the "Reason-Phrase" associated with certain RTSP status codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow that occurs in the "LCD-like screen" area where QuickTime displays status information. This buffer is overflowed when a specially crafted, overly long "Reason-Phrase" is received.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the QuickTime player.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system by overwriting return addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RTSP Stream:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user connects to a malicious RTSP stream. This can be achieved by luring users to click a specially crafted `rtsp://` link.
- **HTTP fallback:** If the default RTSP port (554) is closed, QuickTime may fall back to HTTP on port 80. A specially crafted HTTP response message (e.g. a 404 error with a long Reason-Phrase)  can also trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web Page Content:** An attacker can embed malicious RTSP links within web pages using QuickTime Media Link files, which, if clicked by a user, can load the malicious RTSP stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication.
- **Malicious RTSP Server/Response:** The attacker needs the capability to host a malicious RTSP server or deliver a crafted HTTP response to the victim.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into accessing the malicious RTSP stream or crafted HTTP response. This could be achieved by convincing the user to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted RTSP response, particularly when the `Reason-Phrase` is longer than expected.
- The overflow occurs during the rendering/displaying process in the status area of QuickTime player.

**Affected Platforms:**
-  Microsoft Windows
-  Apple Mac OS X

**Affected Software:**
- QuickTime Player versions <= 7.3.1.70
- Apple iTunes (because it includes QuickTime)
