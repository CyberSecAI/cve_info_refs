{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the 'Client-IP' HTTP header before it is used in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication, access sensitive data (like usernames and passwords), and potentially take control of the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP request that injects malicious SQL code via the 'Client-IP' header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker doesn't require any specific privileges on the system."
