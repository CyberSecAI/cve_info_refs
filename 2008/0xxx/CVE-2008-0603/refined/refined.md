- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mambo component 'com_awesom' version 0.3.2 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `listid` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table).
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `listid` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
