Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in the `capp-lspp-config` script used during Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL5) installations, specifically those using the CAPP/LSPP configuration.
*   The script copies file permissions when installing evaluation-specific configurations. It uses the `stat` command to retrieve the original file's permissions, however, it does not dereference symlinks by default.
*   In RHEL5, `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` is a symlink to `/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac`. The `stat` command, without the `-L` flag, operates on the symlink itself and not the target file. As a result it obtains incorrect permissions.
*   Because the symlink had default permissions, the script incorrectly set the permissions of `/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac` to world-writable (777).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is that `/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac` was incorrectly made world-writable (777) by the configuration script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass/Weakening:** Unauthorized changes to the `/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac` file can disable or weaken the system's authentication methods, potentially including remote access.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Authorized users with limited privileges could exploit this to gain additional access. It could also be an escalation method for other vulnerabilities in low-privilege services.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability has the potential for serious impact because if PAM settings are altered, system security and access can be completely compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker could be a local user with limited privileges that escalates privileges by changing the file.
*   **Supply Chain:** A malicious actor could compromise the vulnerable RPM containing the script.
*   **Automated Installation:** Kickstart installations which run the script are vulnerable by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have a local shell on the affected system to modify the world-writable file.
*   **Privilege:** A low-privileged user is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `authconfig` RPM introduced the symlink during RHEL5 development to support local PAM configuration changes more easily.
*   The issue was fixed by adding the `-L` flag to the `stat` command within the configuration script to ensure it dereferences symlinks.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by MLS SELinux policy in LSPP mode, but targeted policy in CAPP mode does allow write access for normal users.
*   The vulnerability only occurs if the `capp-lspp-config` script is run, typically as part of a kickstart-based installation. Just installing the RPM is not enough to trigger the issue.
*   The fix was released as RHSA-2008:0193.
