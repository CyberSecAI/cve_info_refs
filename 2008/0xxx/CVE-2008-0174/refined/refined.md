*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker may use man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept and modify network traffic to obtain the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the Proficy Information Portal server.
*   **Monitoring Tools:** Ability to perform network monitoring.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects GE Fanuc Proficy Information Portal up to and including version 2.6.
*   Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.
