{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter within various PHP files of the ChronoForms component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes a remote file specified via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing attackers to completely compromise the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter pointing to a remote file controlled by the attacker.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication or access to the server is needed."
