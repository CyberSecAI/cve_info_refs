Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0102:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Office Publisher's incorrect validation of application data when loading Publisher files into memory. Specifically, when parsing a specially crafted Publisher file, the application does not properly validate the memory references within, which leads to an exploitable condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Reference:** The core issue is an invalid memory reference that occurs when a specially crafted .pub file is loaded. This is triggered by a failure to properly validate application data before loading it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Complete System Control:**  An attacker gains full control of the compromised system, with the same rights as the user. This enables the attacker to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Publisher file as an email attachment, and if the user opens the file, the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a website that contains a malicious .pub file. The attacker then would need to entice the user to visit the website and open the malicious file, often by tricking users into clicking a link in a message. Web sites that accept user-provided content, or compromised web sites could also host this malicious content.
*   **File Sharing/Storage:** Malicious files could be placed on network shares, USB drives, or other storage media, and if opened by a user, exploitation will occur.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specifically crafted .pub file that exploits the invalid memory reference.
*   **Social Engineering:** For email and web-based attacks, the attacker must be able to convince the victim to open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that hosts the malicious .pub file.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open the malicious Publisher file for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Office Publisher 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3 and 2003 SP2.
*   Microsoft Office Publisher 2003 SP3, 2007, and 2007 SP1 are not affected.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the update immediately to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed when the bulletin was released.
*   Microsoft did not receive reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time the bulletin was released.

The information provided is consistent with the official description of CVE-2008-0102 and also provides greater detail about the attack vectors, required attacker capabilities and impact of the vulnerability.
