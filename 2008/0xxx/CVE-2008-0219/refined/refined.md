```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id_actividad` parameter within the `soporte_horizontal_w.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "SQL injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially retrieve sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses from the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `soporte_horizontal_w.php`, manipulating the `id_actividad` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or prior access is required, meaning it can be performed remotely."
