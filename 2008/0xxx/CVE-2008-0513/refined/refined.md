{
  "CVE-2008-0513": {
    "Description": "phpCMS system has remote File Disclosure vulnerability in page /parser/include/class.cache_phpcms.php",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check for null byte injection in the `GetFile()` function within `class.cache_phpcms.php`. This allows an attacker to bypass file extension checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing null byte check",
      "Unrestricted file access"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read any file within the web directory, including sensitive files like configuration files that contain database passwords or other credentials. In Windows, arbitrary files outside of the web directory can also be accessed.",
    "Attack vectors": "By appending a null byte followed by a valid file extension (e.g. '%00.gif') to the requested file path through the 'file' parameter in the `/parser/parser.php` script.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
