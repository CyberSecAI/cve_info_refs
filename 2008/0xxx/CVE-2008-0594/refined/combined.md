## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser and JavaScript engine.

By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker

could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2008-0412](/security/CVE-2008-0412), [CVE-2008-0413](/security/CVE-2008-0413))

Flaws were discovered in the file upload form control. A malicious

website could force arbitrary files from the user's computer to be

uploaded without consent. ([CVE-2008-0414](/security/CVE-2008-0414))

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could escalate

privileges within the browser, perform cross-site scripting attacks

and/or execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-0415](/security/CVE-2008-0415))

Various flaws were discovered in character encoding handling. If a

user were ticked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker

could perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-0416](/security/CVE-2008-0416))

Justin Dolske discovered a flaw in the password saving mechanism. By

tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

corrupt the user's stored passwords. ([CVE-2008-0417](/security/CVE-2008-0417))

Gerry Eisenhaur discovered that the chrome URI scheme did not properly

guard against directory traversal. Under certain circumstances, an

attacker may be able to load files or steal session data. Ubuntu is

not vulnerable in the default installation. ([CVE-2008-0418](/security/CVE-2008-0418))

David Bloom discovered flaws in the way images are treated by the

browser. A malicious website could exploit this to steal the user's

history information, crash the browser and/or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2008-0419](/security/CVE-2008-0419))

Flaws were discovered in the BMP decoder. By tricking a user into

opening a specially crafted BMP file, an attacker could obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-0420](/security/CVE-2008-0420))

Michal Zalewski discovered flaws with timer-enabled security dialogs.

A malicious website could force the user to confirm a security dialog

without explicit consent. ([CVE-2008-0591](/security/CVE-2008-0591))

It was discovered that Firefox mishandled locally saved plain text

files. By tricking a user into saving a specially crafted text file,

an attacker could prevent the browser from displaying local files

with a .txt extension. ([CVE-2008-0592](/security/CVE-2008-0592))

Martin Straka discovered flaws in stylesheet handling after a 302

redirect. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an

attacker could obtain sensitive URL parameters. ([CVE-2008-0593](/security/CVE-2008-0593))

Emil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that a web forgery

warning dialog wasn't displayed under certain circumstances. A

malicious website could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks

against the user. ([CVE-2008-0594](/security/CVE-2008-0594))

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel
web browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-0412

    Jesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren and Paul
    Nickerson discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0413

    Carsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, "moz_bug_r_a4", "shutdown",
    Philip Taylor and "tgirmann" discovered crashes in the Javascript
    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0414

    "hong" and Gregory Fleisher discovered that file input focus
    vulnerabilities in the file upload control could allow information
    disclosure of local files.

CVE-2008-0415

    "moz_bug_r_a4" and Boris Zbarsky discovered discovered several
    vulnerabilities in Javascript handling, which could allow
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2008-0417

    Justin Dolske discovered that the password storage machanism could
    be abused by malicious web sites to corrupt existing saved passwords.

CVE-2008-0418

    Gerry Eisenhaur and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that a directory
    traversal vulnerability in chrome: URI handling could lead to
    information disclosure.

CVE-2008-0419

    David Bloom discovered a race condition in the image handling of
    designMode elements, which can lead to information disclosure or
    potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0591

    Michal Zalewski discovered that timers protecting security-sensitive
    dialogs (which disable dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
    could be bypassed by window focus changes through Javascript.

CVE-2008-0592

    It was discovered that malformed content declarations of saved
    attachments could prevent a user in the opening local files
    with a ".txt" file name, resulting in minor denial of service.

CVE-2008-0593

    Martin Straka discovered that insecure stylesheet handling during
    redirects could lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2008-0594

    Emil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that phishing
    protections could be bypassed with <div> elements.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.12-0etch1.

The Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are no
longer supported with security updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2008-11

## Web forgery overwrite with div overlay

Announced
February 7, 2008
Reporter
Emil Ljungdahl, Lars-Olof Moilanen
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.12

### Description

Security researchers **Emil Ljungdahl** and
**Lars-Olof Moilanen** demonstrated that, in cases where
the entire contents of a page are enclosed in a <div> with
absolute positioning, a web forgery warning dialog won't be displayed
unless the user switches tabs away-from then back-to the forgery page.

    Philip Taylor and "tgirmann" discovered crashes in the Javascript
    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0414

    "hong" and Gregory Fleisher discovered that file input focus
    vulnerabilities in the file upload control could allow information
    disclosure of local files.

CVE-2008-0415

    "moz_bug_r_a4" and Boris Zbarsky discovered discovered several
    vulnerabilities in Javascript handling, which could allow
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2008-0417

    Justin Dolske discovered that the password storage machanism could
    be abused by malicious web sites to corrupt existing saved passwords.

CVE-2008-0418

    dialogs (which disable dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
    could be bypassed by window focus changes through Javascript.

CVE-2008-0592

    It was discovered that malformed content declarations of saved
    attachments could prevent a user in the opening local files
    with a ".txt" file name, resulting in minor denial of service.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world뗩 best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft뗩 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren뗪 normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files when submitting a form, to corrupt saved passwords for other
sites, to steal login credentials, or to conduct Cross-Site Scripting
and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.14"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.14"
```

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.9-r1"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.9"
```

All XULRunner users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/xulrunner-1.8.1.14"
```

NOTE: The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) is currently unfixed in
the SeaMonkey binary ebuild, as no precompiled packages have been
released. Until an update is available, we recommend all SeaMonkey
users to disable JavaScript, use Firefox for JavaScript-enabled
browsing, or switch to the SeaMonkey source ebuild.

Seems that the CSS is causing the bug. When I block the referenced stylesheet (<http://business-internet-banking.hsbc.com.hfye223.ph/bibauth/formStart/0.css>) I recieved the warning right away.

The bug is now hidden, but the site in question seems to be gone :-(
Without the site actually there I get the forgery warning right away.
The bug is now hidden so I'm posting your mail to security@mozilla.org that contains additional details:
However, after some research we found out that the bug appears as soon
as all content in the body of a page is contained in a div with absolute
position.
Example follows:
<html><head><title>Test</title>
<style>
#idTag { position: absolute; top: 40; border: 1px solid red; }
#idTag2 { position: absolute; top: 90; border: 1px solid blue; }
</style>
</head><body>
<div id="idTag">Jajaja</div>
<div id="idTag2">&nbsp;</div>
</body></html>

The easiest way to reproduce is maybe these steps:
1. Install local webserver
2. Put the HTML file below in $WEBROOT/firefox/its-a-trap.html
3. Add 127.0.0.1 www.mozilla.com to /etc/hosts
4. Browse to <http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/its-a-trap.html>
<html><head><title>Test</title>
<style>
#idTag { position: absolute; top: 40; border: 1px solid red; }
#idTag2 { position: absolute; top: 90; border: 1px solid blue; }
</style>
</head><body>
<div id="idTag">Jajaja</div>
<div id="idTag2">&nbsp;</div>
</body></html>

even easier, perhaps, would be to hand-edit the array of test urls in components/nsSafebrowsingApplication.js (even in release versions) to contain whatever you need.
I can confirm this bug with that testcase on a local server. Losing focus to another window doesn't do it, but switching back from another tab (which can pre-exist) does.
note: once you've dismissed the webforgery warning you must reload the page to reset the testcase.Status: UNCONFIRMED  NEWEver confirmed: trueWhiteboard: [sg:low spoof]

This doesn't currently apply to Firefox 3 where the current implementation is a complete block (shared with malware blocking). Is that intended to be the final implementation, or an interim step before going back to the FF2-style overlay? Whether this blocks FF3 or not would hinge on that question.Flags: blocking1.8.1.12?Flags: blocking-firefox3?

The FF3 implementation is final, so it sounds like this only applies to FF2.

Attached patch

[remove height check code](attachment.cgi?id=294458&action=diff)
 [Details](attachment.cgi?id=294458&action=edit)
 [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=408164&attachment=294458)

When a page is loading, there is a check to see if content exists before we draw the warning bubble. The content check only looks to see if the height of the body is > 0. In the example cases, body has a height of 0 so we never draw the warning bubble during page load.
This check was originally added because it took a snapshot of the page before drawing the gray over it. This would result it a grey page with no content if content wasn't loaded. This check isn't needed anymore because we re-snapshot the page periodically. So the fix is to just removed this check completely. If a page is loading, we may get the grey over a blank page, but as the page continues loading, the grey overlay will get updated to have the page content. It may look a bit funny if the page never loads (e.g. a hanging GET), but that doesn't seem to be a real problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world뗩 best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft뗩 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren뗪 normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-0414

    "hong" and Gregory Fleisher discovered that file input focus
    vulnerabilities in the file upload control could allow information
    disclosure of local files.

CVE-2008-0415

    "moz_bug_r_a4" and Boris Zbarsky discovered discovered several
    vulnerabilities in Javascript handling, which could allow
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2008-0417

    Justin Dolske discovered that the password storage machanism could
    be abused by malicious web sites to corrupt existing saved passwords.

CVE-2008-0418

    dialogs (which disable dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
    could be bypassed by window focus changes through Javascript.

CVE-2008-0592

    It was discovered that malformed content declarations of saved
    attachments could prevent a user in the opening local files
    with a ".txt" file name, resulting in minor denial of service.
