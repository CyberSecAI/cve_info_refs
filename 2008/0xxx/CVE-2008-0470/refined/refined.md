{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Comodo AntiVirus ActiveX control exposes a method called `ExecuteStr()` that can be called from a web page. This method is not properly secured and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Uncontrolled execution of system commands",
    "Insecure ActiveX control"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious webpage can exploit the vulnerable ActiveX control to execute commands on the user's machine.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or have the victim visit a page with the exploit. The user must have the vulnerable Comodo AntiVirus ActiveX control installed."
