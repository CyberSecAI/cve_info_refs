{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server does not properly sanitize filenames when generating a '406 Not Acceptable' or '300 Multiple Choices' response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "HTTP response splitting"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can upload a file with a malicious name, leading to XSS when a user requests the file, or inject arbitrary HTTP headers, potentially leading to various attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote",
      "Via web requests"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload files to a directory with MultiViews enabled."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "Apache HTTP Server versions 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series",
    "crlf_injection": "The vulnerability allows for CRLF injection in the HTTP response header, which can lead to HTTP response splitting if the filename contains newline characters.",
    "xss_attack": "A file with a malicious name containing JavaScript can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute when the file is requested, exploiting the lack of sanitization.",
    "mitigation": "The issue is corrected by properly escaping filenames in content negotiation responses. Update to Apache 2.2.12 or later."
