Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient randomness in the transaction IDs generated by the Windows DNS client service when performing DNS queries. This lack of entropy makes it easier for attackers to predict these IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable DNS Transaction IDs:** The core issue is the inadequate randomness in the generation of DNS transaction IDs by the Windows DNS client.
- **DNS Spoofing:** Due to the predictability, an attacker can potentially craft malicious DNS responses that are accepted by the vulnerable client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **DNS Spoofing/Redirection:** An attacker can send spoofed DNS responses to a vulnerable client, redirecting internet traffic from legitimate locations to malicious sites of the attacker's choosing. This allows them to impersonate legitimate addresses.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful DNS spoofing can be a stepping stone for various other attacks like phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted DNS responses over a network.
- **Internet Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the internet if a client system performs DNS queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to intercept or send DNS responses to the targeted client.
- **Knowledge of DNS Transactions:** The attacker would need to be able to gain information about or predict the DNS transaction IDs of a client.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Systems:** This vulnerability affected various Windows versions, including Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2, Windows Vista, and their x64 editions.
- **Unaffected Systems:** Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 were not affected.
- **Mitigation:** The security update addresses the vulnerability by increasing the randomness of the transaction IDs used in DNS client communications.
- **No Workarounds:** Microsoft did not identify any workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Public Disclosure:** The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
