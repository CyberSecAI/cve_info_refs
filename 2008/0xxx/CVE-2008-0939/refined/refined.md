Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0939:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to input validation errors in the `wppa.php` script of the Photo Album plugin for WordPress.
*   User-supplied parameters like "photo" or "album" are not properly sanitized when passed to functions like `wppa_album_name()` or `wppa_photo_name()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches/leaks
    *   Privilege escalation (possibly gaining administrative access to the WordPress site)
    *   Denial of service
    *   Manipulation of database records

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.
*   **URL Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are passed via the URL (e.g., `?page_id=13&album=[SQL Injection]`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access to the vulnerable website:** No special access is required.
*   **Ability to manipulate URL parameters:** Attackers need to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions 1.0 and prior of the Photo Album plugin are vulnerable. Version 1.1 was released as a fix.
*   **Exploit Example:** The exploit example provided shows how an attacker can manipulate the `photo` parameter to inject SQL, retrieving the `user_login` and `user_pass` from the `wp_users` table.
    ```
    S@BUN&photo=-333333%2F%2A%2A%2Funion%2F%2A%2A%2Fselect/**/concat(0x7c,user_login,0x7c,user_pass,0x7c)/**/from%2F%2A%2A%2Fwp_users/**WHERE%20admin%201=%201
    ```
*   **Dork:** `allinurl: page_id album "photo"`
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered a "Moderate Risk"
*   **CVE:** CVE-2008-0939
*   **CWE:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command)
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5/10 (as per securityreason.com)
