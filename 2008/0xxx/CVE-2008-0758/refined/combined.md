How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
EztremeZ-IP is a server for Windows which supports both the Apple
Filing Protocol and Line Printer Daemon for the sharing of files and
printers.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------
A] crash through the SLP service
--------------------------------
EztremeZ-IP runs by default with a SLP (Service Location Protocol)
daemon enabled.
The service is affected by a problem during the handling of the number
of available URLs, in fact there are no instructions which check if
the incoming packet can really contain the number of URLs specified in
it.
The resulting effect is the crash of the entire server when a big
amount of URLs is used due to the read access to the unallocated memory
after the packet.
--------------------------------
B] crash through the AFP service
--------------------------------
The UAM field in the AFP protocol is used for choosing a guest access
to the remote devices or a specific type of encrypted/hashed password
for the authentication.
An invalid UAM will cause the crash of the server since it doesn't
check if the type of authentication specified by the client is
available or not.
---------------------------------------------
C] limited directory traversal in Zidget/HTTP
---------------------------------------------
By default is enabled also a small webserver which runs on port 8081
and gives access to the Zidget widget and the master list.
This service is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability which
allows an attacker to download any file in the disk which has one of
the following extensions: gif, png, jpg, xml, ico, zip and html.
There are no other ways for bypassing the extension's limitation,
anyway the XML files are often used as format for the configuration
files of various programs.
The directory traversal can be exploited only with the plain backslash
char, hex chars are not supported by the server.
