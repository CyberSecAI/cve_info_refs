  "CVE-2008-0486": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the FLAC tag parsing of the xine-lib library. This flaw can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted FLAC file.",
    "Root cause": "An array indexing vulnerability when parsing FLAC comments within the open_flac_file() function in demux_flac.c. Specifically, improper handling of FLAC tags can lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application, or a denial of service through application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted FLAC file",
      "User-assisted exploitation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted FLAC file and entice a user to open it using an application that utilizes the vulnerable xine-lib library.",
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is present in xine-lib and MPlayer. Multiple sources confirm that the vulnerability is a buffer overflow triggered while parsing FLAC tags. Affected applications include xine media players and MPlayer. Patches for the flaw have been released for both xine-lib and MPlayer."
