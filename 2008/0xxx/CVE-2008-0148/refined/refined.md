Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0148

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the `cmd.php` file, which allows for arbitrary command execution. The provided text states: "we dont need a permission admin for access to '/php/admin/cmd.php'"

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** The `cmd.php` file directly executes commands provided through the `cmd` parameter.
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The `cmd.php` file is accessible without requiring administrative privileges or any form of authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute any operating system command on the server, potentially leading to:
    - Data Breaches: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information.
    - System Compromise: Taking full control of the server.
    - Denial of Service: Disrupting server operations.
    - Malicious Activity: Installing malware or using the server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a direct HTTP request to the `cmd.php` file.
- **URL Parameter:** The `cmd` URL parameter is used to inject the command to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `cmd.php` file. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is demonstrated with the example: `http://[TARGEt]/[path_TUTOS]/php/admin/cmd.php?cmd=id;ls`
- The provided content also highlights the existence of a phpinfo.php file that might provide additional system details to an attacker.
- The Exploit-DB entry explicitly mentions that no admin permission is needed to access `cmd.php`, confirming the lack of authorization.

The exploit is also demonstrated by directly accessing `http://[TARGEt]/[path_TUTOS]/php/admin/cmd.php` and entering the command in the `CMD(*)` field.
