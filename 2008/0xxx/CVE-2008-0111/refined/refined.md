Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Excel processes data validation records when loading Excel files into memory. Specifically, insufficient validation of this data leads to a potential memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Data Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper checks and validation of data validation records within Excel files, which allows for the injection of malicious data.
- **Memory Corruption:** The insufficient validation can lead to memory corruption which allows an attacker to overwrite portions of memory that may allow arbitrary code to run.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the system, with the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights, if the user has administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Excel File:** The primary attack vector is a malformed or specially crafted Excel file.
    - **Email Attachment:** Attackers can send the malicious file as an email attachment, tricking users into opening it.
    - **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host the malicious file on a website and lure users to download it through social engineering or by exploiting vulnerabilities in compromised sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted Malicious File:** Attackers need the ability to create or modify Excel files to contain the malicious data validation records.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must rely on user interaction (opening the file) for the attack to succeed, there is no indication of automatic exploitation vectors.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need social engineering skills or techniques to convince users to open the crafted Excel file, as the vulnerability is not automatically exploitable.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in several versions of Excel including Office 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007, compatibility packs, and viewers.
- Mitigation includes:
   - Users with fewer rights are less susceptible.
   - The Office Document Open Confirmation Tool can provide warnings, but it is not enabled by default.
   - File Block policy can restrict older format files
- Workarounds include:
    - Using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE)
    - Not opening files from untrusted sources.
- Microsoft had received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure
