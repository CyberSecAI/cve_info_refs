*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0776
*   **Vulnerable Software:** ITechBids v6.0 Gold Edition
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `detail.php` script, specifically through the `item_id` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the `item_id` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords)
    *   Modify or delete database records.
    *   Possibly gain further control over the server or application, depending on database user permissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to `detail.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `item_id` parameter. The example provided uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `admin` table.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can exploit this remotely via a web browser or similar tool by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `detail.php` script. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided exploit example demonstrates how to extract `user_name` and `password` from the `admin` table.
