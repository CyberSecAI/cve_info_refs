Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `flexbb_temp_id` cookie. This is caused by a bug in the template function of FlexBB version 0.6.3. Specifically, the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the cookie, allowing malicious SQL queries to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability within the application's cookie handling mechanism. The `flexbb_temp_id` cookie is not properly validated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive data stored within the database. This includes user credentials like hashed passwords, allowing for further access to the forum and potentially the server.
*  **Database Manipulation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be used to modify or delete data if the database user has those permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `flexbb_temp_id` HTTP cookie. By crafting a malicious SQL query within this cookie, the attacker can manipulate the database queries executed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FlexBB server.
* **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads and manipulate database queries.
* **No authentication:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted cookie without any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit code targets the user password, aiming to extract its hashed value through a character-by-character brute-forcing technique. This technique works by using the injection point to query the database one character at a time using substring and ASCII functions.
* The exploit code is written in Perl using the Tk module for the GUI, and LWP::UserAgent to send HTTP requests.
* The exploit uses `if(ascii(substring((select password from ".$prefix."users where id=$user_id),$i,1))=$num,1,(select 1 union select 2))`. If the current character `i` of the password is equal to the tested `num` then, `1` is returned, otherwise returns a `union` query that is designed to return an error message containing `more than`.
* The exploit is designed to work on mysql versions higher than 4.1
* The exploit code also includes functionality to test the vulnerability and retrieve the database table prefix, `flexbb_`.
* The exploit requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be turned off to properly inject the SQL.
