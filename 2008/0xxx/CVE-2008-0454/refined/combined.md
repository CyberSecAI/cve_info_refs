## Skype does not properly filter input from external websites

#### Vulnerability Note VU#248184

Original Release Date: 2008-01-22 | Last Revised: 2008-04-29

---

### Overview

The Skype client does not properly filter user-supplied input from websites that provide video content to Skype users.

### Description

| Skype is a peer-to-peer application that provides Voice over IP (VoIP) and Instant Messaging services. The Skype client is available for the Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux operating systems.  Skype users can include videos from the Dailymotion and other websites in their mood panel. Videos from these websites are also available via the Skype video browser. Skype does not properly filter user-supplied input that is provided from these third-party websites. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted movie file to a site that provides video content to Skype users. From [SKYPE-SB/2008-001](http://skype.com/security/skype-sb-2008-001.html): Skype Cross Zone Scripting Vulnerability:***Description****Skype uses Internet Explorer web control to render HTML content. This is used also for providing "add video to mood" and "add video to chat" functionality.This is realized over JS/ActiveX interface which allows scripts to be run in Local Zone security context of IE.In order to exploit this an attacker must exploit code injection vulnerability at the partner site. Such vulnerability has been discovered in Dailymotion website.****Discussion****An attacker who constructs a Title of the video in a specific way can cause arbitrary code to be executed on targets PC.For the vulnerability to be triggered, the target must find this video in Skype video gallery browser Dailymotion's section. Watching the video in a Skype chat or in a mood message is safe, as Internet Explorer control is not used.The proof of concept has been made public by Aviv Raff and Miroslav Lucinskij.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Per [SKYPE-SB/2008-001](http://skype.com/security/skype-sb-2008-001.html#section3), Skype has temporarily disabled the ability to add videos from the Dailymotion site until an official fix has been made available. Note that the Dailymotion website contained an XSS vulnerability that could be used as an attack vector, and blocking new videos from the Dailymotion website will not completely address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Include Skype in the Local Machine Zone Lockdown**  Configuring Skype to use the [Local Machine Zone Lockdown](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457150.aspx#EHAA) may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by preventing Skype from evaluating script in the Local Machine Zone. To set Skype in the Local Machine Zone, edit the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE\_LocalMachine\_Lockdown registry entry to include the DWORD value Skype.exe and set the Value data to 1. Skype must be completely quit and restarted for the changes to take effect.Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE\_LocalMachine\_Lockdown] "Skype.exe"=dword:00000001Note that this workaround does not directly address the vulnerability. The workaround may make cause some of Skype's features to fail or to operate with limited functionality. |

# Vulnerabilities in Skype

Thu, 17 Jan 2008 21:03:04 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

[Aviv](http://aviv.raffon.net/2008/01/17/SkypeCrosszoneScriptingVulnerability.aspx) has already done most of the work but I would like to add a few more notes on the recently reported [Skype Cross-site Scripting](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2008/Jan/0328.html) issue. In general, the issue is pretty much underestimated. The vulnerability is not of a type Cross-site Scripting bug, but mostly a Cross-site Scripting bug on [DailyMotion](https://dailymotion.com), which results into a Cross-zone Scripting issue within Skype due to the unlocked IE controller Skype makes use of. When a given resource executes within the Local Zone context, all sorts of things are possible like, including but not only, reading/writing files from the local disc and launching executables through the WSH primitives. Which in simple words means a complete 0wnage.

The attack vector is a bit convoluted, but very much possible and quite practical. The user simply needs to visit DailyMotion via Skype's *Add video to chat* button and stumble upon a movie which contains the Cross-site Scripting vector. This type of scenario can be achieved in several ways but I believe that the most obvious approaches would be to either social engineer the user or spam DailyMotion with hundreds of infected movies that correspond to popular keywords. Aviv pointed out Paris Hilton as an [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples) and I believe that this is a pretty good one.

Both, Aviv and I knew about Skype's Local Zone sandbox for several months now. Yet, this is the first major vulnerability that clearly shows the dangers of Skype's model. However, there is also another attack vector, which needs to be kept in mind, although it works only in networks where the attacker can influence the communication (mitm attacks, packet injection on wifi networks, network spoofing attacks, etc.).

I noticed that parts of the Skype traffic go over unencrypted channel. After further investigation, I found out that the unencrypted packets are part of Skype's ads which are pulled on several places, some of which end up within the unrestricted IE controller. With the help of tools like [Airpwn](http://airpwn.sourceforge.net/Airpwn.html) or [Karma](http://theta44.org/karma/index.html), attackers can easily hijack ads and replace them with malicious ones. Upon rendering, a malicious code will execute within unrestricted IE controller and as such will allow the bad guys in. This type of attack is very easy to pull and it requires almost zero preparation.

*The solution: **lock the Local Zone**. I would recommend not to use Skype on any public HotSpots. Also do not use the **Add video to [chat](https://chatbotkit.com)** feature until a patch is released. Keep in mind that Skype is not the only one affected by these kinds of issues.*

*Archived Comments*

![LiquidIce](//gravatar.com/avatar/a37404362c4adcafe2442489c6c6005f?s=256&d=retro)LiquidIceThere are a few devices that I have seen which cause Windows XP to popup a little tooltip in the task tray saying 'a new device has been detected'. And sometiems when I click on that bubble it opens a webpage.
I have not been able to reproduce this, and have not seen it occur lately... Was it fixed in a windows update? Does this have anything to do with SSDP? I was wondering if it is possible to craft an SSDP packet that will signal other XP computers on the network to show that tooltip. Some of the devices that I have seen do this are the Infrant Readynas and a DLink wifi router. I've also noticed that Sonos causes Windows Media Player to popup a tooltip sometimes as well asking to allow it to share it's media.
Speaking of sonos... this device runs off upnp. Has anyone here been able to do any interesting things with it?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpLiquidIce, I think that you commented on the wrong post. This one has nothing to do with UPnP. :)![Chaim Haas](//gravatar.com/avatar/26f5ebbf54db3ebe672dab93260ea647?s=256&d=retro)Chaim HaasSkype provides a full description of the vulnerability on its [Security Blog](https://share.skype.com/sites/security/2008/01/skype_cross_zone_scripting_vul.html) and the steps that have been taken to neutralize the problem so it doesn't affect users.
