Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0454 (Although the CVE ID is not directly mentioned in the content, the description aligns with the vulnerability detailed in the provided documents.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper filtering of user-supplied input from external websites by the Skype client. Specifically, Skype uses an Internet Explorer web control to render HTML content for features like "add video to mood" and "add video to chat." This web control operates within the Local Zone security context of Internet Explorer, which allows scripts to be run with elevated privileges. The vulnerability was triggered because of an XSS vulnerability present in the Dailymotion website, which allowed an attacker to inject malicious code via video titles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was the presence of an XSS vulnerability on Dailymotion. This allowed attackers to embed malicious scripts into video titles.
*   **Cross-zone Scripting:** The injected XSS payload then resulted in a cross-zone scripting vulnerability within the Skype client due to the use of the IE web control within the local zone.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Skype failed to properly sanitize or filter the input received from third-party video websites like Dailymotion, allowing malicious scripts to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine because of the cross-zone scripting issue. This implies complete system compromise (0wnage).
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker could potentially read or write files from the local disk.
*   **Launching of Executables:** They could launch other executables through Windows Script Host (WSH) primitives.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Videos on Third-party Sites:** Attackers could upload videos with malicious titles to video hosting sites that integrate with Skype, such as Dailymotion.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers on the same network could inject malicious ads into unencrypted Skype traffic, which then could execute malicious code when rendered.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use social engineering to lure users into viewing specially crafted videos, especially those relating to popular keywords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Unauthenticated:** The primary attack vector could be exploited remotely and did not require the attacker to authenticate to the target system.
*   **Ability to Upload Content:** The attacker needs the ability to upload video content to platforms that integrate with Skype and inject malicious code into metadata or content of the videos.
*   **Network Position (for MitM):** For the MitM attack, the attacker needs to be positioned on the same network to intercept and modify Skype's network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Skype temporarily disabled the ability to add videos from Dailymotion to mitigate the risk.
*   A workaround was suggested which involves using Local Machine Zone Lockdown for Skype, but this may limit functionality.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Aviv Raff and Miroslav Lucinskij.
*   The vulnerability is not strictly just a XSS issue but escalates to a cross-zone scripting problem due to Skype's implementation.
