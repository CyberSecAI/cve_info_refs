Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-0109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory calculation error when parsing a specially crafted Word file.
- Specifically, the document contains a "malformed value" that causes a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to a malformed value in a Word file.
- This memory corruption allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** If successful, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, with the same rights as the logged-on user.
- **Malicious Activities:**  Attackers can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Users with administrative rights are at higher risk, as the attacker gains the same level of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachment:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Word file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based Attack:**  An attacker could host a malicious Word file on a website. They would need to trick users into visiting the site and opening the file. Compromised websites can also host this malicious content.
- **Instant Messenger:** Attackers can also distribute links through instant messaging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Word file with a malformed value to trigger the memory corruption.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim, typically via email, website, or messaging.
- No direct user interaction to force exploitation is required (other than the user opening the file), although user interaction is required to initiate the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Word, including Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and Microsoft Word Viewer 2003.
- Office 2000 is considered more vulnerable because it lacks a built-in confirmation prompt before opening documents, while newer versions (XP and later) have this mitigating feature.
- Mitigation includes using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool or the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE).
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Word 2000 and "Important" for other affected versions.
