Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability within the Mini File Host application. The vulnerability exists in the `upload.php` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files on the server by manipulating the `language` parameter in the `upload.php` script. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could read sensitive files on the server. This could include configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
-  Potentially, in some server configurations, code execution could be achieved if the included files can be interpreted by the server (e.g. php files).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `upload.php` page, specifically manipulating the `language` parameter with a path to a local file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the server.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit works by accessing a URL like this:
```
http://server.com/Path/pages/upload.php?language=[-LFI-]
```
where `[-LFI-]` is replaced with the path to the local file the attacker wants to include.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable application is "Mini File Host" version 1.2 or earlier.
- The vulnerability was published on 2008-01-17.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Scary-Boys.
- The application is a PHP based web application.
