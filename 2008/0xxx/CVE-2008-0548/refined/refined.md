- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - **A] NULL pointer in Content-Length:** Lack of error handling after memory allocation using `malloc`. If `malloc` fails and returns `NULL`, the program attempts to use this NULL pointer, resulting in a crash.
    - **B] Off-by-one in the HTTP request:** The program attempts to write a null byte outside the bounds of a buffer when processing an HTTP request of exactly 1328 bytes.
    - **C] crash in OggHeaderParse:** An integer overflow occurs when parsing OGG tags, which leads to `memcpy` being called with an extremely large amount of memory to copy, resulting in a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **A]** Improper error handling for `malloc`.
    - **B]** Off-by-one write.
    - **C]** Integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **A]** Denial of service (crash).
    - **B]** Denial of service (crash). The impact can vary based on OS and build configuration.
    - **C]** Denial of service (crash).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **A]** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a `Content-Length` that causes memory allocation to fail and return a NULL pointer.
    - **B]** Sending a crafted HTTP request with exactly 1328 bytes, which triggers an off-by-one write during null termination.
    - **C]** Sending a crafted OGG stream with specially crafted OGG tags after authenticating to the source mount.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **A, B]** Network access to the Steamcast server to send crafted HTTP requests.
    - **C]** Network access to the Steamcast server and valid credentials to the source mount.
