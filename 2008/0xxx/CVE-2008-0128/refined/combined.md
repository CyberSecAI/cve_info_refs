| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=41217#c0)  Olaf Kock    2006-12-20 05:13:27 UTC  ``` When using the SingleSignOn Valve (org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn) via https the Cookie JSESSIONIDSSO is transmitted without the "secure" attribute, resulting in it being transmitted to any content that is - by purpose or error - requested via http from the same server.   As the content of the SSO-Cookie is confidential (it will lead to automatically logged in sessions in other contexts - https or non-https) this should never happen.  Sorry to have no patch. I've not installed the complete source distribution in my development environment, but it seems the points to change are  org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.register(...), the code of interest being (from 5.5.30 source distribution)              Cookie cookie = new Cookie(Constants.SINGLE_SIGN_ON_COOKIE, ssoId);             cookie.setMaxAge(-1);             cookie.setPath("/");             hres.addCookie(cookie);  As hres is an org.apache.catalina.HttpRequest, and I've looked through the code to find org.apache.catalina.Request.setSecure() but no ...isSecure() (though this is mentioned in the Javadoc for ...setSecure()) I suppose there needs to be another change to provide isSecure on Request or HttpRequest, but this is difficult to tell only from the editor. If isSecure() was there, there'd be a              cookie.setSecure(hres.isSecure())  missing in the statements above... ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=41217#c1)  Chris Halstead    2007-01-11 17:15:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 19397](attachment.cgi?id=19397&action=diff "Patch to set secure flag on SSO cookie when requested over https") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=19397&action=edit "Patch to set secure flag on SSO cookie when requested over https") Patch to set secure flag on SSO cookie when requested over https  There is an isSecure() method available in the Request object used by AuthenticatorBase...not sure why you couldn't find it.	Attaching a patch that sets the secure flag on the SSO cookie when accessed via https. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=41217#c2)  Mark Thomas    2007-01-13 19:19:17 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in svn. Many thanks for the patch. The fix will be in 5.5.21 onwards. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=41217#c3)  Olaf Kock    2007-01-22 02:03:09 UTC  ``` Thanks for the fix - I believe I did not see the Request method because I had no IDE environment ready for tomcat source and just browsed through the source in a simple text editor - it's a lot easier to miss methods there. Olaf ``` |  |

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1468-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : tomcat5.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0128 CVE-2007-2450

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-0128

    Olaf Kock discovered that HTTPS encryption was insufficiently
    enforced for single-sign-on cookies, which could result in
    information disclosure.

CVE-2007-2450

    It was discovered that the Manager and Host Manager web applications
    performed insufficient input sanitising, which could lead to cross-
    site scripting.

This update also adapts the tomcat5.5-webapps package to the tightened
JULI permissions introduced in the previous tomcat5.5 DSA. However, it
should be noted, that the tomcat5.5-webapps is for demonstration and
documentation purposes only and should not be used for production
systems.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.20-2etch2.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# RHSA-2008:0630 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: Red Hat Network Satellite Server security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This
update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network
Satellite Server components.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

During an internal security audit, it was discovered that Red Hat Network
Satellite Server shipped with an XML-RPC script, manzier.pxt, which had a
single hard-coded authentication key. A remote attacker who is able to
connect to the Satellite Server XML-RPC service could use this flaw to
obtain limited information about Satellite Server users, such as login
names, associated email addresses, internal user IDs, and partial
information about entitlements. (CVE-2008-2369)

This release also corrects several security vulnerabilities in various
components shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1. In a
typical operating environment, these components are not exposed to users
of Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will
reduce risk in unique Satellite Server environments.

A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in mod\_perl. (CVE-2007-1349)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were fixed in the image map feature in
the JFreeChart package. (CVE-2007-6306)

A flaw which could result in weak encryption was fixed in the
perl-Crypt-CBC package. (CVE-2006-0898)

Multiple flaws were fixed in the Apache Tomcat package. (CVE-2005-4838,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- Acroread wrapper script minor /tmp race
Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 contained a /tmp race in its "acroread"
wrapper script in the SSL certificate handling. (CVE-2008-0883)
This problem is not triggered by just starting acrobat reader,
but only on certificate handling.
Furthermore Acrobat Reader contained several duplicated copies of
system libraries, which have been removed by this update to make sure
they are up-to-date security wise by using the system provided ones.
Also on x86-64 platforms, the Mozilla embedding detection did not
work and was fixed, so the Splashscreen and Help are again displayed.
Updates have been released on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10,
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
Updates for version 7 for Novell Linux Desktop 9 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 are still pending.
- Asterisk security issues
A security update was released for the PBX Asterisk, fixing following
security issues:
CVE-2007-6430: Attackers could bypass host based authentication by
using a valid user name.
CVE-2007-6170: Attackers could inject SQL commands under certain
circumstances if 'cdr\_pgsql' was used.
Asterisk was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- cacti various vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were fixed in cacti:
- CVE-2008-0783: multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- CVE-2008-0784: path disclosure
- CVE-2008-0785: multiple SQL injections
- CVE-2008-0786: HTTP response splitting on very old PHP instances
Cacti is included in SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and
was fixed there.
- compat-openssl097g security fixes
This update of compat-openssl097g fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow
in function SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers(). This vulnerability potentially
allows remote code execution; depending on memory layout of the
process. (CVE-2007-5135)
We released updates for openssl already, but an update for the compat
0.9.7g openssl libraries was missing and is provided with this patch.
Released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE
10.2, 10.3.
- icu regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could crash the ICU library
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771).
Updated icu packages have been released for all distributions.
- libcdio buffer overflow
A security bug was fixed in libcdio. Long file names in ISO file
systems with Joliet extension could cause a buffer overflow in
libcdio (CVE-2007-6613).
libcdio fixes were released for all SUSE Linux products.
- wireshark/ethereal security problems
The network analyzer wireshark (formerly known as ethereal) was
updated to fix the following security bugs:
- CVE-2008-1070: The SCTP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1071: The SNMP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1072: The TFTP dissector could crash Wireshark (maybe
a bug in the Cairo library on specific platforms)
- Jakarta Tomcat security problems
Various security issues in Jakarta Tomcat have been fixed:
- CVE-2006-7196: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
example JSP applications
- CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character
- CVE-2007-3385: Handling of \" in cookies
- CVE-2007-5461: tomcat path traversal / information leak
- CVE-2007-1860: directory traversal
- CVE-2008-0128: tomcat https information disclosure
- CVE-2005-2090: tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
Updates have been released for all distributions.
- perl-Tk GIF security problem
Specially crafted GIF files could crash perl-Tk (CVE-2006-4484).
Fixed packages have been released for all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

As the content of the SSO-Cookie is confidential (it will lead to automatically logged in sessions in other contexts - https or non-https) this should never happen. """  Also according to the asf bz the upstream versions before 5.5.21 are vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=429821#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-04 21:31:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0602 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0602.html>   ``` |  |
