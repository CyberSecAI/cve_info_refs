{
  "Root cause": "The application uses user-controlled input `$path` in `require_once()` statements without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Multiple Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if they can include a file containing malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `path` parameter in HTTP GET requests to various PHP files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The server must have 'register_globals' set to 'On' and 'magic_quotes_gpc' set to 'Off'."
