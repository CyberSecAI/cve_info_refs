| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Office Excel Viewer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=1CD6ACF9-CE06-4E1C-8DCF-F33F669DBC3A&displaylang=en) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5338']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. Exploitation requires that the attacker coerce the target into opening a malicious .XLS file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of malformed cell comments. When Excel encounters a malformed record it attempts to rebuild the broken meta-data. A flaw in this rebuilding process allows the user to specify critical data offsets eventually leading to code execution under the logged in users credentials. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-016.mspx> |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-016 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (949030)

Published: March 11, 2008 | Updated: April 30, 2008

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a malformed Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office 2000 and rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Office Excel Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Office Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3, and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office allocates memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information.**

**Recommendation.**Â  Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately

**Known Issues.**Â None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Microsoft Office Cell Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0113

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a malformed file which could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0113](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0113).

#### Mitigating Factors for the Microsoft Office Cell Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0113

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.
* Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* 2007 Microsoft Office System is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for the Microsoft Office Cell Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0113

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when added to the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats is used to more securely open Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office 2003 CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the Ã¢ÂÂMicrosoft Baseline Security AnalyzerÃ¢ÂÂ heading under the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,** earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
