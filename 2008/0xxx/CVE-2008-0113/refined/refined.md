Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue during the parsing of malformed cell comments within Microsoft Excel's BIFF file format. Specifically, when Excel encounters a malformed record, it attempts to rebuild the broken metadata. However, a flaw in this rebuilding process allows the attacker to manipulate critical data offsets, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that occurs due to the flawed handling of malformed cell comments.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of the structure and data within cell comments leads to the vulnerability, allowing for malformed data to be processed.
*   **Inadequate Memory Allocation:** The process of rebuilding broken metadata has a flawed allocation process that is exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control over the affected system, with the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can achieve the same level of control. Users with fewer rights could be less impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted Excel file (.XLS) containing malformed cell comments.
*   **Email Attachment:** The malicious file can be delivered as an email attachment.
*   **Compromised Website:** The file could also be hosted on a malicious or compromised website, and users would need to be convinced to download and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious File:** The attacker must be able to create a malformed .XLS file that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability during parsing.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince the user to open the malicious file, either by email or through a website.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered specifically during the parsing of malformed cell comments.
*   The flawed metadata rebuilding process allows attackers to specify critical data offsets.
*   The vulnerability can lead to code execution under the logged-in user's credentials.

**Affected Products:**

*   Microsoft Office Excel Viewer 2003
*   Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003
*   Microsoft Office 2000
*   Microsoft Office XP
*   Microsoft Office 2003
*   Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac

**Mitigation and Workarounds:**

*   Applying the security update released by Microsoft resolves this vulnerability.
*   Using Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) can help to more securely open files.
*   Use of Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents can act as a mitigation strategy.
*   Users are advised to not open files from untrusted sources or unexpected files from trusted sources.
