Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2008-0068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of path delimiters in HTTP requests to HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) CGIs. Specifically, the CGIs filter backslashes (\) but not forward slashes (/), allowing for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The web interface (CGIs) of HP OpenView NNM fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the path delimiters in file paths within the parameters, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directories by using forward slashes (`/`) instead of backslashes (`\`).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   `ovalarmsrv` service can be frozen by sending incomplete multi-line requests, leading to 100% CPU usage and inability to process new requests. This is because the service expects a specific number of sub-arguments based on a provided parameter. By not providing the correct number, the service hangs.
    *   `ovalarmsrv` service crashes due to NULL pointer dereference when a large, unallocatable amount of memory is requested, due to an insufficient amount of sub arguments requested, leading to a null pointer when allocating for sub arguments
    *   `ovtopmd` service can be terminated by sending a specific packet (0x36) to its port, causing a process termination and thus, a denial of service.
*  **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The identified vulnerabilities are accessible remotely without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem via directory traversal, potentially including configuration files and other confidential data.
*   **Denial of Service:** The service freezes or process termination can disrupt the availability of the network management software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The directory traversal vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable CGIs.
*   **Network Requests:** The DoS vulnerabilities are exploited by sending crafted network requests to the services' ports (2954 for `ovalarmsrv` and 2532 for `ovtopmd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the target server running HP OpenView NNM.
*   **No authentication required** to exploit the identified vulnerabilities
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP and network protocols** to craft the specific packets/requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.
