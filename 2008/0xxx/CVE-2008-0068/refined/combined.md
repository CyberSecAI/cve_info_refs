How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Application: HP OpenView Network Node Manager
http://www.openview.hp.com/products/nnm/
Versions: <= 7.53
Platforms: Windows (tested), Solaris, Linux, HP-UX
Bugs: A] CGIs directory traversal
B] Denial of Service in ovalarmsrv
C] NULL pointer in ovalarmsrv
D] process termination in ovtopmd
Exploitation: remote
Date: 11 Apr 2008
Author: Luigi Auriemma
e-mail: aluigi@autistici.org
web: aluigi.org

4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
From vendor's website:
OpenView NNM "automates the process of developing a hyper-accurate
topology of your physical network, virtual network services and the
complex relationships between them. It then uses that topology as the
basis for intelligent root cause analysis to enhance network
availability and performance."
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
---------------------------
A] CGIs directory traversal
---------------------------
The CGIs available in NNM use some instructions which filter malicious
chars in the parameters passed by the clients, for example to avoid
directory traversal attacks, XSS and so on.
The path delimiter filtered by these CGIs is the backslash char, so
using the slash will allow an attacker to download the files from the
disk on which is installed NNM.
----------------------------------
B] Denial of Service in ovalarmsrv
----------------------------------
The ovalarmsrv service listening on port 2954 can be easily freezed
with CPU at 100% and without the possibility of handling further
requests on both its ports 2953 and 2954 simply sending an incomplete
multi line request.
In short the last numeric parameters of the requests 25, 45, 46, 47 and
81 is used to specify how much sub-arguments (one per line) will be
sent.
So ovalarmsrv starts a loop which terminates when all the sub arguments
are received; closing the connection or not sending all or part of
these arguments will freeze the entire service.
The following are all the supported requests and their "sscanf" format:
REQUEST\_CONTRIB\_EVENTS (22): "%d %d %s"
REQUEST\_PRINT (25): "%d %d %d %d %s"
REQUEST\_DETAILS (33): "%d %d %s"
REQUEST\_EVENT\_DELETE (35): "%d %d %s"
REQUEST\_EVENT\_ACK (36): "%d %d %s"
REQUEST\_RUN\_ACTION (37): "%d %d %s %s"
REQUEST\_SPECDATA (41):
REQUEST\_EVENT\_UNACK (44): "%d %d %s"
REQUEST\_SAVE (45): "%d %d %d %d %s"
REQUEST\_CAT\_CHANGE (46): "%d %d %d %[^\n]"
REQUEST\_SEV\_CHANGE (47): "%d %d %d %[^\n]"
REQUEST\_CONF\_ACTIONS (48): "%d %d\n"
REQUEST\_RESTORE\_STATE (62): "%d %[^\n]"
REQUEST\_SAVE\_DIR (63):
REQUEST\_LOCALE (66): "%d"
REQUEST\_FORMAT\_PRINT (81): "%d %d %d %d %s"
REQUEST\_CONF\_RUN\_ACTION (??): "%d %d %d %[^\n]"
-----------------------------
C] NULL pointer in ovalarmsrv
-----------------------------
The parameter which specifies the amount of sub-arguments described
above is used to allocate a certain amount of initial dynamic memory
(value \* 2) for storing all the sub-arguments which is then
reallocated wheen needed.
Specifying a too big unallocable amount of sub-arguments results in a
NULL pointer which will crash the service.
---------------------------------
D] process termination in ovtopmd
---------------------------------
The ovtopmd service listening on port 2532 uses a special type of
packet (0x36) for forcing the termination of the process ("Exiting due
to request of ovtopmd -k."), so an attacker can use this packet for
causing a Denial of Service.
