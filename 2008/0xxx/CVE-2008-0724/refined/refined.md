{
  "CVE-2008-0724": {
    "Description": "The Everything Development System Pre-1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'node_id' parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), or privilege escalation. Passwords are stored in the database as plaintext, making user accounts very easily compromised.",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when processing the 'node_id' parameter, before using it in an SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Plaintext password storage"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure, XSS, privilege escalation, and account compromise due to plaintext passwords.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with a maliciously crafted 'node_id' parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and knowledge of SQL syntax."
