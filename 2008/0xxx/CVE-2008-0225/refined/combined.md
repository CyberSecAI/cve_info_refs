How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

Package        : xine-lib
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0225

Luigi Auriemma discovered that the Xine media player library performed
insufficient input sanitising during the handling of RTSP streams,
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.8-3+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-5.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0.1-1sarge6.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Bug: heap overflow in rmff\_dump\_header
Exploitation: remote
Date: 08 Jan 2008
Author: Luigi Auriemma
e-mail: aluigi@autistici.org

===============
1) Introduction
===============
Xine is a player and a library used in many open source media players
like Kaffeine, Totem and so on.
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
There is a heap overflow in the rmff\_dump\_header function in rmff.c
called by rtsp\_session\_start when a Real Helix server is found, where
the "max" field (the max size of buffer/rtsp\_session->header) is not
considered.
From input/libreal/rmff.c:
int rmff\_dump\_header(rmff\_header\_t \*h, char \*buffer, int max) {
int written=0;
rmff\_mdpr\_t \*\*stream=h->streams;
rmff\_dump\_fileheader(h->fileheader, &buffer[written]);
written+=h->fileheader->size;
rmff\_dump\_prop(h->prop, &buffer[written]);
written+=h->prop->size;
rmff\_dump\_cont(h->cont, &buffer[written]);
written+=h->cont->size;
if (stream)
{
while(\*stream)
{
rmff\_dump\_mdpr(\*stream, &buffer[written]);
written+=(\*stream)->size;
stream++;
}
}
rmff\_dump\_dataheader(h->data, &buffer[written]);
written+=18;
return written;
}
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
use a SDP data like the following:
a=Abstract:buffer;"QUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFB...40000\_of\_QUFBQUFB's...FBQUFB"
I have chosen QUFBQUFB because then it's decoded as AAAAAA

# xine-lib: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200801-12**

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple heap-based buffer overflows when
processing RTSP streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.9.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.9.1** |

### Background

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma reported that xine-lib does not properly check
boundaries when processing SDP attributes of RTSP streams, leading to
heap-based buffer overflows.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to play specially crafted RTSP video
streams with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
player.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.9.1"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Lars Hartmann    2008-01-10 13:05:12 UTC  ``` The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the "rmff_dump_cont()" function in input/libreal/rmff.c when processing the SDP "Title", "Author", Copyright", and "Abstract" attributes. These can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into connecting to a malicious RTSP server.  Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.  The vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 1.1.9. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: no upstream fix avaible, so "Do not connect to untrusted streaming servers."... ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-10 13:55:32 UTC  ``` Media-video, please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Alexis Ballier   gentoo-dev  2008-01-11 18:02:42 UTC  ``` xine-lib 1.1.9.1 is in the tree and candidate for stable, see changelog why there is a -r1 too... ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-13 14:15:24 UTC  ``` Arches please test and mark stable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

## Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP

parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-0073](/security/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check

buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an

RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0225](/security/CVE-2008-0225), [CVE-2008-0238](/security/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not

properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](/security/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly

check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](/security/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not

properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](/security/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV,

MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1482](/security/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input

when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an

attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](/security/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib

when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted

NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1878](/security/CVE-2008-1878))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-14 08:20:29 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2008-0225](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0225) to the following vulnerability:  Heap-based buffer overflow in the rmff_dump_cont function in input/libreal/rmff.c in xine-lib 1.1.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the SDP Abstract attribute, related to the rmff_dump_header function and related to disregarding the max field.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  References:  <http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/xinermffhof-adv.txt> <http://secunia.com/advisories/28384>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-14 08:27:56 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in upstream version 1.1.9.1:  <http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=567872&group_id=9655>  Updates to F7 and F8 are pending approval.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c2)  Ville Skyttä    2008-01-14 21:48:51 UTC  ``` Note that I submitted the F7 update "only" to testing, because I do not have a F7 box to test with and it's an update from 1.1.7 to 1.1.9.1.  The F8 update works fine for me and I requested it to be pushed straight to the non-testing updates repo.  BTW, could the script (?) you guys use to add security bugzilla entries be modified so that it auto-Cc's co-maintainers as well as the primary package owner?  Is the script (?) publically available somewhere?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-15 08:01:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c2)) > The F8 update works fine for me and I requested it to be pushed straight to  > the non-testing updates repo.  Can you please have a look at #428621 too?  That's another xine-lib issue that got CVE id.  However, reference point to the same Secunia advisory as this one, just wording seems to cover other exploitation vectors not originally described in reporter's mail.  Looking into the patch referenced by 1.1.9.1 release notes, those additional vectors seem to be addressed to.  But I would appreciate some ack from someone more familiar with xine-lib.  > BTW, could the script (?) you guys use to add security bugzilla entries be > modified so that it auto-Cc's co-maintainers as well as the primary package > owner?  Current CC list it based on package ownership as known to Bugzilla.  Can you recommend any source from where co-maintainers list can be extracted in automated way?  pkgdb list of co-maintainers, but I do not see any obvious way to turn that to list of Bugzilla emails/logins to CC the bug to.  > Is the script (?) publically available somewhere?  fedora-security repo should already contain it.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-15 22:54:25 UTC  ``` xine-lib-1.1.9.1-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 testing repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.  If you want to test the update, you can install it with   su -c 'yum --enablerepo=updates-testing update xine-lib'   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-15 23:11:28 UTC  ``` xine-lib-1.1.9.1-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=428620#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-08 15:48:17 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream version xine-lib-1.1.10-1 currently available in all stable Fedora versions, closing.   ``` |  |
