Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the 'years' parameter in the `countdown.php` script before it's used in an SQL query. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `years` parameter, before incorporating it into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Partial Integrity Impact:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Partial Availability Impact:** An attacker might be able to disrupt the normal operation of the application or cause a denial-of-service by manipulating data or the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, likely through a web interface. The vulnerable parameter is accessible via HTTP requests.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the 'years' parameter in the HTTP request to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable script (`countdown.php`) and the parameter (`years`).
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- **Vulnerable Software:** LI-countdown, developed by LI-Scripts.
- **Vulnerable Script:** `countdown.php`.
- **Condition:** The vulnerability is exploitable if `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to `off`.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS Base Score is 7.5/10, indicating a high severity.
- **Exploitability Subscore:** 10/10, meaning it's easy to exploit.
- **Solution:** No patch was available at the time of this report.
- **PoC/Exploit:** No proof of concept or exploit was available at the time of this report.
