How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 14:47:56 UTC  ``` Whilst investigating a VMWare reported buffer overflow vulnerability ([bug #426568](show_bug.cgi?id=426568 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2007-5360 tog-pegasus pam authentication buffer overflow")) in the PAM authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server that didn't affect Red Hat packages, I found another one that did.  This vulnerability can be exploited remotely and results in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the cimserver process.  Note that we do ship with a default SELinux policy for this package.  Current embargo is unset.  Likely to be 2nd week of Jan 2008.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 14:50:10 UTC  ``` This is a problem inside PAMBasicAuthenticator::PAMCallback()                  //                                                                               // copy the user password                                                        //                                                                               resp[i]->resp = (char *)malloc(PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE);                 strcpy(resp[i]->resp, mydata->userPassword);                 resp[i]->resp_retcode = 0;                 break;  But mydata->userPassword is in this case 2000 characters, and PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE is 512 leading to a stack buffer overflow.  Exploiting this will be tricky as ExecShield is in use and we ship a default SELinux targetted policy for this server.     ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-02 08:55:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 290635](attachment.cgi?id=290635&action=diff "proposed patch from Roger Kumpf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=290635&action=edit "proposed patch from Roger Kumpf") proposed patch from Roger Kumpf   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:26:09 UTC  ``` Description for advisory:  During a security audit, a stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the PAM authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server. An unauthenticated remote user could trigger this flaw and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2008-0003](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0003))    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c8)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:31:54 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The tog-pegasus package is not installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.    tog-pegasus supplied by Red Hat binds only to one port (as plain http is disabled), port 5989.  The default firewall installed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux will block remote access to this port.  In normal use it's unlikely you'd want to have this port accessible outside of an intranet anyway, and it's likely to be blocked by enterprise border firewalls.  However if tog-pegasus has been installed and unblocked through the fireware, the Red Hat Security Response Team believes that it would still be hard to remotely exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code due to the default SELinux targeted policy on Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, and the SELinux memory protections enabled by default on Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c9)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:42:19 UTC  ``` When I found this issue I contacted OpenGroup (by email and phone) and other possibly affected vendors via vendor-sec and suggested an embargo date of '2nd week of January', we later clarified this as 'Jan 9th'.  OpenGroup committed a fix for this issue last week (but without any notice of security implications) and due to the high severity of this issue we're bringing the embargo forward to Jan 7th.   <http://www.openpegasus.org/pm/show_mail.tpl?CALLER=index.tpl&source=L&listname=pegasus-commit&id=20965&listid=pegasus-commit> <http://cvs.opengroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/pegasus/src/Pegasus/Security/Cimservera/Attic/cimservera.cpp.diff?cvsroot=Pegasus&r1=1.6&r2=1.6.32.1&f=H&only_with_tag=RELEASE_2_6-branch>     ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c10)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:43:36 UTC  ``` After installing the update you need to restart tog-pegasus in the usual way.  You can do this by running "service tog-pegasus restart"   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c12)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 18:20:43 UTC  ``` opening bug   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-07 18:43:33 UTC  ``` Updated packages were released for affected versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux:    <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0002.html>    ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c15)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-08 08:41:58 UTC  ``` Opening up [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c1) as VMWare have now published their similar flaw in OpenPegasus, <http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=119975801904357&w=2>  See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5360> for that issue (which doesn't affect us)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c19)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-11 22:18:08 UTC  ``` tog-pegasus-2.6.0-3.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c20)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-11 22:26:03 UTC  ``` tog-pegasus-2.6.1-3.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 14:47:56 UTC  ``` Whilst investigating a VMWare reported buffer overflow vulnerability ([bug #426568](show_bug.cgi?id=426568 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2007-5360 tog-pegasus pam authentication buffer overflow")) in the PAM authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server that didn't affect Red Hat packages, I found another one that did.  This vulnerability can be exploited remotely and results in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the cimserver process.  Note that we do ship with a default SELinux policy for this package.  Current embargo is unset.  Likely to be 2nd week of Jan 2008.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2007-12-22 14:50:10 UTC  ``` This is a problem inside PAMBasicAuthenticator::PAMCallback()                  //                                                                               // copy the user password                                                        //                                                                               resp[i]->resp = (char *)malloc(PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE);                 strcpy(resp[i]->resp, mydata->userPassword);                 resp[i]->resp_retcode = 0;                 break;  But mydata->userPassword is in this case 2000 characters, and PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE is 512 leading to a stack buffer overflow.  Exploiting this will be tricky as ExecShield is in use and we ship a default SELinux targetted policy for this server.     ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-02 08:55:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 290635](attachment.cgi?id=290635&action=diff "proposed patch from Roger Kumpf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=290635&action=edit "proposed patch from Roger Kumpf") proposed patch from Roger Kumpf   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:26:09 UTC  ``` Description for advisory:  During a security audit, a stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the PAM authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server. An unauthenticated remote user could trigger this flaw and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2008-0003](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0003))    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c8)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:31:54 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The tog-pegasus package is not installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.    tog-pegasus supplied by Red Hat binds only to one port (as plain http is disabled), port 5989.  The default firewall installed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux will block remote access to this port.  In normal use it's unlikely you'd want to have this port accessible outside of an intranet anyway, and it's likely to be blocked by enterprise border firewalls.  However if tog-pegasus has been installed and unblocked through the fireware, the Red Hat Security Response Team believes that it would still be hard to remotely exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code due to the default SELinux targeted policy on Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, and the SELinux memory protections enabled by default on Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c9)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-07 08:42:19 UTC  ``` When I found this issue I contacted OpenGroup (by email and phone) and other possibly affected vendors via vendor-sec and suggested an embargo date of '2nd week of January', we later clarified this as 'Jan 9th'.  OpenGroup committed a fix for this issue last week (but without any notice of security implications) and due to the high severity of this issue we're bringing the embargo forward to Jan 7th.   <http://www.openpegasus.org/pm/show_mail.tpl?CALLER=index.tpl&source=L&listname=pegasus-commit&id=20965&listid=pegasus-commit> <http://cvs.opengroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/pegasus/src/Pegasus/Security/Cimservera/Attic/cimservera.cpp.diff?cvsroot=Pegasus&r1=1.6&r2=1.6.32.1&f=H&only_with_tag=RELEASE_2_6-branch>     ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=426578#c10)  Mark J.

```
It seems that some vulndbs have got a bit confused by the OpenPegasus
issues that were reported a couple of weeks ago.  That misinformation is
working it's way up into public reports.  So, for the record:

In December 2007, VMWare contacted the vendor-sec mailing list to let us
know they'd found a pre-authentication buffer overflow in OpenPegasus
versions prior to 2.7.  This issue was credited as being discovered by
Alexander Sotirov of VMware and allocated CVE-2007-5360.

This overflow only affected OpenPegasus builds that had been compiled to
use PAM and with the (optional) PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC define.
This issue affected the VMWare OpenPegasus builds, but not the Red Hat
OpenPegasus builds.

<http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=119975801904357&w=2>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-5360>

However, whilst investigating this issue, the Red Hat Security Response
Team discovered that there was a similar pre-authentication buffer
overflow affecting OpenPegasus versions prior to 2.7, but this time it
affected servers that had been compiled with PAM but without the
PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC define, and was in a different piece of
code to the CVE-2007-5360 flaw.  This issue did affect the Red Hat
OpenPegasus builds.  We allocated CVE-2008-0003 to this issue.

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0002.html>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0003>

Both of the issues were corrected upstream by a single patch, attached to
OpenPegasus bug 7220, the patch was written by Roger Kumpf.  Versions 2.7
were already not vulnerable as both bits of affected code had been
refactored for that release.
<http://cvs.opengroup.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7220>

Thanks, Mark

## Synopsis

Critical: tog-pegasus security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0002)

## Topic

Updated tog-pegasus packages that fix a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The tog-pegasus packages provide OpenPegasus Web-Based Enterprise
Management (WBEM) services. WBEM is a platform and resource independent
DMTF standard that defines a common information model, and communication
protocol for monitoring and controlling resources.

During a security audit, a stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the PAM
authentication code in the OpenPegasus CIM management server. An
unauthenticated remote user could trigger this flaw and potentially execute
arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2008-0003)

Note that the tog-pegasus packages are not installed by default on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. The Red Hat Security Response Team believes that it would
be hard to remotely exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code, due to
the default SELinux targeted policy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5,
and the SELinux memory protection tests enabled by default on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.

Users of tog-pegasus should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
updated packages the tog-pegasus service should be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
