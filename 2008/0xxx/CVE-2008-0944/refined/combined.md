How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Ipswitch Instant Messaging (IM) is a client/server messaging software.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
-----------------------------------------------------
A] pre-auth NULL pointer crash in decryption function
-----------------------------------------------------
IM uses the 3DES encryption with a fixed key ("ipswitch") for
encrypting the network traffic and the only data which is in clear-text
are the first 8 bytes exchanged at the beginning of each connection
which are the version number of the program.
If an attacker uses a version number equal to zero (no encryption?)
will be able to crash the server due to the access to a NULL pointer
during the decryption of the incoming data.
Note that this bug affects both the server and client application so an
attacker can easily crash all the clients in the LAN sending the
malformed data to the port 5178 of each host since this is the default
port on which they listen.
---------------------------
B] format string in logging
---------------------------
The logging function used by IM is affected by a format string
vulnerability.
The way I have found for exploiting this vulnerability is through a
message sent to an user who has a malformed client IP string.
So is possible to do this using two accounts (in my tests sending a
message to himself doesn't seem to work for this bug) or in many other
ways like sending a message to another user which when will reply will
also exploit the vulnerability.
When the server will try to connect to the IP specified by the target
client it will fail since it's not a valid IP (255.255.255.255
INADDR\_NONE) and will create an error message similar to the following
subsequently passed directly to sprintf without the needed format
argument:
"Queueing message for username@host. Unexpected Error = 10049, Failed to connect to client\_IP. on port client\_port.."
---------------------------------
C] arbitrary empty files creation
---------------------------------
IM creates index files for storing pointers to the entries of its
database in which are stored the messages of the users.
The problem here is that these index files are created in append mode
using the name of the target of the message plus the "@hostname.idx"
suffix (like username@myhost.idx) without checking if the file has been
created outside the Logs folder.
Currently the only way I have found for writing files with arbitrary
names is through the char ':' appended at the end of the target
username which allows to drop the additional suffix added by the
program.
Anyway, although interesting, this bug can't be defined a real
vulnerability since it's possible to create new files anywhere in the
disk where is installed IM but is not possible to overwrite or append
garbage data (the index data about I talked before) to the existent
ones.

which are the version number of the program.
If an attacker uses a version number equal to zero (no encryption?)
will be able to crash the server due to the access to a NULL pointer
during the decryption of the incoming data.
Note that this bug affects both the server and client application so an
attacker can easily crash all the clients in the LAN sending the
malformed data to the port 5178 of each host since this is the default
port on which they listen.
---------------------------
B] format string in logging
---------------------------
The logging function used by IM is affected by a format string
vulnerability.
The way I have found for exploiting this vulnerability is through a
message sent to an user who has a malformed client IP string.
So is possible to do this using two accounts (in my tests sending a
message to himself doesn't seem to work for this bug) or in many other
ways like sending a message to another user which when will reply will
also exploit the vulnerability.
When the server will try to connect to the IP specified by the target
client it will fail since it's not a valid IP (255.255.255.255
INADDR\_NONE) and will create an error message similar to the following
subsequently passed directly to sprintf without the needed format
argument:
"Queueing message for username@host. Unexpected Error = 10049, Failed to connect to client\_IP. on port client\_port.."
---------------------------------
C] arbitrary empty files creation
---------------------------------
IM creates index files for storing pointers to the entries of its
database in which are stored the messages of the users.
The problem here is that these index files are created in append mode
using the name of the target of the message plus the "@hostname.idx"
suffix (like username (at) myhost (dot) idx [email concealed]) without checking if the file has been
created outside the Logs folder.
Actually the only way I have found for writing files with arbitrary
names is through the char ':' appended at the end of the target
username which allows to drop the additional suffix added by the
program.
Anyway, although interesting, this bug can't be defined a real
vulnerability since it's possible to create new files anywhere in the
disk where is installed IM but is not possible to overwrite or append
garbage data (the index data about I talked before) to the existent
ones.
