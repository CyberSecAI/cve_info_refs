Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0932:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `diatheke.pl` script in SWORD does not properly sanitize shell meta-characters in the "range" parameter before processing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Shell command injection vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
- The commands are executed with the privileges of the user running SWORD (typically the web server account).
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the webserver.
- Potential for resource consumption attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker injects specially crafted input through the `range` parameter.
- This parameter is passed to the shell without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running `diatheke.pl`.
- No specific user privileges on the system itself are needed.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Dan Dennison.
- Patches were created and applied to different distributions including Gentoo, Debian and Fedora.
- The vulnerability was considered a critical security issue by Debian.
- The vulnerable script `diatheke.pl` is a CGI program intended for creating Bible study websites.
- Specific vulnerable versions were identified in various Linux distributions:
    - Gentoo: `< 1.5.8-r2`
    - Debian: `< 1.5.9-8` (sid), `< 1.5.7-7sarge1` (sarge), `< 1.5.9-2etch1` (etch)
    - Fedora: `sword-1.5.10-2`
- Red Hat stated they did not ship the vulnerable script, so this was marked as not a bug.
