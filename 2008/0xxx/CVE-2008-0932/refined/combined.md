# SWORD: Shell command injection — GLSA **200803-06**

Insufficient input checking in SWORD may allow shell command injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/sword** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.8-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.8-r2** |

### Background

SWORD is a library for Bible study software.

### Description

Dan Dennison reported that the diatheke.pl script used in SWORD does
not properly sanitize shell meta-characters in the "range" parameter
before processing it.

### Impact

A remote attacker could provide specially crafted input to a vulnerable
application, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
shell commands with the privileges of the user running SWORD (generally
the web server account).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SWORD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/sword-1.5.8-r2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=433723#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-02-21 01:00:46 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The Diatheke CGI allows arbitrary command execution in the context of  the webserver, e.g. www-data by simply abusing the range parameter.  For example, &range=`yes` will consume tons of resources on the affected  webserver. Escalation of privleges and command shells are left as an  exercise to the reader.

Package        : diatheke
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2008-0932
Debian Bug     : 466449

Dan Dennison discovered that Diatheke, a CGI program to make a bible
website, performs insufficient sanitising of a parameter, allowing a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands as the web server
user.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.9-2etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.7-7sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.9-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your diatheke package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](#c0)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:33:33 UTC  ``` Hello there.  All this is the result from some discussions with seemant about a package for GTK+ themes. Ultimately, this is my attempt to follow his suggestions.  Have a look at bugs #1921 and #1294 for more related info.  This is what I wrote: - 2 eclasses: gtk-engines and gtk-engines-basic - 13 gtk engines ebuilds: gtk-engines-* - A gtk themes ebuild: gtk-themes   Any comments will be deeply estimated. I just love the Portage model...  Thanks,  Leonardo ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:34:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 670](attachment.cgi?id=670 "gtk-engines.eclass") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=670&action=edit "gtk-engines.eclass")] gtk-engines.eclass ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:34:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 671](attachment.cgi?id=671 "gtk-engines-basic.eclass") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=671&action=edit "gtk-engines-basic.eclass")] gtk-engines-basic.eclass ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:34:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 672](attachment.cgi?id=672 "gtk-engines-begtk-1.0.1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=672&action=edit "gtk-engines-begtk-1.0.1.ebuild")] gtk-engines-begtk-1.0.1.ebuild ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:36:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 673](attachment.cgi?id=673 "gtk-engines-cleanice-0.8.5.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=673&action=edit "gtk-engines-cleanice-0.8.5.ebuild")] gtk-engines-cleanice-0.8.5.ebuild ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:37:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 674](attachment.cgi?id=674 "gtk-engines-eazel-0.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=674&action=edit "gtk-engines-eazel-0.3.ebuild")] gtk-engines-eazel-0.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:37:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 675](attachment.cgi?id=675 "gtk-engines-flat-0.1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=675&action=edit "gtk-engines-flat-0.1.ebuild")] gtk-engines-flat-0.1.ebuild ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:38:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 676](attachment.cgi?id=676 "gtk-engines-gtkstep-2.2.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=676&action=edit "gtk-engines-gtkstep-2.2.ebuild")] gtk-engines-gtkstep-2.2.ebuild ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:38:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 677](attachment.cgi?id=677 "gtk-engines-icegradient-0.0.5.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=677&action=edit "gtk-engines-icegradient-0.0.5.ebuild")] gtk-engines-icegradient-0.0.5.ebuild ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:38:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 678](attachment.cgi?id=678 "gtk-engines-metal-0.12.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=678&action=edit "gtk-engines-metal-0.12.ebuild")] gtk-engines-metal-0.12.ebuild ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:39:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 679](attachment.cgi?id=679 "gtk-engines-notif-0.12.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=679&action=edit "gtk-engines-notif-0.12.ebuild")] gtk-engines-notif-0.12.ebuild ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:39:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 680](attachment.cgi?id=680 "gtk-engines-pixmap-0.12.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=680&action=edit "gtk-engines-pixmap-0.12.ebuild")] gtk-engines-pixmap-0.12.ebuild ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:40:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 681](attachment.cgi?id=681 "gtk-engines-raleigh-0.12.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=681&action=edit "gtk-engines-raleigh-0.12.ebuild")] gtk-engines-raleigh-0.12.ebuild ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:40:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 682](attachment.cgi?id=682 "gtk-engines-redmond95-0.12.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=682&action=edit "gtk-engines-redmond95-0.12.ebuild")] gtk-engines-redmond95-0.12.ebuild ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:40:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 683](attachment.cgi?id=683 "gtk-engines-thinice-1.0.4.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=683&action=edit "gtk-engines-thinice-1.0.4.ebuild")] gtk-engines-thinice-1.0.4.ebuild ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:41:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684](attachment.cgi?id=684 "gtk-engines-xenophilia-0.7.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=684&action=edit "gtk-engines-xenophilia-0.7.ebuild")] gtk-engines-xenophilia-0.7.ebuild  Is this ever gonna stop? ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 17:42:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 685](attachment.cgi?id=685 "gtk-themes-0.1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=685&action=edit "gtk-themes-0.1.ebuild")] gtk-themes-0.1.ebuild  Ok, this was the last one ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-25 21:16:15 UTC  ``` The one thing I don't like about these ebuilds is the way they override the P variable, which really shouldn't be done. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Spider (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-26 06:11:59 UTC  ``` mm, how will we do with the gtk2 single engine thats in portage?

Yes, I agree. The thing is that all these packages (engines) do not unpack themselves into consistenly-named directories, so overriding $P (and sometimes $S) was my not-very-clean solution to the problem.  I guess I can come up with a better way to fix this inside the eclass, so ebuilds don't have to override those variables. I'll give it a try.   > mm, how will we do with the gtk2 single engine thats in portage? Right now there > will be some more coming up (gnome2-beta4 has a engines package in it) that will > give us some further engines, I guess I could just as well merge it into the others :)  Yeah, it's not much of a problem, anyway. I'd be more than pleased to see gnome2 released and to reconsider how to handle engines then.   > gtk-thinice-engine is my work in progress, its really stable and usable, only > masked because of the gtk+2 version globbing problems currently in portage.  Yes, I've seen it. Very nice what you're doing with Gtk 2, BTW. You can be sure that I'll be very interested in helping you with GTK/Gnome 2 stuff...  I'm dying to see gnome2 released!   > I do like the general idea here, good job.  Thanks. :)   > Should we call the themes (ie, .gtkrc's and so on) in groups of the engine they > depend on, or just globally glob them all together?  I'd say it should be a Good Thing to have them all together in a single ebuild.   Maybe there could be different theme ebuilds grouped by the engine they depend on, and then a single ebuild that installs them altogether via DEPENDS. I don't know, you're the ones who have the power. :)  ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-27 05:26:52 UTC  ``` Spider, any further thoughts on this?  Apologies for the delay Leonardo, we're just not sure at this point how to handle adding this into portage. ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Spider (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-27 10:05:06 UTC  ``` >Maybe there could be different theme ebuilds grouped by the engine they depend >on, and then a single ebuild that installs them altogether via DEPENDS. I don't >know, you're the ones who have the power. :)   I quite like this idea, then a big depend sort of ebuild.  What I'd also suggest is an x11-theme or the like cateogry for all such related things...   since we have a lot of things that are themeable we can fill one up nicely :) ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-28 10:42:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1195](attachment.cgi?id=1195 "collection of files (1 eclass, 15 ebuilds)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1195&action=edit "collection of files (1 eclass, 15 ebuilds)")] collection of files (1 eclass, 15 ebuilds)  (quick note -- this file is intended to be processed with something like:   cat portage-gtk-files | perl -e 'while(<STDIN>){if(/^=(.*)/){open(F,">$1")}else{print F}}' )   Hello,  These are my modifications to all the gtk-themes related files. Let's see, changes include:  * A new engine: mac2 * New version of the xenophilia engine: 0.8 * There's only one eclass now for all the engines ebuilds (there's no more gtk-engines-basic.eclass) * The gtk-engines-* ebuilds do not override variables like P, PN and S. Everything is handled inside the eclass. * The SRC_URI variable for the gtk-themes ebuild has been updated with freshmeat URLs.  I think that's all. A couple of additional notes:  * I'd suggest a new category too. x11-themes sounds quite good. * There's a couple of engines that are licensed under the Library General Public License V2 (you'll find about that on the eclass). I've noticed that there's the LGPL-2.1 in /usr/portage/licenses, but I'm not sure about what's the better thing to do here. Assign "LGPL-2.1" to the LICENSE of those packages or suggest a new license (the old LPGL-2) for its inclusion under the Portage licenses directory?  Thanks,  Leonardo ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-29 06:10:35 UTC  ``` Leonardo,  The last attachment is something I can't seem to see.  Can you attach a tarball of all the ebuilds plus the eclass please?  I'd like to add this to portage ASAP. Also, any ideas for GTK2 theemes?  I will be moving gtk-engines and gtk-thinice-engines into x11-themes momentarily. Let's throw some more in.  Spider,  are there any other pre-existing themes that need to be migrated into x11-themes? ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Spider (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-29 06:34:55 UTC  ``` crux is one for gtk2  thinice-engines is gtk2 thinice theme is gtk 1.2  ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Leonardo Boshell (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-07-02 07:38:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1914](attachment.cgi?id=1914 "gtk-stuff.tar.gz") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1914&action=edit "gtk-stuff.tar.gz")] gtk-stuff.tar.gz  Hi there,  This is my latest revision to all these gtk themes stuff. A lot of changes have been made again, hoping that this collection of ebuilds (plus the eclass) would fit into the portage tree nice and easy with very little or no modification at all.  First, let's sum up the contents of this tarball:  * The gtk-engines.eclass  * 21 ebuilds for several gtk-engines (which inherit from the eclass)   - 14 GTK1 engines   - 07 GTK2 engines  * 2 `gtk-themes' ebuilds, one for GTK1 themes, and one for GTK2 themes.   It should also be noted here that this collection of files include the work made by Spider, specifically with the following packages:  * crux * gtk-engines * gtk-thinice-engine * gtk-thinice-theme  and under the new model they have been relocated as follows:  * crux -> gtk-engines-crux (this is the gtk engine formerly known as gtk-engines-eazel in GTK1)  * gtk-engines -> this is a collection of 3 GTK2 engines, which exist now as gtk-engines-metal, gtk-engines-pixbuf (formerly known as gtk-engines-pixmap) and gtk-engines-redmond95  * gtk-thinice-engine -> gtk-engines-thinice (SLOT 2)  * gtk-thinice-theme -> gtk-engines-thinice (SLOT 1)   That's about it.  BTW, I'm very happy with the announcement of Gnome 2, and I expect to make the jump to the new version soon, it's just that I'm going through a stressful moment here at job and I don't want to take any risks while I wrap up some critical projects. But I can't wait to help with Gnome2-related development inside Gentoo as soon as I possibly can. :)  Thanks,  Leonardo ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Gabriele Giorgetti    2002-07-09 09:06:54 UTC  ``` Yay, Themes ! :)  ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: diatheke: Diatheke allows arbitrary command execution using the range
parameter
Date: Mon, 18 Feb 2008 15:35:20 -0500
```
Package: diatheke
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

The Diatheke CGI allows arbitrary command execution in the context of
the webserver, e.g. www-data by simply abusing the range parameter.

For example, &range=`yes` will consume tons of resources on the affected
webserver. Escalation of privleges and command shells are left as an
exercise to the reader.
