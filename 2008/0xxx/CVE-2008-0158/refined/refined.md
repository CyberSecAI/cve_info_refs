Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of Shop-Script 2.0. Specifically, the `aux_page` parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Disclosure (LFD):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose local files on the server by manipulating the `aux_page` parameter.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The use of `../../` sequences in the URL allows the attacker to navigate outside the intended directory and access sensitive files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and other sensitive information. This can lead to further compromise of the system, such as gaining access to databases, other web applications, or even the underlying operating system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` that includes the malicious `aux_page` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Knowledge of the Target Path:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) paths to sensitive files on the system.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided content includes the following exploit example:

```
http://site.com/Script/index.php?aux_page=../../../../../etc/passwd
```

This URL demonstrates how an attacker can read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Linux system.
