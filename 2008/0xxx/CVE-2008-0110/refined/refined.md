  "CVE-2008-0110": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Microsoft Outlook does not perform sufficient validation of mailto URIs passed to the Outlook client.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate checking of parameters passed to the Outlook email client when interpreting a mailto URI. This allows for code execution by altering the way Outlook is invoked.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted mailto URI can be delivered via a malicious HTML email message or from a webpage controlled by the attacker. The user must click on the malicious mailto link to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious mailto URI and convince the user to click on it, either via a link in an email or on a webpage."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Outlook handles mailto URIs.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of mailto URIs passed to the Outlook client.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. An attacker can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted mailto URI",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to convince a user to click on a specially crafted mailto URI, typically through a link in an email or on a website."
