- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the `songinfo.php` script
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, access sensitive data like usernames and passwords from the database, and potentially gain control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `songid` parameter of the `songinfo.php` script via HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs no prior authentication.
