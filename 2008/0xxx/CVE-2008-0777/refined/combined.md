How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:03.sendfile Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: sendfile(2) write-only file permission bypass
Category: core
Module: sys\_kern
Announced: 2008-02-14
Credits: Kostik Belousov
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected: 2008-02-14 11:45:00 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.0-PRERELEASE)
2008-02-14 11:45:41 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE)
2008-02-14 11:46:08 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.3-STABLE)

2008-02-14 11:47:39 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p23)
2008-02-14 11:49:39 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2008-02-14 11:50:28 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p19)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-0777
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The sendfile(2) system call allows a server application (such as a
HTTP or FTP server) to transmit the contents of a file over a network
connection without first copying it to application memory. High
performance servers such as the Apache HTTP Server and ftpd use sendfile.
II. Problem Description
When a process opens a file (and other file system objects, such as
directories), it specifies access flags indicating its intent to read,
write, or perform other operations. These flags are checked against
file system permissions, and then stored in the resulting file
descriptor to validate future operations against.
The sendfile(2) system call does not check the file descriptor access
flags before sending data from a file.
III. Impact
If a file is write-only, a user process can open the file and use
sendfile to send the content of the file over a socket, even though the
user does not have read access to the file, resulting in possible
disclosure of sensitive information.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems are only vulnerable if
write-only files exist, which are not widely used.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, 6-STABLE, or
7.0-PRERELEASE, or to the RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_3, RELENG\_6\_2,
RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the correction
date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
6.2, 6.3, and 7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 6.2, 6.3, and 7.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:03/sendfile.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:03/sendfile.patch.asc

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:03/sendfile55.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:03/sendfile55.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
