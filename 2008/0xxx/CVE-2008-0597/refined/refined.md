  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of IPP packets related to adding and removing remote printers, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free vulnerability in the processing of crafted IPP packets."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP IPP packets to the CUPS daemon, causing it to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted UDP IPP packets to the CUPS daemon.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server's CUPS service (typically port 631)."
