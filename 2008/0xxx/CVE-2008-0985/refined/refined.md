{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Android's core libraries for processing graphic content. Specifically, issues were found in the handling of GIF, PNG, and BMP image formats.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow in GIF parsing: The `GIFImageDecoder::onDecode()` function allocates a heap buffer based on the Logical Screen Width and Height fields of the GIF header, but the buffer is filled with data based on the actual image width and height. This discrepancy leads to a heap overflow.",
      "Use of outdated libpng library: The Android SDK used an old version of the libpng library (1.2.7 or 1.2.8), which is vulnerable to multiple known vulnerabilities (CVE-2006-5793, CVE-2007-2445, CVE-2007-5267, CVE-2007-5266, CVE-2007-5268, CVE-2007-5269).",
      "Integer overflow in BMP parsing: A negative offset in the BMP header, combined with an 8-bit per pixel image, leads to an integer overflow when calculating the palette size. This allows overwriting arbitrary memory locations with a fixed value.",
       "Uninitialized variable: The code uses an uninitialized variable in calculations related to the palette size during BMP processing, which can further contribute to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Android system. A malicious website hosting specially crafted content could be used to launch client-side attacks through the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious website: By hosting specially crafted GIF, PNG, or BMP image files, an attacker can trigger vulnerabilities when a victim's Android browser attempts to process these files.",
       "Client-side attacks: The vulnerabilities can be exploited through the Android browser by loading a malicious webpage containing specially crafted images."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or otherwise deliver malicious image files to the victim's device through the browser. Knowledge of binary exploitation and heap manipulation techniques is required to leverage the vulnerabilities for arbitrary code execution.  The attacker needs to create a specially crafted image, including GIF, PNG or BMP, to trigger the vulnerabilities."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Android SDK m3-rc37a and earlier",
    "Android SDK m5-rc14 (BMP vulnerability only)"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "Android SDK m5-rc15"
  ],
   "additional_notes": "The advisory also notes that while Android applications run with the credentials of an unprivileged user, the version of the SDK that was vulnerable shipped with a passwordless root account, exacerbating the impact of successful exploits."
