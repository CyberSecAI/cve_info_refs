Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0458

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `newlang` parameter within the SLAED CMS 2.5 Lite application. The `get_lang()` function in `function/sources.php` directly uses the `$_REQUEST['newlang']` parameter to construct a file path for inclusion without validating or filtering the input.
*   **Weakness:**  Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application is vulnerable to LFI due to the insecure handling of the `newlang` parameter. An attacker can manipulate this parameter to include arbitrary files from the server.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other system files. In the provided exploit example, the attacker can read `/etc/passwd`, which could expose system user information.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attack vector is through a web request to the `index.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `newlang` parameter within the URL.
    *   The vulnerable code resides within the `get_lang()` function in `function/sources.php` and called by `index.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server.
    *   No prior authentication is required.
    *   The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be turned off in the PHP configuration.
*   **Exploit:**
    *   The attacker provides a crafted URL containing the `newlang` parameter with a path to a file on the server, using directory traversal (`..`) and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass any potential file extension check (if present).
    *   Example exploit URL: `http://[targethost]/[path]/index.php?newlang=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit-db entry provides the vulnerable code snippet from `function/sources.php`, showing the flawed `require_once` statement.
*   It also notes that the `newlang` variable is not filtered.
*   The exploit requires magic quotes to be disabled.
