Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2008-0217:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `openpty(3)` function in FreeBSD, when called by a non-root user, creates a pseudo-terminal that is world-readable and writable. Although this behavior is documented, the `script(1)` utility uses `openpty(3)` and can be used by non-root users, leading to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure default permissions on pseudo-terminals created by non-root users.
- `script(1)` utility's reliance on the vulnerable `openpty(3)` function
- The creation of pseudo terminals with world readable and writable permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can snoop on the text printed to a user's terminal if the user is running `script(1)` or another application using `openpty(3)`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a non-root user running `script(1)` or other programs using `openpty(3)`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker does not need root privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to run script(1) or other applications using `openpty(3)` while another user is using a terminal.

The provided content gives more detail than a standard CVE description, it specifies vulnerable functions (`openpty(3)`), affected programs (`script(1)`), and the specific impact (terminal snooping). It also notes that the user being snooped on may notice the attack in many cases since the text will not be shown on their terminal.
