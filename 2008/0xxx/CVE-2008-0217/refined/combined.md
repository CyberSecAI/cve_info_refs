How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:01.pty Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: pty snooping
Category: core
Module: libc\_stdlib / libutil
Announced: 2008-01-14
Credits: John Baldwin
Affects: FreeBSD 5.0 and later.
Corrected: 2008-01-14 22:57:45 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.0-PRERELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:55:54 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RC2)
2008-01-14 22:56:05 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.3-PRERELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:56:18 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:56:44 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p10)
2008-01-14 22:56:56 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p22)
2008-01-14 22:57:06 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2008-01-14 22:57:19 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p18)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-0216, CVE-2008-0217
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
pt\_chown is a setuid root support utility used by grantpt(3) to change
ownership of a tty.
openpty(3) is a support function in libutil which is used to obtain a
pseudo-terminal.
script(1) is a utility which makes a typescript of everything printed
on a terminal.
II. Problem Description
Two issues exist in the FreeBSD pty handling.
If openpty(3) is called as non-root user the newly created
pseudo-terminal is world readable and writeable. While this is
documented to be the case, script(1) still uses openpty(3) and
script(1) may be used by non-root users [CVE-2008-0217].
The ptsname(3) function incorrectly extracts two characters from the
name of a device node in /dev without verifying that it's actually
operating on a valid pty which the calling user owns. pt\_chown uses
the bad result from ptsname(3) to change ownership of a pty to the
user calling pt\_chown [CVE-2008-0216].
III. Impact
If an unprivileged user is running script(1), or another program which
uses openpty(3), an attacker may snoop text which is printed to the
users terminal.
If a malicious user has read access to a device node with characters
in the device name that match the name of a pty, then the malicious user
can read the content of the pty from another user. The malicious user
can open a lot of tty's resulting in a high probabilty of a new user
obtaining the pty name of a "vulnerable" pty.
NOTE WELL: If a user snoops a pty the snooped text will not be shown
to the real user, which in many cases mean the real owner of the pty
will be able to know the attack is taking place.
IV. Workaround
Do not run script(1) as a non-root user.
The ptsname(3) issue only affects FreeBSD 6.0 and newer.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, 6-STABLE, or
7.0-PRERELEASE, or to the RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_3, RELENG\_6\_2,
RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the correction
date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
6.2, 6.3, and 7.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 5.5]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:01/pty5.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:01/pty5.patch.asc

# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:01/pty7.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:01/pty7.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system as described in
 and reboot the
system.
