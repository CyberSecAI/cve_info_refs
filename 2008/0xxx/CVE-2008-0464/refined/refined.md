{
  "CVE-2008-0464": {
    "Description": "Aconon Mail is vulnerable to directory traversal. The 'template' parameter in the archiv.cgi script is not properly sanitized against directory traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the path.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'template' parameter within the archiv.cgi script. Specifically, the script does not prevent directory traversal characters (../) from being used.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver user has access to, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files, source code, or password files.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the `archiv.cgi` script. By manipulating the `template` parameter to include directory traversal sequences such as `../`, an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `archiv.cgi` script. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
