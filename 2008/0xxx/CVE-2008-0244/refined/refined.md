  "CVE-2008-0244": {
    "description": "SAP MaxDB 7.6.03 build 007 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via \"&&\" and other shell metacharacters in exec_sdbinfo and other unspecified commands, which are executed when MaxDB invokes cons.exe.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The MaxDB server executes \"cons.exe DATABASE COMMAND\" using system() when certain commands are called. The `system()` function allows the execution of shell commands. Input validation is insufficient.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
        "Use of system() with unsanitized input"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution leading to complete compromise of the server, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access",
        "Sending crafted SAP MaxDB commands containing shell metacharacters"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the malicious requests, requiring no special privileges or prior access.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when calling commands like 'exec_sdbinfo' without authentication and injecting shell metacharacters (e.g., '&&') to execute arbitrary commands. This issue affects Windows, Linux and Solaris."
