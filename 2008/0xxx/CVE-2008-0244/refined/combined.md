===============
1) Introduction
===============

SAP MaxDB is a commercial and widely known and used database.

#######################################################################

======
2) Bug
======

The MaxDB server executes "cons.exe DATABASE COMMAND" through system()
when some special commands are called by the user.
Some of these special commands are "show" and "exec_sdbinfo" and this
last one is just one of the small amount of commands which can be
executed by the unauthenticated users before logging in.

The usage of system() for executing the cons program allows an external
unauthenticated attacker to execute any command he wants on the target
SAP MaxDB server simply passing the "&&" or other patterns for the
execution of multiple commands in the shell.

So it's just enough to use the following SAP command to see the content
of C: on Windows (the bug is naturally exploitable on any other
platform supported by the server):

  exec_sdbinfo && echo dir c:\ | cmd.exe

Then the rest and all the other possibilities of exploiting this
vulnerability are in the fantasy of the attacker...

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
SAP MaxDB is a commercial and widely known and used database.
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
The MaxDB server executes "cons.exe DATABASE COMMAND" through system()
when some special commands are called by the user.
Some of these special commands are "show" and "exec\_sdbinfo" and this
last one is just one of the small amount of commands which can be
executed by the unauthenticated users before logging in.
The usage of system() for executing the cons program allows an external
unauthenticated attacker to execute any command he wants on the target
SAP MaxDB server simply passing the "&&" or other patterns for the
execution of multiple commands in the shell.
So it's just enough to use the following SAP command to see the content
of C: on Windows (the bug is naturally exploitable on any other
platform supported by the server):
exec\_sdbinfo && echo dir c:\ | cmd.exe
Then the rest and all the other possibilities of exploiting this
vulnerability are in the fantasy of the attacker...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Versions: <= 7.6.03 build 007
Platforms: Windows, Linux and Solaris
Bug: pre-auth remote commands execution

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
SAP MaxDB is a commercial and widely known and used database.
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
The MaxDB server executes "cons.exe DATABASE COMMAND" through system()
when some special commands are called by the user.
Some of these special commands are "show" and "exec\_sdbinfo" and this
last one is just one of the small amount of commands which can be
executed by the unauthenticated users before logging in.
The usage of system() for executing the cons program allows an external
unauthenticated attacker to execute any command he wants on the target
SAP MaxDB server simply passing the "&&" or other patterns for the
execution of multiple commands in the shell.
So it's just enough to use the following SAP command to see the content
of C: on Windows (the bug is naturally exploitable on any other
platform supported by the server):
exec\_sdbinfo && echo dir c:\ | cmd.exe
Then the rest and all the other possibilities of exploiting this
vulnerability are in the fantasy of the attacker...

Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage. A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `"cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox"`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-48919/ "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI.

Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts.") |

A potential vulnerability has been identified in the input validation process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. This issue could allow an attacker to submit malicious input data, bypassing input validation, resulting in remote code execution in certain machine learning applications using the ACON library. All users utilizing ACON�??s input-handling functions are potentially at risk. Specifically, machine learning models or applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable. Users running ACON on production servers are at heightened risk, as the vulnerability could be exploited remotely. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-49361/ "ACON is a widely-used library of tools for machine learning that focuses on adaptive correlation optimization.
