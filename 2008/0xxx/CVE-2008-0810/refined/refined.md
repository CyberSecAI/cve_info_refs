Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-0810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `com_scheduling` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the `com_scheduling` component when handling the `id` parameter in the `viewAbstract` action. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Bypass authentication
- Extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in a request to `index.php` with the `com_scheduling` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code into the `id` parameter:
`index.php?option=com_scheduling&Itemid=28&action=viewAbstract&id=-999999 union select 0,1,concat(username,0x3a,password),concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 from mos_users`

This specific exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
- The exploit has been assigned a CVSS Base Score of 7.5/10, with high exploitability (10/10) due to the low complexity and the fact no authentication is needed
- The exploit is remotely exploitable.
- Dorks: `inurl: com_scheduling` and `allinurl: com_scheduling` can help identify vulnerable instances.
