      "cve": "CVE-2008-0238",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "xine-lib has a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the RTSP header-handling code.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient boundary checks in the `rmff_dump_cont()` function of `input/libreal/rmff.c` when processing SDP attributes such as 'Title', 'Author', 'Copyright', and 'Abstract'. Additionally, insufficient buffer size checks were present in RTSP header processing within xine-lib.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Heap-based buffer overflow",
          "Insufficient boundary checks",
          "Integer overflow"
        ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application, or cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Tricking a user into opening a malicious RTSP stream",
          "Opening a crafted FLAC, FLV, MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file",
          "Opening a specially crafted Speex file",
        "Opening a crafted ASF or NSF file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RTSP stream, or a crafted media file to be opened by a user running an application that uses xine-lib.",
       "affected_components": [
        "SDP Parser",
        "RTSP Header handling",
         "FLAC Tag validation",
         "ASF demuxer",
         "Matroska demuxer",
          "Speex file header processing",
        "NSF file processing",
          "Multiple integer overflows in multiple file formats."

      ],
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `rmff_dump_cont()` function which is used when processing SDP attributes. The vulnerability is also present when processing RTSP headers. Multiple integer overflows were discovered when processing FLV, MOV, RM, MVE, MKV, or CAK files.  A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered when processing NSF files. Various input validation issues were identified when processing Speex files."
