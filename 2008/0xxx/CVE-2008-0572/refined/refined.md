```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths within `require_once` statements, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). Specifically, the `MM_GLOBALS['home']` variable, which can be manipulated via HTTP GET parameters, is used to specify the base directory of included files.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability: Multiple files in the application are vulnerable to RFI. This is due to the use of `require_once` with user-controlled input in the file path.
  - Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize or validate the `MM_GLOBALS['home']` parameter before using it in file inclusion statements.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Remote code execution: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server by controlling the `MM_GLOBALS['home']` parameter, allowing for complete compromise of the server.

- Attack vectors:
  - HTTP GET requests: Attackers can inject malicious code by crafting HTTP GET requests to vulnerable files, setting the `MM_GLOBALS['home']` parameter to a URL pointing to attacker-controlled PHP code.
  - Network-based attacks: The attack can be launched from any network location capable of sending HTTP requests to the target server.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Network access: The attacker needs network connectivity to send HTTP requests to the target server.
  - PHP knowledge: The attacker needs a basic understanding of PHP and how to host malicious PHP code on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.
