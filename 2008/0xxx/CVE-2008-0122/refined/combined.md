| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-17 16:46:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-0122:  Off-by-one error in the inet_network function in libc in FreeBSD 6.2, 6.3, and 7.0-PRERELEASE and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted input that triggers memory corruption.   Affected code is also used by ISC Bind library, which is affected by this problem too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c4)  Adam Tkac    2008-01-17 16:47:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 292030](attachment.cgi?id=292030&action=diff "patch for this issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=292030&action=edit "patch for this issue") patch for this issue   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-18 16:58:04 UTC  ``` Issue is already public for libbind:  <http://marc.info/?l=bind-announce&m=120067515802939&w=2>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-18 17:05:06 UTC  ``` GNU libc implementation seems to be based on the very same BSD code used by FreeBSD and ISC Bind, but has this change applied in all versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the oldest version is 2.2.4).   From inet/inet_net.c:          if (!digit)                 return (INADDR_NONE);         if (pp >= parts + 4 || val > 0xff)                 return (INADDR_NONE);         if (*cp == '.') {                 *pp++ = val, cp++;                 goto again;         }    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-21 11:42:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of GNU libc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, or 5.  This issue affects the versions of libbind as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5, however the vulnerable function is not used by any shipped applications.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has therefore rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0122>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-22 16:01:27 UTC  ``` bind-9.4.2-3.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-27 11:07:29 UTC  ``` This problem allows an attacker to write 1 unsigned long int value (4 or 8 bytes, depending on the platform used) beyond the end of the buffer.  This overwrite is too short to modify function return address, so this problem does not seem to be easily exploitable or verifiable using reproducer.    ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c15)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 16:11:22 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0300)   ``` |  |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sarg buffer overflow
The SQUID logfile analyzer sarg was updated to fix a buffer overflow
that can occur while handling untrusted log data. (CVE-2008-1167)
sarg was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- phpMyAdmin multiple XSS problems
phpMyAdmin was updated to fix multiple cross-site-scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-6100, CVE-2007-5589).
phpMyAdmin was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- xine FLAC security issues
The multimedia framework xine was updated to fix a possible buffer
overflow that can be triggered via FLAC tags to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-0486) and a possible buffer overflow in the matroska
demuxer (CVE-2008-1161).
All Xine versions on our products have been updated.
- bind 1 byte overflow
Certain input data could trigger a buffer overflow in the
'inet\_network' function of libbind.
Applications that use this function could therefore potentially be
crashed or exploited to execute arbitrary code.
The Bind server itself is not affected (CVE-2008-0122).
- dbus-1 policy application problem
The message bus dbus-1 was updated to fix a vulnerability caused by
applying the policies incorrectly. (CVE-2008-0595)
dbus-1 was updated on all distributions.
- silc-toolkit buffer overflow
silc-toolkit was updated to fix a stack-based buffer overflow in
the silc\_fingerprint() function which can possibly be exploited to
execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2008-1227)
silc-toolkit is included only in openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- boost regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could cause the boost library to crash
(CVE-2008-0171, CVE-2008-0172).
boost was updated for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1,
and openSUSE 10.2, 10.3. Older products are not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## inet\_network() off-by-one buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#203611

Original Release Date: 2008-01-25 | Last Revised: 2008-04-28

---

### Overview

The inet\_network() resolver function contains an off-by-one buffer overflow, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The inet\_network() function takes a character string representation for an internet address and returns the internet network number in integer form. inet\_network() is implemented by various libbind, libc, and [GNU libc](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) versions. Applications that link against a vulnerable version of inet\_network() may be vulnerable to a one-byte overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  **FreeBSD libc** - Apply the patch in FreeBSD Security Advisory [FreeBSD-SA-08:02.libc](http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-08%3A02.libc.asc)**GNU libc** - This issue was resolved on February 11, 2000 in the main ([diff](http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/inet/inet_net.c.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.9&cvsroot=glibc&f=h)) and glibc 2.1 ([diff](http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/inet/inet_net.c.diff?r1=1.6.2.1&r2=1.6.2.2&cvsroot=glibc&f=h)) branches**libbind** - This issue will be resolved in libbind 9.3.5, 9.4.3, 2.5.0b2, or later. A patch is also available in the ISC [Advisory](http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/bind-security.php) |

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-08:02.libc Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: inet\_network() buffer overflow
Category: core
Module: libc
Announced: 2008-01-14
Credits: Bjoern A. Zeeb and Nate Eldredge
Affects: FreeBSD 6.2
Corrected: 2008-01-14 22:57:45 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.0-PRERELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:55:54 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RC2)
2008-01-14 22:56:05 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.3-PRERELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:56:18 UTC (RELENG\_6\_3, 6.3-RELEASE)
2008-01-14 22:56:44 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p10)
CVE Name: CVE-2008-0122
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The resolver is the part of libc that resolves hostnames (example.com) to
internet protocol (IP) addresses (192.0.2.1) and vice versa.
The inet\_network() function returns an in\_addr\_t representing the network
address of the IP address given to inet\_network() as a character string in
the dot-notation.
II. Problem Description
An off-by-one error in the inet\_network() function could lead to memory
corruption with certain inputs.
III. Impact
For programs which passes untrusted data to inet\_network(), an
attacker may be able to overwrite a region of memory with user defined
data by causing specially crafted input to be passed to
inet\_network().
Depending on the region of memory the attacker is able to overwrite,
this might lead to a denial of service or potentially code execution
in the program using inet\_network().
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7.0-PRERELEASE, or 6-STABLE, or
to the, RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_3, or RELENG\_6\_2 security branch dated
after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.0, 6.3,
or 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:02/libc.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-08:02/libc.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-17 16:46:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2008-0122:  Off-by-one error in the inet_network function in libc in FreeBSD 6.2, 6.3, and 7.0-PRERELEASE and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted input that triggers memory corruption.   Affected code is also used by ISC Bind library, which is affected by this problem too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c4)  Adam Tkac    2008-01-17 16:47:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 292030](attachment.cgi?id=292030&action=diff "patch for this issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=292030&action=edit "patch for this issue") patch for this issue   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-18 16:58:04 UTC  ``` Issue is already public for libbind:  <http://marc.info/?l=bind-announce&m=120067515802939&w=2>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-18 17:05:06 UTC  ``` GNU libc implementation seems to be based on the very same BSD code used by FreeBSD and ISC Bind, but has this change applied in all versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the oldest version is 2.2.4).   From inet/inet_net.c:          if (!digit)                 return (INADDR_NONE);         if (pp >= parts + 4 || val > 0xff)                 return (INADDR_NONE);         if (*cp == '.') {                 *pp++ = val, cp++;                 goto again;         }    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-01-21 11:42:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of GNU libc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, or 5.  This issue affects the versions of libbind as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5, however the vulnerable function is not used by any shipped applications.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has therefore rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0122>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-22 16:01:27 UTC  ``` bind-9.4.2-3.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-27 11:07:29 UTC  ``` This problem allows an attacker to write 1 unsigned long int value (4 or 8 bytes, depending on the platform used) beyond the end of the buffer.  This overwrite is too short to modify function return address, so this problem does not seem to be easily exploitable or verifiable using reproducer.    ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=429149#c15)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-23 16:11:22 UTC  ``` This was addressed via:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHSA-2008:0300)   ``` |  |
