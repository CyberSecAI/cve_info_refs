## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

take a look at two enclosed attachments. one whows IE HTTP Auth prompt, one
shows Firefox HTTP Auth prompt.
guess which of these is nicer and more user friendly.
shouldn't we also have something more nice, when we have IMHO the best browser
artwork on the market?
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
use everything that requires HTTP authentication and see the prompt.
Actual Results:
the prompt is ugly.
Expected Results:
the prompt should be much more nice, as the IE's prompt is.

Why "Firefox needs your keys to unlock this door" if the keys icon seems odd to you? Anyways, I like the metaphor.

Well, keys is my (a user) part that i've got, lock is Firefox's one. It shows me that the page is locked and i need to "give/use my keys". I'd prefer keys icon for username(nickname)/password part in some registration form :)

So, I'm probably going to poke at this bug in the process of fixing [bug 227632](/show_bug.cgi?id=227632 "NEW - Allow user to select among multiple saved logins in HTTP Basic and Digest Auth dialogs")...
I'm not sure we really want to add much bling to the prompt; I think the graphics in the IE prompt are are too strong, and overwhelm / clash with the simplicity of the prompt's content. For OS X, I think we're mostly in good shape with the platform's style.
Still, some minor tweaks would clean things up...
\* Reformat the dialog text so it's not just one giant string
- Make it easier to identify the server the auth is for
- break the HTTP realm string out of the flow
- Drop protocol aka locationbar2 / Safari prompt? [For HTTP only, and HTTPS with extra "submitting securely" blurb?
\* Text box labels on same line as textbox
The little icon for Windows does look kind of ugly, and some subtle graphics might be a nice touch, but I'm not sure what to do while staying inside platform conventions.Whiteboard: [passwordManager-ui]

The URL requesting the login is essential. Without it, image servers and
other ancillary servers can fool the user into giving out his password for
the main site.

Note to self: also trim the max length of the realm string to prevent people from filling up the dialog with garbage, and squishing the buttons off-window or somesuch.

Please keep in mind embedders. the current API sucks.
as for pictures, you can see the results of various clients by canceling the auth prompt for <http://timeless.justdave.net/maemo/realm/realm.cgi>
Note that in the case of http auth, I really don't think we need to use a dialog at all and would rather we used a panel akin to the remember password panel or simply a web page. <http://viper.haque.net/~timeless/blog/8/>
the reason we need dialogs is when there's a sync call that can't be unwound, however http auth is a proxied call from another thread and as such it should be possible to arrange it so that it can wait forever.
IMO, a web page is ideal, keep in mind that an auth dialog is no more or less safe than a prompt from the web page (and practically speaking the content is suggested by the web page, so it really shouldn't be considered "trustworthy"), it's going to the same place over the same channel. If you do use a web page, then we could recycle the web page for nested content (such as images).
The only sucky case is <http://timeless.justdave.net/maemo/realm/picture.html> where there's no visual placeholder. Personally, for this case, I'd go with blocking those loads until the user opens the media tab of page info and selects the images. the media preview could then show the auth request and if the user happens to authenticate, the image can load. If someone really wanted to, they could create an info bar to tell the user that there are pending requests in the media tab.
---
If you're going to stick with the current bad design, the following things are probably requirements:
1. clearly distinguish the different auth cases (proxy, realm, other)
2. stick the labels on the same lines as the values
3. make sure that all values are scrollable, selectable, and copyable
4. use a different face/weight for labels than values
Note that text claiming that you must log in is false. Just because there's an auth prompt doesn't mean the only content available is the content reachable by entering values into the prompt.
Ideally there should be a way to temporarily view the alternate content (401 prompts include alternate content for the failure case) without dismissing the auth dialog, perhaps what the user wants to see isn't really protected, in which case, if the user sees that, the user can then choose to dismiss the dialog.
I think we should probably use "remember these credentials" (or something similar) instead of "remember my password". Especially when we're going to remember more than one set of credentials. (Opera 9 simply uses "remember password" which unlike the other variants is not \*wrong\*.)
Personally, I'd like to be able to get help for these dialogs, they're confusing, there's enough context and questions available that IMO help should be provided, however at a glance, only IE and MicroB (and its Opera predecessor, but not desktop Opera) include help. (Among the things to explain is how to delete credentials once you've remembered them - it won't be intuitive.)
dolske: please keep in mind that there might be a port floating around.
Also, what happens if i load feed:<http://timeless.justdave.net/maemo/realm/realm.cgi>
Nelson: I'm confused, assume we have the server and the realm, and we follow redirects, so the host is gmail.com and the image request is from g.mail.com, will the user really be able to recognize the difference? again, I'd rather not use dialogs. If you're worried about differing servers, I think we need some way to help the user recognize that the servers are different.URL: [http://timeless.justdave.net/maemo/re...](http://timeless.justdave.net/maemo/realm/realm.cgi)

> iCab seems to have the best UI to prevent this:
Yes, clearly distinguishing between the server and the realm is clearly a better design than just giving the realm without any label. iCab's lack of a scrollbar for long realms is unfriendly to sites that use long realm values (I've seen legal "This site is only for the use of..." messages stuck in there before), though. And yeah, there definitely needs to be a Help button so users can find out what the heck a realm is.
I think the idea of changing the dialog into a "panel" that's connected to the originating window is a great idea for security. And conversely, making it into a standard web page would be a terrible idea, IMHO. I don't want to have to constantly be clicking on a "Trust ?" button to see whether login requests are real or spoofed.
I think it's very important to render the panel in a form that's impossible for a website to render (in the absence of browser bugs). For instance, it could overlap the status bar yet be without the chrome of a normal browser popup window that would be capable of doing that.

Can this bug be used to make the authentication prompt not so jarring and modal? What's particularly bad about it for me is that I often open a couple tabs at once and log into the various sites. One of them uses an HTTP auth. prompt, and as soon as it loads in a background tab it steals focus, interrupting my typing, and demands attention.
The new "remember password" dialog was a gigantic improvement on the old one - perhaps something like that for this?

Labeling the field "realm" helps mitigate the spoofing threat, but that iCab dialog is really a textbook example of needlessly exposing the implementation model. At least it starts with a human readable message as opposed to saying "401," and the button is labeled OK instead of GET.
>there definitely needs to be a Help button so users

Exposing the implementation model to the user and then requiring them to read documentation to make informed decisions isn't all that user centric. If we are going to say "typically a description of the computer or system being accessed" in help, then let's just label it "description:"
Overall I'm leaning towards a content area message for the following reasons:
-tab specific
-non modal
-very clear who is producing the message since the location bar is visible
-site button is accessible for additional identity information
-consistent with the way you usually log in to web sites, in the content area
-clear that you are giving this information to a particular site, and not just Firefox (that 64x64 Firefox icon in the dialog is really messing up the cues for who is addressing the user).
Johnath should weigh in on this since he is our security UI guru.

So, I think discussion of more radical changes to the authentication prompt should be spun off to another bug(s), and limit the scope of this bug to the incremental changes that can be made in the Firefox 3 timeframe. I suspect major UI changes will require significant plumbing changes, and it's kind of late for that now.
I've opened [bug 411085](/show_bug.cgi?id=411085 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - overhaul HTTP authentication prompting") for discussion of such future UI.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=244273&attachment=295731)

This juggles the prompt contents around a bit, to make the input fields more compact and handle realms better... Long realms are truncated, and are shown at the end of the message to help avoid some forms of spoofing.
The existing implementation is hobbled by its use of nsIPrompt's PromptUsernameAndPassword(), which is... oh. I thought it was frozen, but it's not (neither is nsIAuthPrompt). However, I think from previous discussions there was reluctance to change those interfaces.
If we want to change the format of the dialog more, we'll either need to add/change interfaces to allow passing more than 1 message string, or have the nsIPrompt implementation parse things out of the string. The latter is obviously kind of messy, and carries a risk of the parser being tricked into putting things where it shouldn't.

the bigger problem is that nothing in content area can't be trusted.
suppose you fix this auth stuff.
via CSS (probably XUL) it is possible to make something that looks \*almost exactly like http auth dialog\* (the simplest case is to take a screenshoot, set it as a background of pseudo popup, put 2 styled inputs, show the pseudo dialog)

unexpected dialog asks luser's password and the luser handles it.
does it matter if the dialog is the real auth dialog or some CSS perversion - clearly no imo.

As schrep says, this obviously doesn't fix password spoofing in content, but basic housekeeping suggests that we not allow arbitrarily long strings to break our dialogs, if nothing else.

Dolske, if it's undesirable to tinker with commonDialog's structure here, what do you think about styling these fields to use -moz-pre-wrap, and then using these strings to break up the text, to pick up some of the spirit of comments like [comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=244273#c28 "RESOLVED FIXED - improve current HTTP authentication prompt")? Maybe
EnterUserPasswordForRealm=A username and password is being requested by %2$S.\n\nThe site says: "%1$S"
... or structure to that effect? I do agree that the localizer note should, if not specify location, at least make it clear that, in direct opposition to the normal approach, these strings should NOT be neatly integrated into the sentence structure, we want them to stand out as being something the site is saying, not firefox. I know you're not at review stage yet, but I suspect we'll also need to rev the entities here?

Looking at your screencap, 250 still looks pretty long. I don't have justification for any specific, smaller number, but I wouldn't personally object to, say, 150.
And at some point, you might get the ellipsis police ([bug 255051](/show_bug.cgi?id=255051 "NEW - Fix misuse of ellipsis throughout Fx")) after you, too. :)

Hrmm, perhaps, but that means we'd have to do more filtering on %1 to keep sites from abusing the -moz-pre-wrap (coalescing white-space, stripping new lines, etc). I'm leery about doing that.

I'm not how to fix this properly in code (see [bug 407481](/show_bug.cgi?id=407481 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unicode ellipsis to be used in code as well")). Since the "..." shouldn't normally be shown, I'm sorta inclined to leave it as is. The other option would be to to duplicate these strings, and have one for "blahblah %1$S" and "blahblah %1$S...".

Patch v.2 for review
I like the look of the inlining fields with labels, and the shorter truncation length. "The site says:..." feels a little awkward, but I think it conveys the necessary message, that what follows is a claim of the content.
The code changes look good to me, but I'm not technically a peer here. :) Why did you remove the comment blocks in commonDialog.xul? They aren't exactly wordy, but they do provide at-a-glance structure, and match the rest of the file, don't they?

Inlining the fields with the labels is a problem for the prompt() function, because its label is blank (it only populates the description).

How about positioning the textboxes under the icon, but with a min-width for the username/password column so that an empty prompt will line up with the description. (I'm not sure we should make the description line up with the textfields in the username/password case.)
You can see various examples of what I've been trying here:

Updated to change layout, as noted in previous comments.
Also slight grammar change: "A username and password are being requested" instead of "...is being requested". I think that's right?
The XUL/CSS probably still needs a bit of tweaking, as the dialog seems to have become a bit wider than it was before. Maybe it's just the old width + the new <column>? I should also probably make sure things don't fall apart with a long realm/host without any whitespace.

I think as long as it's just on two sequential lines, it's not a big deal and the #define just makes things murkier.

Hmm. I don't really understand why, but I suppose it's useful in another way as it allows formatted prompts. EG: javascript:confirm("orly?\n\nyarly") Since this is shared dialog code, we probably shouldn't break that case.
So, I've put the -moz-pre-wrap back in, but that means untrusted content can still make enormous dialogs by embedding newlines. [EG, a http realm with newlines, or simply alert("\n\n\n\n")]
Perhaps a simple general-purpose solution would be to add "overflow: -moz-scrollbars-vertical;" so that large content gets scrollbars? I tried experimenting with this, but I can't seem to get it to work right. :-(

Ahh. [Bug 115997](/show_bug.cgi?id=115997 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - alert()/confirm()/prompt() containing too much text is larger than the screen") covers the problem of giant dialogs due to excessive text (by adding scrollable areas). Since that's an annoyance but not a spoofing concern, let's go ahead and wrap up this bug as-is. 115997 can fix the annoyance.

That looks great, just small nits on the localization note:
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (EnterLoginForRealm, EnterLoginForProxy):
# %1 is an untrusted string provided by a remote server. It
# could try to take advantage of sentence structure in order to mislead the
# user (see [bug 244273](/show_bug.cgi?id=244273 "RESOLVED FIXED - improve current HTTP authentication prompt")). %1 should be integrated into the translated
# sentences as little as possible.
# %2 is the ... domain/url?
That's stricter on the format, and a few less "it"s for %1. And %2 wasn't explained at all, as you're at it, it'd be good to add.
I don't need a new patch for that.

There was a question about where this got fixed:
This is a trunk-only fix currently, and will be included in FF3 Beta 3. It's not yet fixed on branch. Speaking of which, I'm not sure how we handle changes like this on branch. The core of the fix is a string change, can we do that in point releases?

|  | |

No, we don't do string changes on the branch. Unless we had a chance to backport the fix including l10n from trunk onto the branch, maybe. But even then, I'd strongly discourage that, as that'd break existing language packs, for which we can't back-port.

Even though it's low severity, the fix still mitigates a public security bug. We should get this on branch if we can.

Can we think of a different fix for the branch that simply pulls strings we already have and uses them so localizers don't need to localize a new string? My guess is that we can use existing strings to make this possible on the branch.

We can't backport to all localizations out there, as there are a few that we just don't have access to, and that are Language packs, claiming to be compatible with Firefox 2.0.0.\*. As langpacks don't update from AMO (other story, other bug), there's no way to fix that.
Thus, a branch patch would have to fall back to something if the new strings wouldn't be present. Either by falling back to the current UI, or to English strings. We would have to keep the old strings, too, so that then updated langpacks would still work on older Firefox 2.0.0.x versions.

Axel, sorry, I should've been more clear.
I meant using \*branch\* strings that already exist not creating new strings on the branch. It would require a different fix than we have on the trunk and might not be the ideal, but would help fix this bug.
Something along the lines of...
Host: <hostname here>
Description: <description here>
Obviously that's a different fix than on trunk, but assuming we have both the "Host" and "Description" strings, it'd solve our localization issues.

Sadly, that's not totally safe. Strings that are the same in English don't necessarily imply that they will be the same in other languages. So we wouldn't just need the same strings, we'd need the same strings in a very similar context, and we'd probably want to run that setup through a review of a few localizers, to see if there's a grammar mismatch.

In 1.8, the prompt string is built up at <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/netwerk/protocol/http/src/nsHttpChannel.cpp#2697> using the bundle at /netwerk/locales/en-US/necko.properties.
I think Pike's suggestion to add new strings with fallback to the old strings (or English) if they're not available sounds like the way to go. I can't think of a better idea.
Should we fallback to the old localized string, or English? Using the old string means locales that don't get updated would still have spoofable dialogs. That might be ok, considering that this is a low-severity problem. Also consider that an English fallback would also carry a spoofing risk, in that someone who does not speak English wouldn't understand it, and so the only readable thing might be the attacker's localized HTTP realm spoof.
For example, if it was English falling back to a Latin locale, the problem might look like:
Καθυστερεί χαρακτηριστικό σε "<http://safe.trustme.com>" όρο, νέα οι υποψήφιο τελειώσει, μα υλικό φταίει εφαμοργής σας. Ως νέο "Enter your paypal login. It's totally safe and secure!".

I think it would probably be better to not depend on the user identifying and comparing this URL. You would be better off doing some automated checks first before throwing it in the user’s face, for example, only show this URL (in red) if it is different from the domain currently opened in the browser chrome.

# BasicAuth dialog realm value spoofing

Window Snyder
January 4, 2008

[1 response](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2008/01/04/basicauth-dialog-realm-value-spoofing/#comments)

**Issue**

The realm value in a basic authentication dialog may be spoofed by a attacker to trick users into thinking the authentication request is coming from a different, trusted site.

**Impact**

When displaying the basic authentication dialog, Firefox displays the actual source of the request at the end of the dialog text.  Some other browsers display the request source at the very beginning of the dialog text or as part of the pop-up window’s title bar, which may be less likely to be confused.

This may allow an attacker to craft basic authentication dialogs that are confusing to users and may result in users sending website credentials to phishing websites.

**Status**

Mozilla is currently investigating this issue and has assigned it an initial security severity rating of low.  You can follow this issue here: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=244273>

**Credit**

The issue was reported to the full-disclosure and bugtraq mailing lists by Aviv Raff.

   > Besides the issue, I still can’t grasp the rating Mozilla gives to exploits or browser issues. IMHO there isn’t any way of rating exploits in security. You deliver either secure or insecure software, Moreover phishing issues are the biggest threat off all because you can’t fix them.
