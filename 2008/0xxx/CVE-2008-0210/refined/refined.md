Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    *   The application uses `register_globals` which is enabled. This allows attacker-controlled GET parameters to overwrite existing variables.
    *   The code uses `extract($_GET)` which imports all GET parameters into the current scope.
    *   The application uses a template system (Smarty) where a template filename is constructed using a user-controlled variable (`$selected_theme`).
    *   Lack of proper sanitization of this variable enables a path traversal attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `selected_theme` GET parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.
*   **`register_globals` Misuse**: The application is vulnerable due to the use of `register_globals`, which is known to be a security risk when not handled properly.
*   **Unsanitized Input**: The code does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the file path for the Smarty template, which directly leads to the file inclusion vulnerability.
*   **Authentication bypass:** It appears that an attacker may also bypass authentication by setting the `f_pass` and `sess[auth]` GET parameters, though this is not the primary focus of the provided exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  The attacker can read any file on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `error.php` script.
*   **Path Traversal:** The attack leverages directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `selected_theme` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `error.php` script and the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the web server.
*   **`register_globals` enabled on server**: The attacker needs the webserver to have enabled `register_globals`

**Additional Details:**
The exploit provided in the document shows a sample URL:
`http://test1.ru/uebimiau/error.php?f_pass=blackybr&sess[auth]=1&selected_theme=../ksuri.php%00`
This demonstrates the path traversal and null byte injection.
