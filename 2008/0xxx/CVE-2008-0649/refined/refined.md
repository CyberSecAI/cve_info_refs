```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `link_id` parameter in the `detail.php` script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In the provided example, the attacker attempts to extract the admin username and email from the `config` table.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `detail.php` script by manipulating the `link_id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
