  "CVE-2008-0001": {
    "description": "Incorrect access mode checks could be used by local attackers to corrupt directory contents and so cause denial of service attacks or potentially execute code.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect access mode checks in the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
       "Incorrect use of flags for access checks."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users could truncate directories to which they had write permission, rendering the contents of the directory inaccessible. This could lead to a denial of service, potential code execution, or orphaning inodes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to write to a directory on a vulnerable Linux system"
