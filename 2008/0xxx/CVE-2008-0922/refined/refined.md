- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `cid` parameter of the `modules.php` script when handling the `Manuales` module with the `viewdownload` operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `modules.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges before exploiting the vulnerability.
