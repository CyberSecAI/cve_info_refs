**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for remote exploitation.
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted "data file" name to the RPM service through the LPD protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable RPM server through the LPD protocol.
- No specific authentication is mentioned.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of RPM <= 4.5.1.11.
- The tested versions were the Elite and Select versions.
- Version 5.0.38.0 is not vulnerable.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available at the provided URL.
- A fix has been released in version 4.5.1.12
