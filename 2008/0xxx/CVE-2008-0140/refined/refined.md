Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `extract($_GET)` without proper sanitization or validation in the `error.php` script of Uebimiau Web-Mail.  This function imports all GET parameters as variables, allowing an attacker to overwrite critical variables such as `selected_theme`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute arbitrary files by manipulating the `selected_theme` variable.  The code uses the unsanitized `selected_theme` variable within the `$smarty->display("$selected_theme/error.htm");` call to include a file path, leading to the file inclusion.
*   **register_globals like behavior:** Due to the usage of extract($_GET), this behaves like the register_globals php configuration which has been deprecated as it allows to override PHP variables.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `selected_theme` parameter, before using it in a file inclusion context.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file reading**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential for further exploitation**: By including files with malicious PHP code, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request**: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `error.php` script.
*   **Manipulated variables:** The attacker provides malicious values for `f_pass` (or other credentials) and `sess[auth]` to bypass the authentication and then provides a path to a file using the `selected_theme` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Uebimiau Web-Mail instance.
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests**: Ability to form HTTP GET requests with the specific parameter names and values.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable script:** Understanding of the vulnerabilities of the `error.php` script and how to manipulate the `selected_theme` parameter.

**Additional Information**
* The exploit uses a null byte to truncate the path, for example `../ksuri.php%00`, to bypass checks for valid file extensions.
* The exploit requires PHP register_globals equivalent configuration, which is achieved by `extract($_GET)`.
* The provided exploit example uses `f_pass=blackybr&sess[auth]=1` to bypass authentication, it is unclear what the values do exactly, but it is mentioned in the provided text: `So , if register_globals on , we can make a request like script.php?f_pass=+toxa+&sess[auth]=1 to make script think that we are authorized user.`
