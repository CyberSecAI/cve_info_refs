# Security Advisory 0803

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in multiple modules
Date              : 13 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6e and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0803
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-0073, CVE-2008-1489, CVE-2008-1768, CVE-2008-1769

```
## Details

VLC media player's following modules suffer from arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files:
Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, Cinepak decoder.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the MP4 / Real Media demuxer or the Cinepak decoder issues requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user is asked to open Real RTSP / Real Media streams and MP4 files as well as files containing Cinepak video streams from trusted content providers only. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams or files. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL, while the MP4 container file type is recognizable by the `mp4` suffix. Cinepak encoded video streams are usually found in MOV and MP4 container files only, which may be perceived by their `mp4` and `mov` suffixes. Real Media files usually include `ram`, `ra` or `rm` suffixes.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6f addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes.

Pre-compiled packages are available at the usual download locations.

## Credits

The Real RTSP demuxer, Real media demuxer, MP4 demuxer and Cinepak codec vulnerabilities were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple Product Security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6681 CVE-2007-6682 CVE-2007-6683 CVE-2008-0295
                 CVE-2008-0296 CVE-2008-0073 CVE-2008-0984 CVE-2008-1489

Luigi Auriemma, Alin Rad Pop, RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont, Quovodis, Guido
Landi, Felipe Manzano, Anibal Sacco and others discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in vlc, an application for playback and streaming of
audio and video.  In the worst case, these weaknesses permit a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running vlc.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following eight problems:

CVE-2007-6681

    A buffer overflow vulnerability in subtitle handling allows an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code through the opening of a
    maliciously crafted MicroDVD, SSA or Vplayer file.

CVE-2007-6682

    A format string vulnerability in the HTTP-based remote control
    facility of the vlc application allows a remote, unauthenticated
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-6683

    Insecure argument validation allows a remote attacker to overwrite
    arbitrary files writable by the user running vlc, if a maliciously
    crafted M3U playlist or MP3 audio file is opened.

CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

    Heap buffer overflows in RTSP stream and session description
    protocol (SDP) handling allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code if a maliciously-crafted RTSP stream is played.

CVE-2008-0073

    Insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling allows the
    execution of arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted SDP
    stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream.

CVE-2008-0984

    Insufficient integrity checking in the MP4 demuxer allows a remote
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory and execute arbitrary code
    if a maliciously-crafted MP4 file is opened.

CVE-2008-1489

    An integer overflow vulnerability in MP4 handling allows a remote
    attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow, inducing a crash and
    possibly the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    MP4 file is opened.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-5.1+etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.8.e-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.

Package        : xine-lib
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-1246 CVE-2007-1387 CVE-2008-0073 CVE-2008-0486
                 CVE-2008-1161
Debian Bug     : 464696

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xine, a
media player library, allowed for a denial of service or arbitrary code
execution, which could be exploited through viewing malicious content.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-1246 / CVE-2007-1387

    The DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function does not set the biSize before use in a
    memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow
    and possibly execute arbitrary code (applies to sarge only).

CVE-2008-0073

    Array index error in the sdpplin_parse function allows remote RTSP servers
    to execute arbitrary code via a large streamid SDP parameter.

CVE-2008-0486

    Array index vulnerability in libmpdemux/demux_audio.c might allow remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted FLAC tag, which triggers
    a buffer overflow (applies to etch only).

CVE-2008-1161

    Buffer overflow in the Matroska demuxer allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Matroska
    file with invalid frame sizes.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.1.2+dfsg-6.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This is mainly a bug-fix release; 1.1.5 has CD audio and DVD playback problems and a couple of X-related build problems. It also contains an updated Mac OS X video output plugin.  Please check the [release notes](https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=501970&group_id=9655) for details.  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 10.04.2007 | xine-lib 1.1.5 | | --- | --- | | A new xine-lib version is now available. This release contains a security fix ([CVE-2007-1246](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1246)); it also contains XCB support, and has portability fixes for Mac OS X and OpenBSD.  Please check the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=499925) for details.  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 03.04.2007 | Mad as a hatter | | --- | --- | | We've switched over from CVS to [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) for xine-lib and gxine. You can find the new repositories at <http://hg.debian.org/hg/>; their names all begin with xine-lib/.  If you want to access these repositories and are unfamiliar with Mercurial, you should visit [Mercurial's Getting Started section](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/#head-fa3b1ac44fb16c1886b6a5e46254b3874a399a14).  Everything else is still being maintained via CVS. |  | 03.02.2007 | xine-plugin 1.0 | | --- | --- | | This is a media player plugin for Mozilla browsers and other browsers which provide the same plugin interface.  xine-plugin is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/xine-plugin-1.0.tar.bz2?download). |  | 01.02.2007 | gxine 0.5.11 | | --- | --- | | This is a bugfix release, fixing some configuration problems which only show up if you use gxine 0.5.10 with GTK+ 2.10 and xine-lib 1.1.4. If you do, you are advised to upgrade.  gxine 0.5.11 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.11.tar.bz2?download). |  | 29.01.2007 | xine-lib 1.1.4 | | --- | --- | | A new xine-lib version is now available. This release fixes some important issues that have "bugged" us for quite some time.  Please check the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=482174) for details.  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 08.01.2007 | gxine 0.5.10 | | --- | --- | | **This release fixes a security bug (possible local exploit). If you are using any older version, you are advised to upgrade to this version or a suitably-patched version supplied by your chosen distribution.**  Other than that, just a few miscellaneous fixes...  gxine 0.5.10 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.10.tar.bz2?download). |  | 17.12.2006 | gxine 0.5.9 | | --- | --- | | New features: prevent screen blanking in windowed mode; show time remaining; include a JPEG version of the logo for when distributors are scared to include MPEG codecs in xine-lib. gxine also now knows about xscreensaver.  And some minor fixes. Nothing significant :-)  gxine 0.5.9 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.9.tar.bz2?download). |  | 03.12.2006 | xine-lib 1.1.3 | | --- | --- | | xine-lib version 1.1.3 is now available for download. This release contains several bug and security fixes.  Please take a minute to read the [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=468432).  Download it from [our download page](/index.php/download). |  | 07.10.2006 | gxine 0.5.8 | | --- | --- | | Another maintenance release - the usual collection of fixes and minor new stuff (in particular, an eject() command).  gxine 0.5.8 is available from [our download page](/index.php/download) or [directly from Sourceforge](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xine/gxine-0.5.8.tar.bz2?download). | |

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VLC: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/vlc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6f** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6f** |

### Background

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).
* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP servers in
  Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).
* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).
* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer,
  the Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).
* Drew Yao finally discovered and a
  boundary error in Cinepak, which might lead to memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1769).

### Impact

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

# Security Advisory 0801

```

Summary           : Format string vulnerability in the Web interface
                    Stack-based buffer overflow in the Subtitles demuxer
                    String buffer overflows in the Real RTSP demuxer
Date              : 27 February 2008, 2 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6d and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0801
CVE references    : CVE-2007-6681, CVE-2007-6682, CVE-2008-0295, CVE-2008-0296

```
## Details

VLC media player's web interface suffers from a format string vulnerability when using specially crafted requests.

Its subtitle demuxer is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by parsing maliciously crafted files.

Its Real RTSP demuxer is based upon an older Xine library fork, which is prone to multiple buffer overflows triggered by maliciously crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) data or by specific RTSP server responses.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could remotely use the Web interface or the Real RTSP demuxer or locally trigger the subtitles parser to execute arbitrary code within the context of VLC media player or crash the current player instance.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the Web interface problem requires the user to explicitly enable this interface. It is disabled by default.

Subtitle files can be manually opened by the user or automatically based on the filename of the movie. Both ways may lead to exploitation of the Subtitle Parser's buffer-overflow.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user may refrain from using the Web interface until an update is installed or limit its usage to secure environments. VLC media player can also be controlled remotely through the RC and telnet interfaces.

Automatic detection of subtitle files can be disabled by unchecking the "Autodetect subtitle files" option in the Subtitle category inside the Video preferences. Note that you need to restart VLC media player for this change to take effect. In case that you use VLC media player through the command-line, provide `--no-sub-autodetect-file` to override its default behavior.

The user is asked to use subtitle files authored by trusted sources only.

The user is asked to only open Real RTSP streams from trusted content providers. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6e addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes. Version 0.8.6f implements additional security improvements to the Subtitle Parser.

Pre-compiled packages will be available at the usual download locations shortly.

## Credits

The Subtitle Parser vulnerability was discovered by Michal Luczaj.

The Web interface vulnerability was reported by Luigi Auriemma.

The Real RTSP demuxer vulnerabilities were published by Luigi Auriemma.

## Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP

parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2008-0073](/security/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check

buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an

RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0225](/security/CVE-2008-0225), [CVE-2008-0238](/security/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not

properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be

able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](/security/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly

check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](/security/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not

properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](/security/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV,

MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1482](/security/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input

when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an

attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](/security/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib

when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted

NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2008-1878](/security/CVE-2008-1878))

# Security Advisory 0803

```

Summary           : Buffer overflows in multiple modules
Date              : 13 April 2008
Affected versions : VLC media player 0.8.6e and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-0803
CVE reference     : CVE-2008-0073, CVE-2008-1489, CVE-2008-1768, CVE-2008-1769

```
## Details

VLC media player's following modules suffer from arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files:
Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, Cinepak decoder.

## Impact

If successful, a malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of the MP4 / Real Media demuxer or the Cinepak decoder issues requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams.

Exploitation of the Real RTSP problems requires the user to explicitly open streams provided by malicious third parties.

## Workarounds

The user is asked to open Real RTSP / Real Media streams and MP4 files as well as files containing Cinepak video streams from trusted content providers only. In case of uncertainess, it is recommended not to open this kind of streams or files. RTSP streams can easily be identified by the `rtsp` prefix of their URL/MRL, while the MP4 container file type is recognizable by the `mp4` suffix. Cinepak encoded video streams are usually found in MOV and MP4 container files only, which may be perceived by their `mp4` and `mov` suffixes. Real Media files usually include `ram`, `ra` or `rm` suffixes.

## Solution

VLC media player 0.8.6f addresses these issues and introduces further
usability fixes.

Pre-compiled packages are available at the usual download locations.

## Credits

The Real RTSP demuxer, Real media demuxer, MP4 demuxer and Cinepak codec vulnerabilities were discovered by Drew Yao of Apple Product Security.

# xine-lib: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200808-01**

xine-lib is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows when processing media
streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.13** |

### Background

xine-lib is the core library package for the xine media player, and
other players such as Amarok, Codeine/Dragon Player and Kaffeine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib:

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in the
  sdpplin\_parse() function in the file input/libreal/sdpplin.c when
  processing streams from RTSP servers that contain a large "streamid"
  SDP parameter (CVE-2008-0073).
* Luigi Auriemma reported multiple integer overflows that result in
  heap-based buffer overflows when processing ".FLV", ".MOV" ".RM",
  ".MVE", ".MKV", and ".CAK" files (CVE-2008-1482).
* Guido Landi reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  demux\_nsf\_send\_chunk() function when handling titles within NES Music
  (.NSF) files (CVE-2008-1878).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted video
file or stream with a player using xine-lib, potentially resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the player.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.13"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- xine NSF buffer overflow
Specially crafted NSF files could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-1878).
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686).
Updated packages have been released for all SUSE distributions
containing XINE.
- xemacs and emacs fast-lock file problems
Emacs and Xemacs automatically loaded fast-lock files which allowed
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user editing the
associated files (CVE-2008-2142).
Xemacs and Emacs have been updated on all SUSE distributions.
- opensuse-updater tmp problems and off-by-one problems
The opensuse-updater on openSUSE 10.2 was updated to fix a symlink
problem and two off-by-one vulnerabilities.
The overflows can be considered no security problem and are tracked
by CVE-2008-2388.
The symlink flaw could be used by local users to gain unauthorized
access to information (like passwords) and is tracked by
CVE-2008-2389.
Only openSUSE 10.2 was affected by this problem.
- libvorbis security problems
Several security problems were fixed in libvorbis:
CVE-2008-1419 - Division by zero
CVE-2008-1420 - integer overflow
CVE-2008-1423 - integer overflow
libvorbis was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- xine sdpplin\_parse overflow
Xine was updated to fix a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse()
that allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a
buffers bound.
This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code remotely
if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated on all SUSE distributions.
- vorbis-tools speex code execution problem
Specially crafted files or streams could potentially be abused to
trick applications that support speex into executing arbitrary code
(CVE-2008-1686) using vorbis-tools.
vorbis-tools was fixed on all SUSE distributions.
- pdns-recursor spoofing problems
Pdns-recursor was prone to a spoofing vulnerability which could be
abused to redirect clients or manipulate data. (CVE-2008-1637)
pdns / pdns-recursor is shipped on SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- openwsman post-auth remote code execution
Openwsman was updated to provide a fix for the included shttpd
web-server to patch a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP
request parser.
This bug can only be exploited by authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the openwsman/shttp
daemon. (CVE-2008-2097)
Only openSUSE 10.3 contains openwsman and was fixed.

2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Linux kernel update
We are currently preparing a kernel update for all products to catch up on security
problems and bugs found in the last months.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- unzip crash due to uninitialized memory
Specially crafted files could lead unzip into using uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-0888)
unzip updates have been released for all distributions.
- tomcat security updates
Tomcat was updated to improve the list of supported SSL ciphers
(CVE-2007-1858) and to fix cross site scripting bugs (CVE-2007-2449).
tomcat5,tomcat55,apache2-mod\_jk were updated for all affected SUSE
Linux distributions.
- moodle smarty code injection problem
A bug in the smarty version contained in moodle could be exploited
by attackers to execute arbitrary php code (CVE-2008-1066).
moodle is contained on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- xine sdpplin\_parse problem
This update fixes a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse() that
allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a buffers
bound. This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code
remotely if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated for all affected distributions.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Sun Java current release
Sun has updated Sun Java 1.4 to update 17, Sun Java 1.5 to update
15, and Sun Java 6 to update 5.
These Sun Java updates are currently tested in QA.
- Apache2 and Apache roll-up security release
We are currently testing a roll-up of all pending Apache2 and
Apache security issues. A separate advisory will be published once
we release those updates.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
