CVE-2008-0073: The sdpplin_parse function in input/libreal/sdpplin.c in xine-lib before 1.1.13, as used in VLC media player, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted SDP stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream that triggers an array index error.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerabilities when using specially crafted (invalid) input streams / files in Real RTSP and Real media demuxers, MP4 demuxer, and Cinepak decoder. Specifically, the Real RTSP demuxer is vulnerable due to insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling which allows execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious third party could trigger the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the running instance or terminate the application unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires the user to explicitly open specially crafted files or streams, or open RTSP streams provided by malicious third parties.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must be able to provide a crafted stream or file.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: String buffer overflows in the Real RTSP demuxer (based upon an older Xine library fork), triggered by maliciously crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) data or specific RTSP server responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**:  String buffer overflows in Real RTSP demuxer and vulnerable SDP parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious third party could remotely use the Real RTSP demuxer to execute arbitrary code within the context of VLC media player or crash the current player instance.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted SDP data or specific RTSP server responses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must control a malicious RTSP server.
