Alert
# Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-187A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows XP
* Microsoft Windows Server 2003

### Overview

An unpatched vulnerability in the Microsoft Video ActiveX control is being used in attacks.

Microsoft has released [Security Advisory (972890)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/972890.mspx) to describe attacks on a vulnerability in the Microsoft Video ActiveX control. Because no fix is currently available for this vulnerability, please see the Security Advisory and US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#180513](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/180513) for workarounds.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the victim user.

### Solution

#### Apply Updates

Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS09-032.mspx) for more details.

#### Apply workarounds

Microsoft has provided workarounds for this vulnerability in [Security Advisory (972890)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/972890.mspx). Additional details and workarounds are provided in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#180513](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/180513).

The most effective workaround for this vulnerability is to set kill bits for the Microsoft Video ActiveX control, as outlined in the documents noted above. Other workarounds include disabling ActiveX, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](/reading_room/securing_browser/) document, and upgrading to Internet Explorer 7 or later, which can help mitigate the vulnerability with its ActiveX opt-in feature.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-037 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution (973908)

Published: August 11, 2009 | Updated: December 16, 2009

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user loaded a specially crafted component or control hosted on a malicious website. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information on the software affected by this update, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section. For more information on the impact of, and workarounds and mitigations for controls and components that may be vulnerable to these issues, please see [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882).

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the ATL headers so that components and controls built using the headers can safely initialize from a data stream, and by providing updated versions of Windows components and controls built using corrected ATL headers. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 973908](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/973908) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin rereleased on September 8, 2009?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to offer new updates for the HtmlInput Object ActiveX control on Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Windows Vista, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Windows Vista x64 Edition, Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1, and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2.

**What is the HtmlInput Object ActiveX control?**

The HtmlInput Object ActiveX control enables Windows Media Center hosted HTML applications to include instances of the Triple-tap/Soft-keyboard ActiveX control on their HTML pages. The control provides a standard interface for retrieving text input from the user, enabling them to enter text by using the remote control. For more information, see the MSDN article, [HtmlInput Object](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms814716.aspx).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**How does this bulletin relate to the vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)?**
This bulletin addresses Windows components that are affected by the Active Template Library (ATL) vulnerabilities described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882).

**Is this security update related to MS09-034, released as an out-of-band update on July 28, 2009?**

Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that helps prevent components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8, that monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's Kill Bit Security Feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install this update?**

Yes. This security bulletin update addresses vulnerabilities in Windows components. By installing this update, users ensure that all known issues caused by vulnerable ATL headers and libraries are corrected for core Windows components.

**If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install additional components and controls issued by third-parties that address the vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 973882 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035?**
Yes, you need to install updated controls from third parties when released. The [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199) Internet Explorer mitigation does not address the underlying vulnerabilities within certain components and controls developed with the Active Template Library. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**What is ATL?**
The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that let developers create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls. For more information, see the following [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3ax346b7%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What is the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control?**
The DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control provides an HTML editor that developers can use to support dynamic Web site HTML editing in software. For more information about the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control, see the following [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa753630%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the Microsoft MSWebDVD ActiveX Control?**
The Microsoft MSWebDVD ActiveX control is used to create script-based DVD applications by exposing the MSWebDVD object to applications. For more information, see the following [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd390904%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is Outlook Express?**
Outlook Express is a feature of the Windows operating system for personal computers. It is used for sending and receiving e-mail.

**What is Windows Media Player?**
Windows Media Player is a feature of the Windows operating system for personal computers. It is used for playing audio and video.

**Are third-party components and controls affected by this issue?**
Some third-party components and controls may be affected by this issue if certain conditions were met during the building of the components and controls. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

## Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to the function CComVariant::ReadFromStream used in the ATL header. This function does not properly restrict untrusted data read from a stream. This issue leads to reading data directly onto the stack instead of reading it into the area of memory allocated for an array, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The function CComVariant::ReadFromStream used in the ATL header does not properly restrict untrusted data read from a stream. This issue could lead to reading data directly onto the stack instead of reading it into the area of memory allocated for an array.

**Is this security update related to MS09-032?**

Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=157386), "Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits," includes ActiveX kill bits for msvidctl.dll as a part of CVE-2008-0015. This bulletin, MS09-037, also addresses components affected by CVE-2008-0015. In MS09-032, kill bits were provided for msvidctl.dll, since that component was never intended to be instantiated within Internet Explorer. The components addressed in this bulletin may be instantiated, and have been updated to address the core issue covered by CVE-2008-0015.

**If I have installed the MS09-032 update, do I still need to install this update?**

Yes. This security update addresses vulnerabilities in Windows components. By installing this update, users ensure that all known issues caused by vulnerable ATL headers and libraries are corrected for core Windows components.

**Are third-party ActiveX controls affected by this issue?**

Although this vulnerability is in Microsoft ATL, it is not in the ATL version shipped with Visual Studio. The affected ATL headers reside in a private header file that shipped in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Most third-party developers use the header file that came with Visual Studio. These applications are not exposed to this vulnerability.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user has a vulnerable control on their system and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |

| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

## Microsoft Video ActiveX control stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#180513

Original Release Date: 2009-07-06 | Last Revised: 2009-07-15

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Video ActiveX control contains a stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows comes with an ActiveX component called "ActiveX control for streaming video," which is provided by msvidctl.dll. This component provides a number of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) that are marked as Safe for Scripting and Safe for Initialization, which means that they can be used by Internet Explorer. The ActiveX controls provided by msvidctl.dll fail to properly handle file input, which can result in stack memory corruption. This can allow the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) to be overwritten, thus allowing subversion of the program execution flow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-032.mspx) for more information. |
| --- |

| **Disable the vulnerable ActiveX controls**Microsoft Security Advisory ([972890](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/972890.mspx)) explains how to disable the 45 ActiveX controls provided by msvidctl.dll to mitigate this vulnerability. A Microsoft Fix it application is provided in Microsoft Knowledgebase article [972890](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972890) to disable these controls.**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |

# Microsoft Security Advisory 973882

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: July 28, 2009 | Updated: October 13, 2009

**Version:** 4.0

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about our ongoing investigation into vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL). This advisory also provides guidance as to what developers can do to help ensure that the controls and components they have built are not vulnerable to the ATL issues; what IT Professionals and consumers can do to mitigate potential attacks that use the vulnerabilities; and what Microsoft is doing as part of its ongoing investigation into the issue described in this advisory. This security advisory will also provide a comprehensive listing of all Microsoft Security Bulletins and Security Updates related to the vulnerabilities in ATL. Microsoft's investigation into the private and public versions of ATL is ongoing, and we will release security updates and guidance as appropriate as part of the investigation process.

Microsoft is aware of security vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of ATL. The Microsoft ATL is used by software developers to create controls or components for the Windows platform. The vulnerabilities described in this Security Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) could result in information disclosure or remote code execution attacks for controls and components built using vulnerable versions of the ATL. Components and controls created with the vulnerable version of ATL may be exposed to a vulnerable condition due to how ATL is used or due to issues in the ATL code itself.

**Developer Guidance:** Microsoft has corrected the issues in the public headers of ATL and released updates to the libraries in bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution." Microsoft strongly recommends that developers who have built controls or components with ATL take immediate action to evaluate their controls for exposure to a vulnerable condition and follow the guidance provided to create controls and components that are not vulnerable. For more information on the vulnerabilities and guidance to address issues in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**IT Professional and Consumer Guidance:** To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. To benefit from this new defense-in-depth technology, IT Professionals and consumers should immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer."

This security update includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense-in-depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8. These defense-in-depth protections monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**Home User Guidance:** To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer with the new update helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Home users signed up for Automatic Updates will receive the new Internet Explorer update automatically and do not have to take any further action. Home Users will automatically be better protected from future attacks against the vulnerabilities addressed in this Security Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035.

**Mitigating Factors for Controls and Components built using vulnerable version of Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL):**

* By default, the majority of ActiveX controls are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8 running on Windows Vista or later operating systems. Only customers who have explicitly approved vulnerable controls by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk to attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used such ActiveX controls in a previous version of Internet Explorer, and then later upgraded to Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8, then these ActiveX controls are enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.
* By default, Internet Explorer 8 offers enhanced protections by enabling DEP/NX memory protections for users on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and Windows 7.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Updates related to ATL:**

Update released on October 13, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-060](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=160633), "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution," provides support for Microsoft Office components that are affected by the ATL vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

Updates released on August 25, 2009

* Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089 is being released to address vulnerabilities in the Windows Live Messenger client that are related to the ATL vulnerabilities described in this advisory.
* A **Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Live Components** section has been added to this advisory to communicate the removal of the Windows Live Hotmail "Attach Photo" feature and to provide details about the Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089 release.

Updates released on August 11, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-037](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158695), "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution," provides support for Windows components that are affected by the ATL vulnerabilities described in this advisory.
* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution," is being rereleased to offer new updates for developers who use Visual Studio to create components and controls for mobile applications using ATL for Smart Devices.

Updates released on July 28, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution," goes into further detail about the specific vulnerabilities in ATL and provides the updated public ATL headers for vendors to develop updated components and controls. Our investigation has shown that there are Microsoft and third-party components and controls that are affected by this issue and that these components and controls exist on all supported editions of Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. Developers who used vulnerable versions of the ATL when building controls or components should review this bulletin and take immediate action if their controls are vulnerable.
* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8. These defense-in-depth protections monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.
* We are not aware of any methods or controls included with Windows 7 that would allow attacks to be successful through Internet Explorer.

Update released on July 14, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms09-032), "Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits," provided ActiveX security measures (a kill bit) that prevented the msvidctl control from running in Internet Explorer. The exploit in msvidcntl took advantage of a vulnerability in the private version of ATL. In this specific instance, the vulnerability allows an attacker to corrupt memory, which may lead to a remote code execution. The kill bits issued in the June release for msvidctl (MS09-032) will block the public exploits as described here.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the advisory?**

Microsoft is aware of vulnerabilities affecting components and controls built using public and private versions of the Active Template Library (ATL). The advisory aims to make users aware of updates that help mitigate the risk of vulnerable controls and components, provide guidance and direction to developers who have built controls and components using the vulnerable ATL, and to IT professionals on how to protect and install mitigations in their environment.

**Will Microsoft release additional security updates related to this Security Advisory in the future?**

Microsoft's investigation into the private and public headers of ATL is ongoing and we will release security updates and guidance as appropriate as part of the investigation process.

**Was the msvidctl vulnerability (MS09-032) related to this ATL update?**

Yes, the exploit in msvidctl took advantage of a vulnerability in the private version of ATL. In this specific instance, the vulnerability allows an attacker to corrupt memory, which may lead to a remote code execution. [MS09-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms09-032), previously issued in the July 14 release, blocks known attacks for msvidctl. For more information on the exploit in msvidctl, see <https://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/07/06/new-vulnerability-in-mpeg2tunerequest-activex-control-object-in-msvidctl-dll.aspx>.

**Will the Internet Explorer update (ms09-034) also protect against msvidctl attacks?**

Yes, the Internet Explorer mitigations will protect against the exploitation of the known vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of ATL, including the msvidctl attacks.

**What is ATL?**

The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that lets you create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. ATL has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls. For more information, see the MSDN article, [ATL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What causes this threat in ATL?**

The issue is caused in some cases by the way ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. In these cases, data streams may be handled incorrectly, which can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and instantiation of objects without regard to security policy. For more information on the vulnerabilities addressed in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**What are the differences between the public and private versions of the Active Template Library?**

The private version of the Active Template Library is used by Microsoft developers to build controls and components. Microsoft has updated all versions of the Active Template Library used by our developers.

The public version of the Active Template Library is distributed to customers through developer tools, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Microsoft is providing an updated version of our public ATL through Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035.

**Will the security vulnerabilities in ATL require Microsoft and third-party developers to issue security updates?**

Yes. In addition to the bulletin updates described in this advisory, Microsoft is performing a comprehensive investigation of Microsoft controls and components. Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-band security update, depending on customer needs.

Microsoft is also providing guidance and is actively contacting major third-party developers to help them identify vulnerable controls and components. This may result in security updates for third party controls and components.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Live Services

**How will the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger be distributed?**

Upon signing on to Windows Live Messenger service, users of Windows Live Messenger 8.1, Windows Live Messenger 8.5, and Windows Live Messenger 14.0 on supported releases of Windows will be prompted by the client deployment mechanism in the Windows Live Messenger service to accept the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089. Also, users who desire to download the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089 immediately may do so by using the [Windows Live Download Center](https://download.live.com/messenger). Otherwise, users of vulnerable versions of the Windows Live Messenger clients may not be allowed to connect to the Windows Live Messenger service.

**Why is Microsoft releasing the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger over the Windows Live Messenger service as well as providing downloads?**

Microsoft currently issues upgrades for the Windows Live Messenger client using the Windows Live Messenger service because these online services have their own client deployment mechanism. However, Microsoft Download Center links are also available for specific Windows Live Messenger clients. Users who desire to download the upgrades immediately may do so at the [Windows Live Download Center](https://download.live.com/messenger).

**If this is an upgrade, how can I detect if I have a vulnerable version of Windows Live Messenger?**

When you attempt to sign on to the Windows Live Messenger service, the client deployment mechanism will automatically determine your current client version and platform and if required, recommend the appropriate upgrade. Also, you may verify your Windows Live Messenger client version by clicking **Help** and then **About**.

**What happens if I do not upgrade to the most current version of Windows Live Messenger?**

If you do not upgrade to a non-affected version of the Windows Live Messenger client, depending on your platform, you will be notified to upgrade on each attempt to sign on. If you do not accept the upgrade, you may not be allowed access to Windows Live Messenger service.

**Are other Microsoft Real-Time Collaboration applications, like Windows Messenger or Office Communicator, affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Other messaging applications are not affected as they do not contain the vulnerable component.

**When did Microsoft remove the Windows Live Hotmail "Attach Photo" feature? Did it coincide with the launch of another new feature?**

Microsoft recently made the decision to remove the feature on a short-term basis in order to fix the issue. The temporary removal of this feature did not coincide with the launch of another feature.

**What is latest timetable for the "Attach Photo" feature to be fully restored to all Windows Live Hotmail users?**

Microsoft is actively working to correct the problem. In the meantime, you are still able to add pictures as attachments to your Hotmail messages by clicking **Attach**, and then selecting the picture you want to include.

## Frequently Asked Questions from Developers about the Visual Studio Update

**What causes this threat in ATL?**

The issue is caused in some cases by the way ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. In these cases, data streams may be handled incorrectly, which can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and instantiation of objects without regard to security policy. For more information on the vulnerabilities addressed in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

For controls and components built using ATL, unsafe usage of certain macros could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects that can bypass related ActiveX security policy (i.e. kill bits) within Internet Explorer. Additionally, components and controls built using the vulnerable version of ATL may be vulnerable to remote code execution or information disclosure threats. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, and they have a vulnerable control on their system, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use ATL in my component or control. Is my component or control vulnerable, and if so, how do I update it?**

Components and controls may be affected by this issue if certain conditions are met during the building of the component or control. [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) contains additional information, examples, and guidance that third-party developers can use to detect and correct vulnerable components and controls.

**What does the Security Update for Visual Studio do?**

These updates address vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) that could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to run arbitrary code on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are in some cases caused by the way that ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. Since these vulnerabilities affect ATL, components or controls that were developed using ATL may expose customers using the affected controls and components to remote code execution scenarios.

The security update for Visual Studio updates the vulnerable version of the ATL used by Visual Studio. This allows Visual Studio users to modify and re-build their controls and components using an updated version of the ATL.

Our investigation has shown that both Microsoft and third-party components and controls may be affected by this issue. Therefore, all affected vendors must modify, and rebuild, their components and controls using the corrected ATL provided in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).

## Frequently Asked Questions from IT Professionals about what they can do to protect themselves

**Does the IE update MS09-034 protect me from all components and controls that were built on the vulnerable version of ATL?**

To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities.

Microsoft is continuing to investigate all Microsoft controls and components and is helping third party developers evaluate their controls and components.

**What action can an IT professional take to mitigate exposure to this issue?**

Microsoft strongly recommends that IT professionals immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer."

## Frequently Asked Questions about what Consumers can do to protect themselves

**What action can consumers take to mitigate exposure to this issue?**

To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Microsoft strongly recommends that consumers turn on [Automatic Update](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windowsupdate/automaticupdate.mspx) and immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer." Home users who receive updates automatically will receive the mitigations provided in the cumulative IE update and other security updates related to this issue, and do not have to take further action.

Microsoft also encourages Home users to upgrade to [Internet Explorer 8](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx) to benefit from enhanced security and protections.

## Frequently asked Questions about the mitigations in Internet Explorer Update

**What causes this threat which could allow the bypass of ActiveX security?**

ActiveX controls built with vulnerable ATL methods may not correctly validate information. This could result in an ActiveX control that allows memory corruption, or allows an attacker to leverage a trusted ActiveX control to load an un-trusted ActiveX control that had been previously blocked from running in Internet Explorer.

The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8, that monitor and prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing the IE kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**What might an attacker use this function to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability on Windows Vista or Windows 2008 would only gain rights as a restricted user due to Protect Mode in Internet Explorer. On other Windows systems, the attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an Attacker use this function?**

An attacker could host a Web site that is designed to host a specially crafted ActiveX control and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an instant messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What is a kill bit?**

A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as "setting the kill bit." After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.

For more information on kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797): How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. For more detailed information on kill bits and how they function within Internet Explorer see the following [Security Research and Defense](https://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2008/02/06/the-kill_2d00_bit-faq_3a00_-part-1-of-3.aspx) blog post.

**What does the update do?**

The update strengthens the ActiveX security mechanism by providing validation when unsafe methods are used by ActiveX controls using vulnerable ATL headers in specific configurations.

**Does this update change functionality?**

Yes. This update no longer allows specific sets of ATL methods to run within Internet Explorer. The update mitigates the risk of bypassing active security by preventing trusted ActiveX controls from loading un-trusted controls

**Does this update contain additional software changes?**

Yes. This update also contains additional security fixes and other updates to Internet Explorer as part of the cumulative update for Internet Explorer.

**Does this update address all unsafe ActiveX control scenarios?**

No. This update specifically addresses unsafe/un-trusted ActiveX controls that may be vulnerable to the ATL issues described in this Advisory to protect customers from attack when browsing the Internet.

Microsoft is continuing to investigate this issue. Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-band security update, depending on customer needs.

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and later protect me from this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and later operating systems run in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista and later, which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the following post: [https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-I\_3A00\_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

#### Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High.**

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to **High**.

**Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High.**

**Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High.**

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To accomplish this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
2. Click the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To accomplish this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

Alert
# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-223A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft Office
* Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac.

Microsoft has released multiple security bulletins for critical vulnerabilities in Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components, and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. These bulletins are described in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx).

Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-037.mspx) includes updates for Microsoft components to address vulnerabilities in the Active Template Library ([ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28VS.71%29.aspx)). Vulnerabilities present in the ATL can cause vulnerabilities in the resulting ActiveX controls and COM components. Any ActiveX control or COM component that was created with a vulnerable version of the ATL may be vulnerable, including ones distributed by third-party developers.

Developers should update the ATL as described in the previously released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx) in order to stop creating vulnerable controls. To address vulnerabilities in existing controls, recompile the controls using the updated ATL. Further discussion about the ATL vulnerabilities can be found in the [Microsoft Security Advisory 973882](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/973882.mspx).

### Impact

An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, in some cases without user interaction.

### Solution

**Apply updates from Microsoft**

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as [Windows Server Update Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx) (WSUS).

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-032 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits (973346)

Published: July 14, 2009 | Updated: July 23, 2009

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability that is currently being exploited. The vulnerability in Microsoft Video ActiveX Control could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating the ActiveX control. This ActiveX control was never intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP and Moderate for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by setting a kill bit so that the vulnerable control does not run in Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 972890](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/972890).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**\*Windows Server 2008 server core installation not affected.** The vulnerability addressed by this update does not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008 if Windows Server 2008 was installed using the Server Core installation option. For more information on this installation option, see [Server Core](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms723891%28vs.85%29.aspx). Note that the Server Core installation option does not apply to certain editions of Windows Server 2008; see [Compare Server Core Installation Options](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/compare-core-installation.aspx).

\*\*Severity ratings do not apply to this update because the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin does not affect this software. However, as a defense-in-depth measure to protect against any possible new vectors identified in the future, Microsoft recommends that customers of this software apply this security update.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**If I have applied the workaround from Microsoft Security Advisory 972890, do I need to install this security update?**

[Microsoft Security Advisory 972890](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/972890) describes a workaround that prevents the Microsoft Video ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer. Customers can either manually apply this workaround or use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972890](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972890) to enable the workaround. Customers who have applied this workaround using either method do not need to install this security update.

This update will be offered to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 systems regardless of whether the workaround was applied. However, the vulnerability addressed by this update does not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008 if Windows Server 2008 was installed using the Server Core installation option, and such Server Core installations will not be offered this update. Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems will not be offered this update if the workaround has been applied. All customers may install this security update without negative impact.

Customers who want this update to be offered to Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 systems must remove the kill bit settings previously applied by the workaround by deleting the registry keys referenced in the workaround, "Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer."

**Do I need to undo the workaround from Microsoft Security Advisory 972890 before installing this security update?**

Customers do not need to undo the workaround described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 972890](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/972890), whether this workaround was applied manually, or automatically using the Microsoft Fix it solution in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972890](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972890) to enable the workaround, before installing this update.

**What would happen if I install this update and then undo the workaround from Microsoft Security Advisory 972890?**

In this scenario, customers of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 install this security update for defense-in-depth and then either manually undo the workaround from [Microsoft Security Advisory 972890](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/972890), or use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972890](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972890) to disable the workaround. Such customers will no longer prevent the Microsoft Video ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer, making their systems vulnerable. Also, such systems will not be reoffered this update since future detection results will yield the successful installation that was undone by workaround.

**Does this Cumulative Security Update for ActiveX Kill Bits contain the kill bits described in Microsoft Security Advisory 973472?**
No, this update does not include the kill bits for preventing the Office Web Components (OWC) Library from running in Internet Explorer, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 973472](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973472). To set those kill bits, follow the guidance in the Workaround section of that advisory.

**What kill bits does this Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits contain?**

This Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits contains all kill bits previously released in [MS08-023](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms08-023), Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits; [MS08-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms08-032), Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits; and advisories entitled Update Rollup for ActiveX Kill Bits, [Microsoft Security Advisory 953839](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/953839), [Microsoft Security Advisory 956391](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/956391), [Microsoft Security Advisory 960715](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/960715), and [Microsoft Security Advisory 969898](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/969898).

**What is a kill bit?**
A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from ever being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as setting the kill bit. After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.

For more information on kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797): How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

**What is a security update of ActiveX kill bits?**

This security update only contains the class IDs (CLSID) of certain ActiveX controls that are the basis of this security update. This security bulletin lists these CLSIDs in the Vulnerability Section.

**Why does this update not contain any binary files?**
This update only makes changes to the registry to disable the control from instantiating in Internet Explorer.

**Should I install this update if I do not have the affected component installed or use the affected platform?**
Yes. Installing this update will block the vulnerable control from running in Internet Explorer.

**Do I need to reapply this update if I install an ActiveX control discussed in this security update at a later date?**
No, reapplying this update is not required. The kill bit will block Internet Explorer from running the control even if the control is installed at a later date.

**Does this update contain any kill bits that are not Microsoft-specific?**

All new kill bits in this update apply only to a Microsoft control. However, since this is a cumulative security update, this update includes kill bits that Microsoft has issued for both Microsoft and non-Microsoft ActiveX controls.

**Does this update contain kill bits that were previously shipped in an Internet Explorer security update?**
No, this update does not include kill bits that were previously shipped in an Internet Explorer security update. We recommend that you install the latest Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.

**Why does this security update have different severity levels for different Windows operating systems?**
This update has different severity levels because different mitigations apply to the vulnerability depending on the operating system. One such mitigation is that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).

## Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Video ActiveX Control, msvidctl.dll. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0015](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0015).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Customers who are using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 are not affected because the ability to pass data to this control within Internet Explorer has been restricted.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the ActiveX objects are contained are documented under "What does the update do?" in the **FAQ for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015** section. Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in that section.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{ XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX }]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  + [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)
  + [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)
  + [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
* **Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating the ActiveX control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When the Microsoft Video ActiveX Control is instantiated in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.

**What is the Microsoft Video ActiveX Control?**

The Microsoft Video Control object is a Microsoft ActiveX control that connects Microsoft DirectShow filters for use in capturing, recording, and playing video. It is the main component that Microsoft Windows Media Center uses to build filter graphs for recording and playing television video.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008. Do I need to install this update?**

Though unaffected by this vulnerability, Microsoft is recommending that Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 customers remove support for this ActiveX Control within Internet Explorer, using the same Class Identifiers listed below, as a defense-in-depth measure.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The Microsoft Video ActiveX Control was never intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer and can therefore be disabled by setting the kill bit for the Class Identifiers hosted in msvidctl.dll:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
