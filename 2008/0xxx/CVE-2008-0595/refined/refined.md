Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2008-0595 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The D-Bus daemon incorrectly applied security policies when evaluating method calls.
- Specifically, the daemon did not properly validate the `send_interface` attribute in the policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Policy Bypass:**  The core issue was that when a method call was made with a NULL interface (i.e., not fully qualified), the D-Bus daemon would bypass the `send_interface` checks defined in the security policy.
- This meant that even if a policy had explicit restrictions using `<allow send_interface="...">`, it could be circumvented by sending a method call without specifying an interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user could potentially bypass intended security policies. By sending specially crafted D-Bus requests with a NULL interface, they could invoke methods that were meant to be restricted, leading to privilege escalation.
-  The vulnerability could allow a user to invoke non-qualified method calls defined for any interface, which was not the intended behavior of the policy.
- **Denial of Service (Indirect):**  While not the primary impact of CVE-2008-0595, one source mentions that a related vulnerability (CVE-2008-3834) involved corrupt signatures that could cause applications linked against the D-Bus library to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by local users sending specially crafted D-Bus requests to the D-Bus daemon.
- **Malformed D-Bus Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting a D-Bus method call that does not fully qualify the method call with an interface (passing a NULL interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Send D-Bus Requests:** The attacker must be able to send D-Bus requests to the D-Bus daemon (a standard capability for local users).
