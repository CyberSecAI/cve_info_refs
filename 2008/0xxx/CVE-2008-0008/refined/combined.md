How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1476-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
January 27, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pulseaudio
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0008

Marcus Meissner discovered that the PulseAudio sound server performed
insufficent checks when dropping privileges, which could lead to local
privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5-5etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain pulseaudio.

We recommend that you upgrade your pulseaudio packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# Pulseaudio: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200802-07**

A vulnerability in pulseaudio may allow a local user to execute actions
with escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/pulseaudio** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.9** |

### Background

Pulseaudio is a networked sound server with an advanced plugin system.

### Description

Marcus Meissner from SUSE reported that the pa\_drop\_root() function
does not properly check the return value of the system calls setuid(),
seteuid(), setresuid() and setreuid() when dropping its privileges.

### Impact

A local attacker could cause a resource exhaustion to make the system
calls fail, which would cause Pulseaudio to run as root. The attacker
could then perform actions with root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pulseaudio users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/pulseaudio-0.9.9"
```

I have a patch to fix the function not to ignore setuid() call. But I don't have time _right now_ to check if this is enough to make sure the server is secure.  On the other hand, I've just seen Lennart tagging the release 0.9.9 ... and I didn't see any fix for this, which makes me a bit concerned. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Diego Elio Pettenò (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-24 02:03:27 UTC  ``` Okay, the fix will be released in version 0.9.9 for which the ebuild are ready on my repository ready to be committed once the tarball is available.  Note: there will be three revisions for the 0.9.9 release:  0.9.9(-r0): this is what you want to mark stable, it's based off 0.9.8-r6; 0.9.9-r1: has to stay ~arch, it has glib as optional with an USE flag; 0.9.9-r2: has to stay package.masked, it will be the baselayout 2 version;  Please also CC bsd together with the other arches as they'll lose their highest ~arch version. for bsd, arm, sh and ppc keywording requests refer to [bug #200076](show_bug.cgi?id=200076 "RESOLVED OBSOLETE - media-sound/pulseaudio keywording request for ~x86-fbsd").  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-24 02:12:56 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =media-sound/pulseaudio-0.9.9 Target keywords : "alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 sh sparc x86 ~x86-fbsd" ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-24 04:50:58 UTC  ``` @betelgeuse,  Is this gonna cause any problems for stabling bluez-{libs,utils}-3.x?

It causes portage to ignore the "media-sound/pulseaudio policykit" entry when calculating use masks for pulseaudio-0.9.9.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

User can cause the call to fail by exhausting the resources in some cases, please add the check. Thanks!  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=347822>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=425481#c1)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-12-20 12:40:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 290146](attachment.cgi?id=290146&action=diff "Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=290146&action=edit "Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges") Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges  Lennart -- could it be done like this?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=425481#c2)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-01-23 15:15:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 292647](attachment.cgi?id=292647&action=diff "Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=292647&action=edit "Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges") Fail when it's not possible to drop root privileges   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=425481#c3)  Lennart Poettering    2008-01-24 01:24:45 UTC  ``` That patch is fine! Lubomir, thanks a lot for fixing this much faster than I could.  I have now merged a different patch into upstream SVN, because I initially wasn't aware of yours. But yours is fine, too.  <http://pulseaudio.org/changeset/2100>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=425481#c4)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-24 21:59:25 UTC  ``` pulseaudio-0.9.8-5.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
