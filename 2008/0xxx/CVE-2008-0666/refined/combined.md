How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Website META Language: Insecure temporary file usage — GLSA **200803-23**

Multiple insecure temporary file vulnerabilities have been discovered in
the Website META Language.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/wml** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.11-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.11-r3** |

### Background

### Description

Temporary files are handled insecurely in the files
wml\_backend/p1\_ipp/ipp.src, wml\_contrib/wmg.cgi, and
wml\_backend/p3\_eperl/eperl\_sys.c, allowing users to overwrite or delete
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the program.

### Impact

Local users can exploit the insecure temporary file vulnerabilities via
symlink attacks to perform certain actions with escalated privileges.

### Workaround

Restrict access to the temporary directory to trusted users only.

### Resolution

All Website META Language users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/wml-2.0.11-r3"
```

Package        : wml
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0665 CVE-2008-0666
Debian Bug     : 463907

Frank Lichtenheld and Nico Golde discovered that WML, an off-line HTML
generation toolkit, creates insecure temporary files in the eperl and
ipp backends and in the wmg.cgi script, which could lead to local denial
of service by overwriting files.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.

We recommend that you upgrade your wml packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 4.0 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Creates tempfiles in a unsafe way
Date: Mon, 04 Feb 2008 05:53:47 +0100
```
Package: wml
Version: 2.0.11-1
Severity: serious
Tags: security

The following code in wml_backend/p1_ipp/ipp.src is obviously unsafe
(and actually causing practical problems during the Debian website
build):

$tmpdir = $ENV{'TMPDIR'} || '/tmp';
$tmpfile = $tmpdir . "/ipp.$$.tmp";
unlink($tmpfile);
$tmp = new IO::File;
$tmp->open(">$tmpfile") || error("cannot write into $tmpfile: $!");

Sadly enough this was fixed by the former maintainer for sarge but
apparently got lost when the new upstream was packaged for etch. See
the following code in sarge's version:

my $tmpldir = ($ENV{'TMPDIR'} || '/tmp') . '/ipp.XXXXXX';
$tmpdir = mkdtemp($tmpldir) or die "Unable to create temporary directory: $!\n";
$tmpfile = $tmpdir . "/ipp.$$.tmp";
unlink($tmpfile);
$tmp = new IO::File;
$tmp->open(">$tmpfile") || error("cannot write into $tmpfile: $!");

You could probably just use that again.

Gruesse,
	Frank Lichtenheld

	Just for the record, there is a new version of wml that
should be packaged, I will take care to properly keep this fix
if it is not present upstream. Would you like me to prepare a
package to fix this? Or should I wait for Debian Security Team?
I'm OK with a NMU.

	As soon as possible, I will work on the new package and
also to clean up the BTS for wml. Sorry for the delay.

Kind regards,

I tried to catch you up in #debian-security but you didn't
join for some days :)

If you can upload a fix before tomorrow do it, otherwise
I'll take care of this tomorrow.

Hi,
I found a similar issue in wml_contrib/wmg.cgi which we also install in our
package:

 369             $tmpfile = "/tmp/pe.tmp.$$";
 370             unlink($tmpfile);
 371             open(TMP, ">$tmpfile");
 372             print TMP $contents;
 373             close(TMP);
 374             open(TMP, "<$tmpfile");
 375             $tmpimg = newFromGif GD::Image(TMP);
 376             close(TMP);
 377             unlink($tmpfile);

And one in wml_backend/p3_eperl/eperl_sys.c:
210 char *mytmpfile(char *id)
211 {
212     char ca[1024];
213     char *cp, *tmpdir;
214     int i;
215
216     tmpdir = getenv ("TMPDIR");
217     if (tmpdir == (char *) NULL)
218         tmpdir="/tmp";
219
220     snprintf(ca, sizeof(ca), "%s/%s.%d.tmp%d", tmpdir, id, (int)getpid(), mytmpfilecnt++);
221     ca[sizeof(ca)-1] = NUL;
222     cp = strdup(ca);
223     for (i = 0; mytmpfiles[i] != NULL; i++)
224         ;
225     mytmpfiles[i++] = cp;
226     mytmpfiles[i] = NULL;
227     return cp;
228 }

I am going to fix this using mkstemp, however the fix won't
be race free because ideally you also need you have to open the
file via the file descriptor returned by mkstemp to ensure
that the file did not change. For this I would need to completely
change the function and I don't want to do such an intrusive change.
However this is not a big issue and more theoretical but should be
fixed by upstream later.

I am going to fix this as well.

Kind regards
Nico

Args,
ignore the second NMU patch, using bug numbers out of your

Hi,

Nicos patch of ipp.src is not complete. It doesn't delete the created
tempdir. The attached one corrects two minor things as well (adapted
from the sarge package). I haven't looked at the changes in eperl_sys.c
but I think there exists a similar problem.

regards,

Jochen

True but calling this an incomplete patch goes a bit too far
as the security issue itself is fixed. This is a minor bug
not having any security impact.

I politely disagree cause all I did was changing the name of
the tmpfile, nothing more.
Kind regards
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
