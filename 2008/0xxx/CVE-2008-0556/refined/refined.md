  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-0556",
      "root_cause": "The OpenCA PKI application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF). The application uses session cookies for authentication, and forms used to execute activities on the CA are not protected by CSRF tokens.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can manipulate an authenticated user (e.g., a registration officer) into executing actions on the CA without their knowledge or consent, such as issuing arbitrary certificates.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker can embed malicious requests into a tag on a website or email. When a logged-in user visits this page/email, the request is executed against the vulnerable application.",
          "Specifically, the advisory mentions using an <img> tag to embed a malicious request."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a website or view an email under the attacker's control.",
        "additional_details": "The provided example shows how a crafted URL with specific parameters can be used to issue a certificate with attributes specified by the attacker. This demonstrates the ability to perform arbitrary actions on the CA through CSRF.",

        "0.9.2.5",
        "Possibly 0.9.2.x (untested)"
