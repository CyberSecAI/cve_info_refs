### Fastest fix in the West - a vendor's excellent response

Rare is the occasion when one who researches and responsibly reports web application vulnerabilities is met with an open, immediate, consumer oriented response from a vendor. But so it was when I let the folks who develop Tendenci, a Schipul offering, know about a few XSS issues. These are people who take great pride in their product; had they simply fixed the issue, and perhaps sent back a quick note many days later, I would have accepted that as the typical norm for most responsible vendors.
Yet, Schipul took the process to a new height, raising the bar entirely.
I literally heard back from Schipul's Jennifer Brooks within an hour of notification. Within 24 hours the issues had been addressed, and even more surprising, Tendenci posted the issue and its resolution to their [blog](http://blog.tendenci.com/2008/02/cross-site-scri.html), providing customers with a summary and an FAQ.
This rapid, public response exemplifies a company who seeks to protect their brand, their customers, and the end user, all in the same spirit and with the same intent.
To Schipul I say well done, extremely well done, and thank you.

Thanks Russ - as a Tendenci/Schipul team member I appreciate you 1) pointing out this vulnerability so that we could patch it up and 2) writing such a great follow-up post on top of that.

We are passionate about our software and our Users and anything that pushes us further in our goal to connect and organize the World's people is a good thing.

Thanks - Katie

Thanks Russ. It means a lot to us here at Schipul that our seriousness about security meant enough to you that you wrote a follow up post about it.

We appreciate what you do and we are so glad that you caught this vulnerability for us before it became a big issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
