Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express Backup Server service (dsmsvc.exe). This service listens on TCP port 1500 by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** The core issue is that the `dsmsvc.exe` process trusts a user-supplied length value without proper validation. This lack of bounds checking allows an attacker to provide an excessively large length value.
- **Static Heap Buffer:** The supplied length is used to copy data into a static heap buffer, which has a fixed size. When the attacker provides a length larger than this buffer, it causes a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **System User Context:** The code execution occurs in the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The service listens on a network port (TCP 1500), making it remotely exploitable.
- **User-Supplied Length:** The attacker sends a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service with an oversized length value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express instance.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication to the TSM Express Backup Server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2007-12-05, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2008-01-14.
- IBM has released an update to correct the vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID 5509.
