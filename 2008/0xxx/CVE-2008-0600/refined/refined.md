    "description": "The vmsplice system call did not properly verify address arguments passed by user space processes, which allowed local attackers to overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, gaining root privileges.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `vmsplice` system call in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the address arguments passed from user space, specifically when using `vmsplice_to_pipe`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient validation of user-supplied memory pointers in the `vmsplice` system call.",
         "Improper checks on the `len` field leading to an overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain root privileges by overwriting arbitrary kernel memory.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation using a crafted program that calls the vulnerable vmsplice syscall with malicious arguments.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have local access to the system with the ability to execute programs."

    "affected_products": [
      "Linux kernel versions 2.6.17 to 2.6.24.1 (and possibly earlier)",

        "The initial fix for CVE-2008-0010 and CVE-2008-0009 was incomplete, leading to a new CVE being assigned for the remaining vulnerability.",

         "Exploit code for this vulnerability was publicly available and actively exploited."
