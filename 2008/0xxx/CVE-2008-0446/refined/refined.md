Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `voircom.php` file of LulieBlog version 1.02, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability in the `voircom.php` script. User-supplied input (`id` parameter) is directly used within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other application data.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the server or application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `voircom.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable LulieBlog instance. No special privileges are required for this attack, it can be performed remotely.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code shows that the attacker is using a `UNION SELECT` statement combined with `concat` to extract data from the `lulieblog_parametres` table. This confirms that the attacker is trying to extract sensitive information using a SQL injection attack.

Specifically, the provided exploit code is:

`http://Sitename/voircom.php?id=-1%27union/**/select/**/0,concat(nom_parametre,0x3a,0x3a,valeur_parametre),2,3,4,5/**/from/**/lulieblog_parametres/*`

This code attempts to bypass the initial query with `-1'`, then uses `UNION SELECT` to inject their own SQL query.
*   `-1%27`:  Likely to cause the initial query to return no results, ensuring the `UNION SELECT` results are shown. The `%27` is URL encoded single quote.
*   `union/**/select/**/`: Starts the SQL injection. The `/**/` are used as comment delimiters in some SQL databases and act as spaces that also bypass simple filtering.
*   `0,concat(nom_parametre,0x3a,0x3a,valeur_parametre),2,3,4,5`: Specifies that the attacker is trying to retrieve the content of the `nom_parametre` and `valeur_parametre` columns, concatenating them with `::`. The additional numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 are to match the number of columns in the original query.
*   `from/**/lulieblog_parametres`: Specifies the target table to extract the information from.

The attacker effectively uses a SQL injection to extract data from the database.
