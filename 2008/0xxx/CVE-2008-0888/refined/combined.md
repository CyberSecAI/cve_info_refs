1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- unzip crash due to uninitialized memory
Specially crafted files could lead unzip into using uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-0888)
unzip updates have been released for all distributions.
- tomcat security updates
Tomcat was updated to improve the list of supported SSL ciphers
(CVE-2007-1858) and to fix cross site scripting bugs (CVE-2007-2449).
tomcat5,tomcat55,apache2-mod\_jk were updated for all affected SUSE
Linux distributions.
- moodle smarty code injection problem
A bug in the smarty version contained in moodle could be exploited
by attackers to execute arbitrary php code (CVE-2008-1066).
moodle is contained on openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- xine sdpplin\_parse problem
This update fixes a bug in the function sdpplin\_parse() that
allowed remote attackers to access process memory out-of a buffers
bound. This vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code
remotely if successfully exploited. (CVE-2008-0073)
Xine was updated for all affected distributions.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- Sun Java current release
Sun has updated Sun Java 1.4 to update 17, Sun Java 1.5 to update
15, and Sun Java 6 to update 5.
These Sun Java updates are currently tested in QA.
- Apache2 and Apache roll-up security release
We are currently testing a roll-up of all pending Apache2 and
Apache security issues. A separate advisory will be published once
we release those updates.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

##### 3. Problem description:

a. VMware Tools Local Privilege Escalation on Windows-based guest OS

The VMware Tools Package provides support required for shared folders
(HGFS) and other features.

An input validation error is present in the Windows-based VMware
HGFS.sys driver. Exploitation of this flaw might result in
arbitrary code execution on the guest system by an unprivileged
guest user. It doesn't matter on what host the Windows guest OS
is running, as this is a guest driver vulnerability and not a
vulnerability on the host.

The HGFS.sys driver is present in the guest operating system if the
VMware Tools package is loaded. Even if the host has HGFS disabled
and has no shared folders, Windows-based guests may be affected. This
is regardless if a host supports HGFS.

This issue could be mitigated by removing the VMware Tools package
from Windows based guests. However this is not recommended as it
would impact usability of the product.

NOTE: Installing the new hosted release or ESX patches will not
remediate the issue. The VMware Tools packages will need
to be updated on each Windows-based guest followed by a
reboot of the guest system.

VMware would like to thank iDefense and Stephen Fewer of Harmony
Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5671 to this issue.

b. Privilege escalation on ESX or Linux based hosted operating systems

This update fixes a security issue related to local exploitation of
an untrusted library path vulnerability in vmware-authd. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and
the ability to execute the set-uid vmware-authd binary on an affected
system. Exploitation of this flaw might result in arbitrary code
execution on the Linux host system by an unprivileged user.

VMware would like to thank iDefense for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0967 to this issue.

c. Openwsman Invalid Content-Length Vulnerability

Openwsman is a system management platform that implements the Web
Services Management protocol (WS-Management). It is installed and
running by default. It is used in the VMware Management Service
Console and in ESXi.

The openwsman management service on ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 is vulnerable
to a privilege escalation vulnerability, which may allow users with
non-privileged ESX or Virtual Center accounts to gain root privileges.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need a local ESX
account or a VirtualCenter account with the Host.Cim.CimInteraction
permission.

Systems with no local ESX accounts and no VirtualCenter accounts with
the Host.Cim.CimInteraction permission are not vulnerable.

This vulnerability cannot be exploited by users without valid login
credentials.

Discovery: Alexander Sotirov, VMware Security Research

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2097 to this issue.

d. VMware VIX Application Programming Interface (API) Memory Overflow
Vulnerabilities

The VIX API (also known as "Vix") is an API that lets users write scripts
and programs to manipulate virtual machines.

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present in the VIX API.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might result in a privilege
escalation on the host system. This exploit scenario is relevant for all
affected products. On VC, ESX30x, and ESX35, users need to have the VM
Interaction Privilege in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might also result in code execution on
the host system from the guest system or on the service console in ESX Server
from the guest operating system. This exploit scenario is relevant for
Workstation 6.0.x (version 6.0.3 and below), Player 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and
below), ACE 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and below), Server 1.0.x (version 1.0.5 and
below), and ESX3.5. The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" in the VMware
configuration file must be set to true to allow for exploitation on these
products. Note that the parameter "vix-inGuest.enable" is set to false by
default.

The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" is present in the
following products:

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and higher
VMware ACE 6.0.2 and higher
VMware Server 1.06 and higher
VMware Fusion 1.1.2 and higher
ESX Server 3.0 and higher
ESX Server 3.5 and higher

In previous versions of VMware products where the VIX API was introduced,
the VIX API couldn't be disabled.

This vulnerability is present in ESX and the hosted products even if you
have not installed the VIX API. To patch your system you will need to
update to the new hosted product version or to apply the appropriate ESX
patch. It is not necessary to update the VIX API if you have installed
the VIX API.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of
Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2100 to this issue.

##### b. Security update for tcltk

An input validation flaw was discovered in Tk's GIF image handling. A
code-size value read from a GIF image was not properly validated before
being used, leading to a buffer overflow. A specially crafted GIF file
could use this to cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the
privileges of the application using the Tk graphical toolkit.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2008-0553 to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Tk's animated GIF image handling.
An animated GIF containing an initial image smaller than subsequent images
could cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the privileges of
the application using the Tk library.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2007-5378 to this issue.

A flaw first discovered in the Tcl regular expression engine used in the
PostgreSQL database server, resulted in an infinite loop when processing
certain regular expressions.

##### d. Security update for krb5

KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not set a global variable
for some krb4 message types, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via crafted messages that trigger a NULL pointer dereference
or double-free.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0062 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

The Kerberos 4 support in KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not
properly clear the unused portion of a buffer when generating an
error message, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information, aka "Uninitialized stack values."

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0063 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc\_dtablesize.c) used
by libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably
other versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h
does not define the FD\_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
triggering a large number of open file descriptors.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0948 to this issue.

# UnZip: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200804-06**

A double free vulnerability discovered in UnZip might lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/unzip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.52-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.52-r2** |

### Background

Info-ZIP's UnZip is a tool to list and extract files inside PKZIP
compressed files.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered that the NEEDBITS
macro in the inflate\_dynamic() function in the file inflate.c can be
invoked using invalid buffers, which can lead to a double free.

### Impact

Remote attackers could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted ZIP file that might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All UnZip users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unzip-5.52-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE-2008-0930
  The xwine command makes unsafe use of local temporary files when
  printing.  This could allow the removal of arbitrary files belonging
  to users who invoke the program.

CVE-2008-0931
  The xwine command changes the permissions of the global WINE configuration
  file such that it is world-writable.  This could allow local users to edit
  it such that arbitrary commands could be executed whenever any local user
  executed a program under WINE.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.1-1etch1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xwine package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
