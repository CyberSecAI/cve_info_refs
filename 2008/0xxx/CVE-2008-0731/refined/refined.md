Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the SUSE Security Announcement SUSE-SA:2008:006, which includes CVE-2008-0007 and CVE-2008-0001:

**CVE-2008-0007**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient range checks in certain fault handlers within the Linux kernel.
*   **Vulnerability:** A local attacker could exploit this to potentially read or write kernel memory.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary kernel memory read/write which can lead to privilege escalation and system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the system is required.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the local system.

**CVE-2008-0001**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect access mode checks within the Linux kernel.
*   **Vulnerability:** A local attacker can use the vulnerability to corrupt directory contents.
*  **Impact:** This can cause denial of service or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the system is required.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local system.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Mentioned in the SUSE Advisory (Not Directly Related to the CVE Provided, but Included for Context)**

The SUSE security announcement also addresses several other vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel:

*   **CVE-2007-5966:** Integer overflow in the `hrtimer_start` function, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
*  **CVE-2007-3843:** Incorrect global variable check for CIFS sec mount option potentially allowing spoofing of CIFS network traffic.
*  **CVE-2007-2242:** Denial of service via crafted IPv6 type 0 route headers.
*  **CVE-2007-6417:** Improper memory clearing in `shmem_getpage` function, allowing local users to read sensitive kernel data or cause a denial of service.
*  **CVE-2007-4308:** Inadequate permission checks in SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid, allowing local users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges.
*  **CVE-2007-3740:** CIFS filesystem ignores umask of a process, allowing local users to gain privileges.
*  **CVE-2007-3848:** Local users can send arbitrary signals to higher-privilege child processes by killing a setuid-root parent process.
*   **CVE-2007-4997:** Integer underflow in the `ieee80211_rx` function, leading to a denial of service.
*   **CVE-2007-6063:** Buffer overflow in the `isdn_net_setcfg` function, allowing local users to have an unknown impact.
*   A failed AppArmor `change_hat` system call can result in an apparmored task becoming unconfined.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerabilities affect multiple SUSE and openSUSE distributions including:

* SUSE Linux 10.1
* openSUSE 10.2
* openSUSE 10.3
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP1
* SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 DEBUGINFO
* SLE SDK 10 SP1
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1

**Solution:**
The recommended solution is to install the provided kernel update packages and reboot the system.
