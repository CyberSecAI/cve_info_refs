Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0480:

**Verification:**
The content from exploit-db.com and bugreport.ir directly reference CVE-2008-0480. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `FolderName` parameter within the `RTE_file_browser.asp` and `file_browser.asp` files in Web Wiz Forums. Specifically, the application does not properly handle directory traversal sequences within the parameter.
- Additionally, the `RTE_file_browser.asp` file does not require user authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use sequences like `../` or `..\` to navigate outside the intended directory structure.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The `RTE_file_browser.asp` script can be accessed without authentication, allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can list arbitrary directories on the server.
- An attacker can list arbitrary files with extensions such as `.txt` and `.zip`.
- This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, as an attacker can potentially access configuration files, source code, or other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable `RTE_file_browser.asp` or `file_browser.asp` files.
- The attacker modifies the `sub` parameter within the URL to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `?sub=\.....\\\.....\\\.....\\\`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Web Wiz Forums installation.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability in `RTE_file_browser.asp`.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content also includes a suggested fix which involves adding additional sanitization to the `strSubFolderName` variable to handle forward slashes (`/`), double backslashes (`\\`), and double dots (`..`).
```
	strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "/", "\", 1, -1, 1)
	strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "\\", "\", 1, -1, 1)
	strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "..", "", 1, -1, 1)
```
