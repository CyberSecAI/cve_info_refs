      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_ac17d6b3_20250125_121521.html",
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in UltraVNC Viewer 1.0.2 when handling specific minor protocol versions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The client reads a 32-bit integer from the TCP stream, which is used as a trusted size for reading data into a fixed-size 1024-byte buffer on the stack.",
         "Lack of proper bounds checking when reading data from the TCP stream into a fixed-size buffer."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the client machine.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious VNC server can send a crafted response with a specific minor protocol version (14 or 16) to trigger the vulnerability.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious VNC server and trick the user into connecting with the vulnerable UltraVNC viewer."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient bounds checking when processing received packets during the protocol negotiation phase of a VNC session"
