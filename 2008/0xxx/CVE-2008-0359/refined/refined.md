Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0359:

**CVE Description:** The provided description is a placeholder. However, the exploit-db content shows that this CVE is associated with BlogCMS 4.2.1b

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in multiple parameters leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `blogid` parameter in `index.php` and the `user` parameter in `action.php` are vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient input sanitization in `photo/admin.php` and `photo/index.php` allows injection of XSS scripts via URLs. Additionally, SQL injection errors can be exploited to achieve reflected XSS (SiXSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   SiXSS (XSS through SQL Injection Error)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database.
*  **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **SiXSS:** Attackers can inject XSS code into SQL error messages, which can be rendered in the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL queries in the `blogid` parameter in the `index.php` URL, and through the `user` POST parameter in `action.php`.
*   **XSS:** By injecting XSS payloads via the URL in `photo/admin.php` and `photo/index.php`.
*   **SiXSS:** By injecting XSS payloads into parameters like `blogid` in `index.php`, or `field` in `admin/plugins/table/index.php` to trigger SQL errors that include the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable BlogCMS server.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely, requiring only network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
* The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of vulnerable URLs and POST requests.
* The vendor released Blogcms 4.2.1.c to address these vulnerabilities.
* The advisory highlights that the SiXSS in the admin panel is considered less critical.
