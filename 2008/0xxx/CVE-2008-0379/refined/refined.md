- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs in the `EnterpriseControls.dll` when using the `SelectedSession()` method due to a race condition during component initialization. This overwrites the EIP register.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates crashing the application by overwriting the EIP register with arbitrary data.
    - Remote Code Execution: By patching 4 bytes in the DLL, it's possible to control the EIP register and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack is triggered by a web page containing the CLSID of the vulnerable ActiveX component and the codebase path to a crafted ActiveX. The vulnerability is exploited through the `SelectedSession()` method of the component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and have the victim visit it with a vulnerable Crystal Reports installation.
    -  For remote code execution, the attacker needs to be able to create a modified DLL.
