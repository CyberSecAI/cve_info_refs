Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `Download.php` script within XPWeb 3.3.2. Specifically, the script processes the `url` parameter without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the parameter to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to remotely disclose files on the server by manipulating the `url` parameter in `Download.php`. This is due to a lack of input validation or sanitization.
- **Path Traversal:** The provided proof of concept shows that path traversal using `../` sequences is possible, allowing access to files outside of the intended web directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files (`Config.inc.php`), system files (`/etc/passwd`), or any file that the web server process has access to. This can lead to further compromise of the application and potentially the server itself.
- **Compromise of sensitive information:** Exposure of files such as `Config.inc.php` can reveal database passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to `Download.php` with a malicious `url` parameter.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `url` parameter to point to the file that they want to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to have remote access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit-db entry provides two Proof of Concepts:
  -  `/XPWeb_v3.3.2/Download.php?url=Config.inc.php` to access the configuration file.
  - `/XPWeb_v3.3.2/Download.php?url=../../../../../../../etc/passwd` to access a system file.
- The exploit-db entry also provides dorks to help find potentially vulnerable sites:
  - `intitle:XPWeb 3.3.2`
  - `intitle:XPWeb 3.0.1`
