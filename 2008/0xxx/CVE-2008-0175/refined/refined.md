Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A faulty Java RMI call associated with the "Add WebSource" feature in GE Fanuc Proficy Information Portal 2.6. This allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files, including executable server-side scripts, to the main virtual directory of the web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and restrictions when using the "Add WebSource" feature. This allows any authenticated user to upload any file type to the web server's directory.
- **Unrestricted File Placement:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify the name and path of the uploaded file, giving the attacker direct control of where the file is placed on the server file system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application does not sufficiently validate or sanitize the file content uploaded. Specifically, it does not check for malicious file types that the server could execute.
- **Missing Access Control:** The "Add WebSource" functionality is available to any authenticated user instead of limiting it to specific roles or access levels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and executing a server-side script (e.g., ASP), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to the compromise of the server running Proficy Information Portal.
- **Access to SCADA Networks:** Given that Proficy Information Portal is often installed in a buffer zone between SCADA and corporate networks, exploitation can allow an attacker to move from the compromised system to the SCADA/process network.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The attack allows for partial loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely through the web interface of the application.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Proficy Information Portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Proficy Information Portal.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the application.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to upload a file using the "Add WebSource" feature and to prepare a malicious file such as an ASP shell.
