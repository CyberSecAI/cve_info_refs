How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Testimonials

Let me first say one thing to you guys .. Using your software i have built my business from next to nothing into something so huge and successful. I have made a lil extra cash and moved into webhosting and a few other great projects happening soon. I don’t get a chance to use your forums as much as I use to but that’s probably more due to the fact the site is so stable and I haven’t had any major problems.

**Nin**

I’ve had this product for only a few weeks and it is the best out there. The ease of install is simple, the service is unprecidented, the ability to tweak and develop it is awesome. Well done CandyPress, I’m your number one fan and supporter.

**PJ**

Like any worthwhile relationship, a customer-vendor affiliation brings together ideas and common goals. Striking the delicate balance between likes and dislikes can sometimes be difficult. Two traits I hold in high regard personally and professionally are integrity and respect. Consequently, I am compelled to tell you that working with you is an absolute pleasure. Everything is upbeat and up-front. Business is tough, but not with people like you. Thanks for your support and wonderful product.

 **T.S.G.**

CandyPress made setting up payments in our dating app a breeze! We’ve tried other solutions in the past, and none have ever been as easy to implement. The support team is super friendly and helpful as well. Thanks CandyPress!
