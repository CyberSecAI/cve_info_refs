Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the `private.php` file of MyBB (MyBulletinBoard) version 1.2.11 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into a SQL query. Specifically, the `options[disablesmilies]` parameter within the private messaging functionality was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Extraction:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords (including salts), email addresses, user groups, additional groups, website, and registration IPs.
*   **Potential for Wider Compromise:**  While this specific exploit focuses on data extraction, a successful SQL injection can often lead to more severe consequences depending on database permissions and the application's design. This could include data manipulation or even code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `private.php` file.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The `options[disablesmilies]` parameter contains the injected SQL code. This is embedded as part of a new message payload
*   The exploit attempts to bypass the 5 minute message limit by generating a random message to each recipient.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the MyBB forum.
*   **Login Credentials:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to authenticate and send private messages.
*   **Target User ID:** While the provided exploit script can retrieve user information for a specified range of user IDs, it initially requires knowledge of a user ID for the attack to function.

**Additional Details from Provided Content:**

*   **Exploit Script:** A Perl exploit script is provided demonstrating the vulnerability. It automates the process of logging in, crafting the malicious SQL payload, sending a private message, and extracting the leaked user data, by using a concat function with ifnull to gather all user information into a single string, and using a custom delimiter to later parse.
*   **Patch Information:** MyBB 1.2.12 was released to address this vulnerability, along with other issues.
*   **Vulnerable Files:** The patch includes changes to `inc/datahandlers/pm.php` and `private.php` among other files to mitigate the exploit.

**Summary:**

CVE-2008-0787 is a serious SQL Injection vulnerability that affects MyBB 1.2.11 and prior versions. By exploiting a flaw in the private messaging system, a registered user can extract sensitive user data from the forum's database. The exploit can be easily automated using a tool like the provided Perl script. Applying the provided patches or upgrading to MyBB 1.2.12 is highly recommended.
