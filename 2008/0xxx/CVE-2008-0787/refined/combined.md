##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

MyBB 1.2.12 is a security update to MyBB 1.2 fixing a HIGH SQL Injection and MEDIUM XSRF vulnerabilities. Because of the amount of changes in this release we've decided to go ahead and include fixes for some outstanding bugs. We recommend everybody upgrades to this release immediately.  This security update fixes:  * [HIGH RISK] SQL Injection vulnerability in inc/datahandlers/pm.php * [MEDIUM RISK] XSRF vulnerabilities in various files (Note: Most require the user to have a moderator account)   These vulnerabilities affect MyBB 1.2.11 and previous releases of MyBB 1.2. Older versions of MyBB may also be affected.  MyBB 1.2.11 to MyBB 1.2.12 Patch This patch is only for users running MyBB 1.2.11. If you are running any other version of the MyBB 1.2 series then please download MyBB 1.2.12 from the MyBB site and update to it.  Please download the attached ZIP archive and replace the files in your forum directory with those from the ZIP archive.    .zip   [mybb\_1212\_changed\_files.zip](attachment.php?aid=8467 "2008-01-21, 01:18 AM") (Size: 309.54 KB / Downloads: 5,447)   Information on upgrading, template changes and language changes can be found in the posts below.  Please note, that you need to run the upgrade script for this version. This is so the templates may be updated.  There are no database schema changes in this version.   Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.  As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybboard.net/contact/) page.

Upgrading from the 1.2 series When upgrading from 1.2, you will not lose any custom themes, plugins or language packs which you may have installed.  Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.  Upgrading from other versions If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2 then you will lose your custom themes, templates and language packs due to the number of changes between your version and the 1.2 series.  Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board. This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.  Follow the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") *(Broken link, head over to docs.mybb.com instead)* guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.

Because the only template changes are security fixes, the upgrader automatically applies the changes.  Language file changes Since MyBB 1.2.10 the following language files have had changes to them:  * global.lang.php  Either update your language packs to include the changes in these files or revert to the standard English language pack.  Plugins Most of your MyBB 1.2.x plugins will work correctly with 1.2.12 without any updates.
