```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An integer overflow occurs due to improper handling of certain types of XDR requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Integer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker could send specially crafted XDR requests to the vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
Sending specially crafted XDR requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
