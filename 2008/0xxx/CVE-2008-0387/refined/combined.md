How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Firebird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Firebird may allow the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/firebird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.3.12981.0-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.3.12981.0-r5** |

### Background

Firebird is a multi-platform, open source relational database.

### Description

Firebird does not properly handle certain types of XDR requests,
resulting in an integer overflow (CVE-2008-0387). Furthermore, it is
vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing usernames
(CVE-2008-0467).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted XDR requests or an
overly long username to the vulnerable server, possibly resulting in
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/firebird-2.0.3.12981.0-r5"
```

Debian Bug(s)  : 362001 432753 444976 441405 460048 463596

Multiple security problems have been discovered in the Firebird database,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

This Debian security advisory is a bit unusual. While it's normally
our strict policy to backport security bugfixes to older releases, this
turned out to be infeasible for Firebird 1.5 due to large infrastructural
changes necessary to fix these issues. As a consequence security support
for Firebird 1.5 is hereby discontinued, leaving two options to
administrators running a Firebird database:

I.  Administrators running Firebird in a completely internal setup with
    trusted users could leave it unchanged.

II. Everyone else should upgrade to the firebird2.0 packages available at
    <http://www.backports.org/backports.org/pool/main/f/firebird2.0/>

    Version 2.0.3.12981.ds1-6~bpo40+1 fixes all known issues.

    Please refer to the general backports.org documentation to add the
    packages to your package management configuration:
    <http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions>

    These packages are backported to run with Debian stable. Since
    firebird2.0 is not a drop-in replacement for firebird2 (which
    is the source package name for the Firebird 1.5 packages)
    these updates are not released through security.debian.org.
    Potential future security problems affecting Debian stable will be
    released through backports.org as well.

    Arrangements have been made to ensure that Firebird in the upcoming
    Debian 5.0 release will be supportable with regular backported
    security bugfixes again.

For a more detailed descriptions of the security problems, please refer
to the entries in the Debian Bug Tracking System referenced above and
the following URLs:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
