  "CVE-2008-0061": {
    "Description": "MaraDNS 1.0 before 1.0.41, 1.2 before 1.2.12.08, and 1.3 before 1.3.07.04 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted DNS packet that prevents an authoritative name (CNAME) record from resolving, aka \"improper rotation of resource records.\"",
    "Root cause": "Improper rotation of resource records when processing specially crafted DNS packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in how MaraDNS handles CNAME records, specifically an issue with resource record rotation logic.",
       "The program does not properly handle resource record rotation when processing specific crafted DNS packets"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted DNS packets to a vulnerable MaraDNS server, preventing authoritative CNAME records from resolving. This means users would be unable to reach services with CNAME records.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attack vector is remote.",
      "A remote attacker sends specially crafted DNS packets to the server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "The attacker needs to be able to send DNS packets to the target server.",
      "No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
     ],
      "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability affects MaraDNS versions 1.0 prior to 1.0.41, 1.2 prior to 1.2.12.08, and 1.3 prior to 1.3.07.04.",
        "A workaround involves adding `max_ar_chain = 2` to the mararc configuration file."
