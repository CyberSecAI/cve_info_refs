Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause across these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of the `page` and `file` parameters within various WordPress files. This allows attackers to inject directory traversal sequences and file paths, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI), Directory Traversal, and Full Path Disclosure. The use of backslashes also exploits a specific weakness on Windows servers, which interprets them as directory separators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Attackers can include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `page` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `\..\..\file.php`).
2.  **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can traverse the file system to access files outside the intended directory by using sequences like `\..\..\`.
3.  **Full Path Disclosure:** By providing empty or malformed values to the `page` or `file` parameters, the application reveals the full server path of the script, which can be used for further attacks.
4.  **Arbitrary File Edit:** In `templates.php` using the `file` parameter, it's possible to achieve arbitrary file modification with directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain sensitive information about the server's file structure, configuration, and even source code by reading local files. This includes sensitive files like `.htaccess`.
*   **Code Execution:** By including specially crafted files (e.g., PHP files), attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers could modify files like .htaccess to manipulate server behavior.
*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** The ability to edit files through templates.php leads to further options to corrupt the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through HTTP GET requests, by manipulating the `page` and `file` parameters in the URL. The affected files are located within the WordPress admin directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   No authentication is required for the Full Path Disclosure vulnerabilities, as they do not require any specific role to exploit.
*   Local file inclusion and arbitrary file edit require the user to have access to the admin panel.

**Vulnerable Files (examples):**

*   `wp-admin/edit.php`
*   `wp-admin/admin.php`
*   `wp-admin/templates.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-pages.php`
*   `wp-admin/categories.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-comments.php`
*   `wp-admin/moderation.php`
*   `wp-admin/post.php`
*   `wp-admin/page-new.php`
*   `wp-admin/index.php`
*   `wp-admin/link-manager.php`
*   `wp-admin/link-add.php`
*   `wp-admin/link-categories.php`
*   `wp-admin/link-import.php`
*    And more as mentioned in the provided content

**Vulnerable Versions:**

WordPress versions <= 2.0.11 are explicitly mentioned as vulnerable, with potential vulnerabilities in later 2.1.x, 2.2.x and 2.3.x versions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The use of backslashes (`\`) as directory traversal characters is specific to Windows-based systems.
*   The provided text suggests that these vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by "MustLive" from websecurity.com.ua.
*   The content contains multiple reports referring to similar issues across several files of WordPress.
