Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `calendar.php` script of Vwar version 1.5.0. Specifically, the `month` parameter in the URL `http://[host]/vwar/calendar.php?month=[SQL]` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to sanitize user input passed through the `month` parameter in `calendar.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.
*  **Integrity Impact (Partial):** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.
*  **Availability Impact (Partial):** An attacker may be able to disrupt the normal operation of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting malicious URLs with injected SQL code in the `month` parameter.
*   **URL parameter:** The `month` parameter in the `calendar.php` script is the entry point for the injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   Knowledge of SQL and web application structure would be required to fully exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The CVSS score is 7.5/10, with an exploitability score of 10/10, highlighting the ease of exploitation.
* The content provides the vulnerable URL, which is: `http://[host]/vwar/calendar.php?month=[SQL]`.
* The vulnerability is located in the `calendar.php` script.
