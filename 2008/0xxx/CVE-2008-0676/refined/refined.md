{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper input validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords. The XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "SQL Injection": "The SQL injection vulnerability is present in the `blog.php` script through the `id` parameter in the URL. A crafted URL can bypass database sanitization and execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
    "XSS": "The XSS vulnerability is present in the `search.php` script through the `words` parameter in the URL. A crafted URL can inject malicious javascript code that will be executed by the users browser."
    },
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special access or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, besides being able to send a crafted request through a browser."
