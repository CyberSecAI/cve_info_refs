Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Windows Vista TCP/IP stack handles packets received from DHCP servers. Specifically, a specially crafted DHCP response can corrupt TCP/IP structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of IP addresses provided by a DHCP server.
- Lack of sufficient checks on the structure of DHCP packets.
- Vulnerability to crafted DHCP responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- The affected system stops responding and automatically restarts, disrupting normal operations.
- No code execution or privilege escalation is possible, but the system becomes unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious attacker must be able to act as a DHCP server, or use a DHCP relay agent, on the same network segment as the vulnerable target.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted DHCP packet to the vulnerable machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and control a malicious DHCP server or use a DHCP relay agent.
- Must be on the same local network segment as the targeted Windows Vista system to intercept DHCP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Windows Vista and Windows Vista x64 Edition. It is not present in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, or later versions like Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and newer.
- A workaround exists by manually assigning a static IP address to the client, rather than using DHCP.
- Microsoft has released a patch to address the vulnerability by implementing better validation of DHCP responses.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and no public exploit was known at the time of the bulletin.
- The researchers who found the vulnerability are from Whitestein Technologies
