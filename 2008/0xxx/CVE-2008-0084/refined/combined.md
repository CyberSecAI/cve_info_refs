How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Windows Vista TCP/IP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0084

A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP processing in Windows Vista. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted DHCP server that returns a specially crafted packet to a host, corrupting TCP/IP structures and causing the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0084](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0084).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Vista TCP/IP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0084

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker can only receive a DHCP request and respond with a specially crafted packet by using a specially crafted DHCP server within the same link or via a DHCP Relay Agent.

#### Workarounds for Windows Vista TCP/IP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0084

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Assign a static IP address to the client computer instead of allowing the client computer to automatically request an IP address. Perform the following steps:

  1. On the client computer, click **Control Panel**, then click **Network and Sharing Center**.
  2. **Local Area Connection** and click **View** **Status**.
  3. Click **Properties**.
  4. Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.
  5. Select **Use the following IP address** and enter the values in **IP address**, **Subnet mask**, **Default gateway**, and **Preferred DNS server**.
  6. Click **OK**.

  **Impact of workaround.** Automatic requests for an IP address have been bypassed.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Re-enable automatic requests for an IP address by performing the following steps:

  1. On the client computer, click **Control Panel**, then click **Network and Sharing Center** or **Network Connections**.
  2. **Local Area Connection** and click **View** **Status**.
  3. Click **Properties**.
  4. Click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** click **Properties**.
  5. Select **Obtain an IP address automatically**.
  6. Click **OK**.

#### FAQ for Windows Vista TCP/IP Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0084

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability lies in the way that the TCP/IP stack handles packets received from DHCP servers.

**What is DHCP?**

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used by networked devices (hosts) to obtain various parameters necessary for the hosts to operate in an Internet Protocol (IP) network. By using this protocol, system administration workload greatly decreases, and devices can be added to the network with minimal or no manual configurations. A DHCP server assigns IP addresses to host computers.

**What is TCP/IP? Is TCP/IP vulnerable?**

TCP/IP is the suite of communications protocols used for transmitting data over networks. The current version of TCP/IP is TCP/IPv4, which is vulnerable (see also the Workarounds section of this vulnerability entry). The next version, TCP/IPv6, is not affected by this vulnerability.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an affected system to become non-responsive and automatically restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted DHCP server that returns a specially crafted packet to a host, corrupting TCP/IP structures and causing the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows Vista clients that request an IP address from the DHCP server are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by adding more validation to the way that the TCP/IP stack handles packets received from DHCP servers.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx).

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA 2.0.1 |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Vista | See **Note for Windows** **Vista** below |
| Windows Vista x64 Edition | See **Note for Windows** **Vista** below |

**Note for Windows** **Vista** Microsoft does not support installing MBSA 2.0.1 on computers that run Windows Vista, but you may install MBSA 2.0.1 on a supported operating system and then scan the Windows Vista-based computer remotely. For additional information about MBSA support for Windows Vista, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). See also [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 931943](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/931943): Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) support for Windows Vista.

For more information about MBSA 2.0.1, see [MBSA 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsa2/qa.mspx).

**Windows Server Update Services**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 to Windows 2000 and later operating systems. For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

For more information on the support lifecycle policy, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
