  "CVE-2008-0047": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cgiCompileSearch()` function within the CUPS administration interface. This flaw is triggered when processing user-provided regular expressions, specifically within the CUPS web interface.  It allows a local attacker, and a remote attacker if printer sharing is enabled, to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running CUPS (usually lp).",
    "root_cause": "The `cgiCompileSearch()` function does not correctly calculate boundaries when processing a user-provided regular expression, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CUPS user (usually lp). Denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a malicious request containing crafted search expressions to the CUPS web interface. This can be triggered both locally and remotely if printer sharing is enabled.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the CUPS interface. Remote attackers require printer sharing to be enabled, which would allow them to send the malicious requests over the network."
