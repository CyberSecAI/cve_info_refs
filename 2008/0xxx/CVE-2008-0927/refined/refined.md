Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0927

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `dhost.exe` process in Novell eDirectory fails to properly handle multiple or malformed "Connection:" HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) due to improper parsing or handling of HTTP "Connection:" headers. Specifically, sending multiple "Connection:" headers or a single header with multiple comma-separated values can trigger the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to the `dhost.exe` process consuming 100% of a CPU core. Sending multiple such requests can lock up all available CPU cores, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the eDirectory service, specifically targeting ports TCP/8028 (HTTP) and TCP/8030 (HTTPS). The vulnerability is triggered by crafting HTTP requests with specific "Connection:" header configurations.
Two specific attack vectors mentioned are:
   - Sending two separate "Connection:" headers (e.g. `Connection: foo` and `Connection: bar`).
   - Sending one "Connection:" header with two values separated by a comma (e.g. `Connection: foo, bar`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable eDirectory instance.
- The attacker does not need authentication to the service.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Affected Versions:**
- Novell eDirectory versions prior to 8.7.3 SP10
- Novell eDirectory versions prior to 8.8.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows installations of Novell eDirectory 2000 and 2003.
- The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of how to trigger the vulnerability using `nc`.

This information provides more details than the initial CVE description placeholder, and clearly outlines the DoS attack.
