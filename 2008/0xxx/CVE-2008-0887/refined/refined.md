Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `gnome-screensaver` incorrectly handles the results of the `getpwuid()` and `getpwnam()` functions when a system uses a remote directory service like NIS or LDAP and experiences a network outage. Specifically, if the network connection to the remote directory service is lost or the server becomes unavailable, these functions can return NULL or an error that is not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Error Handling:** The core issue is that `gnome-screensaver` does not properly check for errors returned by `getpwuid()` or `getpwnam()` when used with remote authentication services. This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
- **Reliance on Network Connectivity:** The screensaver relies on the availability of the remote authentication service to validate the user credentials. When the network is unavailable, the authentication process fails, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can bypass the screen lock and gain access to a locked session without providing the correct password.
- **Screen Unlocking:** The vulnerability allows a user to unlock the screen by causing a network outage or by disconnecting the network cable, if the system is using NIS, LDAP or similar for authentication.
- **Crashing the Screensaver:** The program crashes and exits instead of properly prompting for a password. The crashing process is directly linked to the screen unlocking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Network Disruption:** The attacker needs to disrupt the network connection or make the remote directory service unavailable. This can be done by disconnecting the network cable or stopping the directory service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a local account on the system where the gnome-screensaver is running.
- **Physical Access:** The attacker may need physical access to the machine to disconnect the network cable or stop the network interface.
- **Network Manipulation:** Ability to trigger a network outage or disable the remote authentication server (NIS, LDAP).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the password verification process in gnome-screensaver.
- The issue was present in versions of `gnome-screensaver` before 2.20.0-r3.
- The vulnerability is similar to a previous vulnerability in `xscreensaver` (CVE-2007-1859).
- The vulnerability is specific to systems using remote directory services like NIS or LDAP for authentication.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `src/setuid.c` file of `gnome-screensaver`.
- The vulnerability was triggered during calls to getpwnam() in multiple files including `fusa-manager.c`, `gs-auth-pam.c`, `gs-auth-pwent.c` and `setuid.c`
- The bug can also trigger a crash in the `gnome-screensaver-dialog` process.
