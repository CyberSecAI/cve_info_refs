# gnome-screensaver: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200804-12**

gnome-screensaver allows local users to bypass authentication under certain
configurations.

### Affected packages

| Package | **gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.20.0-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.20.0-r3** |

### Background

gnome-screensaver is a screensaver, designed to integrate with the
Gnome desktop, that can replace xscreensaver.

### Description

gnome-screensaver incorrectly handles the results of the getpwuid()
function in the file src/setuid.c when using directory servers (like
NIS) during a network outage, a similar issue to GLSA 200705-14.

### Impact

A local user can crash gnome-xscreensaver by preventing network
connectivity if the system uses a remote directory service for
credentials such as NIS or LDAP, which will unlock the screen.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gnome-screensaver users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver-2.20.0-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

An updated gnome-screensaver package that fixes a security flaw is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

gnome-screensaver is the GNOME project's official screen saver program.

A flaw was found in the way gnome-screensaver verified user passwords. When
a system used a remote directory service for login credentials, a local
attacker able to cause a network outage could cause gnome-screensaver to
crash, unlocking the screen. (CVE-2008-0887)

Users of gnome-screensaver should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=435773#c0)  Alan Matsuoka    2008-03-03 19:57:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  If a RHEL5.1 GNOME desktop is locked, and the authentication method is NIS, anyone can unlock the screen with no passwd if the network connection to the NIS disappears or the NIS server is not available.  How reproducible:  Every time.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Configure machine to be NIS server per:  <http://kbase.redhat.com> /faq/FAQ_43_5684.shtm  2. Configure a NIS client using system-config-authentication  3. Login to GNOME desktop with NIS-only user.  4. Lock the screen  5. Stop the NIS server (customer disconnected network cable in his test)  6. Press return in lock window.  Press cancel.    7. Screen unlocks with no passwd prompt.  Actual results:  Broke in.  Expected results:  Screen should stay locked as there is no way to validate the user who is logged in.  Additional info:  Similar bug on RHEL4:  <https://bugzilla>. redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=237003  A similar bug was fixed on RHEL5:  * Sun Oct 15 2006 Ray Strode <rstrode> - 2.16.0-13.el5 - lock screen immediately if login security token was removed  before startup ([bug 210411](show_bug.cgi?id=210411))  Customer tested gnome-screensaver-2.16.1-6.el5 from FastTrack channel but had same results.  Log file from his gnome-screensaver session attached.    Supporting Materials: Description of how to reproduce, log from gnome-screensaver. I've reproduced this on F8 and RHEL 5.1 as well, a sosreport is currently being generated from my RHEL 5.1 guest.  More Info:ore info...  The problem might be on any of the calls to getpwnam():   File            Function              Line 0 fusa-manager.c  fusa_manager_get_user 2272 pwent = getpwnam (username); 1 gs-auth-pam.c   gs_auth_verify_user    651 pwent = getpwnam (username); 2 gs-auth-pwent.c get_encrypted_passwd   143 struct passwd *p = getpwnam                                             (user); 3 setuid.c        hack_uid               223 p = getpwnam ("nobody"); 4 setuid.c        hack_uid               224 if (! p) p = getpwnam                                             ("noaccess"); 5 setuid.c        hack_uid               225 if (! p) p = getpwnam ("daemon");  Test program gets this error: #include <sys/types.h> #include <pwd.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h>  int main(char argc, char *argv[]) {  if (!getpwnam("rickb"))        printf("error"); }  ./getpwnam do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Connection refused YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound  If NIS is down.  If those calls to getpwent() don't handle a NULL properly, we could be in trouble if the return values are undefined.  Additional info:  Problem may be that gnome-screenaver-dialog is exiting abnormally.     If you attach with gdb to this process and set a breakpoint on exit, continue, then shutdown the NIS server, you get this stack trace:  Program received signal SIGTERM, Terminated.

# XScreenSaver: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200705-14**

XScreenSaver allows local users to bypass authentication under certain
configurations.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-misc/xscreensaver** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.02** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.02** |

### Background

XScreenSaver is a widely used screen saver collection shipped on
systems running the X11 Window System.

### Description

XScreenSaver incorrectly handles the results of the getpwuid() function
in drivers/lock.c when using directory servers during a network outage.

### Impact

A local user can crash XScreenSaver by preventing network connectivity
if the system uses a remote directory service for credentials such as
NIS or LDAP, which will unlock the screen.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All XScreenSaver users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-misc/xscreensaver-5.02"
```
### References

* [CVE-2007-1859](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1859)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- sudo not flushing stdin
This update of sudo flushes the stdin buffer on password
timeout. Unflushed buffers can lead to leaking the password via a
parent process reading stdin after sudo exits.
This issue only affects openSUSE 10.3 and was fixed there.
- courier-authlib SQL injection possibility
courier-authlib was updated to fix a bug that allowed SQL
injections. (CVE-2008-2667)
Only openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 were affected.
- gnome-screensaver
Using gnome-screensaver an attacker could log in without a valid
password if the NIS server is down. (CVE-2008-0887)
gnome-screensaver was affected on SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE
Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and was fixed there.
- clamav 0.93.1
Clamav was updated to version 0.93.1. It fixes various bugs and
one minor security issue:
CVE-2008-2713: libclamav/petite.c in ClamAV before 0.93.1 allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted Petite
file that triggers an out-of-bounds read.
clamav was updated on all products containing clamav.
- PHP 5 security update
php5 was updated to fix various bugs and security problems:
- possible stack-based buffer overflow CVE-2008-2050
- incomplete escapeshellcmd() CVE-2008-2051
- printf() integer overflow CVE-2008-1384
- insecure GENERATE\_SEED macro CVE-2008-2107
- timezone update for DST in Pakistan
On openSUSE 10.2 up to 11.0 php5 was updated to 5.2.6. For SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 and SP2 the fixes were backported.
- ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick security problems
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick were affected by two security problems:
CVE-2008-1096: Buffer overflow in the handling of XCF files
CVE-2008-1097: Heap buffer overflow in the handling of PCX files
ImageMagick was updated on all products. GraphicsMagick is only
found on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0 and was updated there.
- mtr potential remote overflow
MTR was updated to fix a stack based buffer overflow which could
potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2008-2357).
mtr was updated on all SUSE Linux based products.
- bind root zone update
The IP number for the "L" root DNS server changed.
This patch updates the root.hint zone file to get the new IP number.
This is only security related and not a true vulnerability since the
old server is still operating correctly.
- pcre buffer overflow
Specially crafted regular expressions could lead to a buffer overflow
in the pcre library. Applications using pcre to process regular
expressions from untrusted sources could therefore potentially be
exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-2371).
Only the pcre version on openSUSE 10.3 was affected by this problem
and received fixed packages.
- tomcat55 and tomcat6 cross site scripting problem
tomcat was updated to fix a cross-site-scripting vulnerability in
the host-manager. (CVE-2008-1947)
Since the problem only affects tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6 only those
were fixed in openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0. Other products were not
affected.
- squid denial of service problem in ASN.1 parsing
Squid was updated to fix an old denial-of-service bug that can
occur while parsing ASN.1 data. (CVE-2004-0918)
More details can be found on:
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2008_1.txt>
Only Squid 3.0 was affected, which is only on openSUSE 11.0 and
was fixed there.
- freetype2 various integer overflows
This update of freetype2 fixes several potential vulnerabilities
reported by iDefense.
CVE-2008-1806: Integer overflow in FreeType2 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted set of 16-bit
length values within the Private dictionary table in a Printer Font
Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
CVE-2008-1807: FreeType2 allow context-dependent attackers to execute
arbitrary code via an invalid "number of axes" field in a Printer
Font Binary (PFB) file, which triggers a free of arbitrary memory
locations, leading to memory corruption.
CVE-2008-1808: Multiple off-by-one errors in FreeType2 before 2.3.6
allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
(1) a crafted table in a Printer Font Binary (PFB) file or (2)
a crafted SHC instruction in a TrueType Font (TTF) file, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Freetype2 was updated on all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=435773#c0)  Alan Matsuoka    2008-03-03 19:57:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  If a RHEL5.1 GNOME desktop is locked, and the authentication method is NIS, anyone can unlock the screen with no passwd if the network connection to the NIS disappears or the NIS server is not available.  How reproducible:  Every time.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Configure machine to be NIS server per:  <http://kbase.redhat.com> /faq/FAQ_43_5684.shtm  2. Configure a NIS client using system-config-authentication  3. Login to GNOME desktop with NIS-only user.  4. Lock the screen  5. Stop the NIS server (customer disconnected network cable in his test)  6. Press return in lock window.  Press cancel.    7. Screen unlocks with no passwd prompt.  Actual results:  Broke in.  Expected results:  Screen should stay locked as there is no way to validate the user who is logged in.  Additional info:  Similar bug on RHEL4:  <https://bugzilla>. redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=237003  A similar bug was fixed on RHEL5:  * Sun Oct 15 2006 Ray Strode <rstrode> - 2.16.0-13.el5 - lock screen immediately if login security token was removed  before startup ([bug 210411](show_bug.cgi?id=210411))  Customer tested gnome-screensaver-2.16.1-6.el5 from FastTrack channel but had same results.  Log file from his gnome-screensaver session attached.    Supporting Materials: Description of how to reproduce, log from gnome-screensaver. I've reproduced this on F8 and RHEL 5.1 as well, a sosreport is currently being generated from my RHEL 5.1 guest.  More Info:ore info...  The problem might be on any of the calls to getpwnam():   File            Function              Line 0 fusa-manager.c  fusa_manager_get_user 2272 pwent = getpwnam (username); 1 gs-auth-pam.c   gs_auth_verify_user    651 pwent = getpwnam (username); 2 gs-auth-pwent.c get_encrypted_passwd   143 struct passwd *p = getpwnam                                             (user); 3 setuid.c        hack_uid               223 p = getpwnam ("nobody"); 4 setuid.c        hack_uid               224 if (! p) p = getpwnam                                             ("noaccess"); 5 setuid.c        hack_uid               225 if (! p) p = getpwnam ("daemon");  Test program gets this error: #include <sys/types.h> #include <pwd.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h>  int main(char argc, char *argv[]) {  if (!getpwnam("rickb"))        printf("error"); }  ./getpwnam do_ypcall: clnt_call: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Connection refused YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound  If NIS is down.  If those calls to getpwent() don't handle a NULL properly, we could be in trouble if the return values are undefined.  Additional info:  Problem may be that gnome-screenaver-dialog is exiting abnormally.     If you attach with gdb to this process and set a breakpoint on exit, continue, then shutdown the NIS server, you get this stack trace:  Program received signal SIGTERM, Terminated.

If the network drops between login and the time that the screensaver starts (or anytime it restarts) it won't lock the screen.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [gnome-screensaver](/security/cves?package=gnome-screensaver) -

## Details

It was discovered that the notify feature in gnome-screensaver could let

a local attacker read the clipboard contents of a locked session by

using Ctrl-V. ([CVE-2007-6389](/security/CVE-2007-6389))

Alan Matsuoka discovered that gnome-screensaver did not properly handle

network outages when using a remote authentication service. During a

network interruption, or by disconnecting the network cable, a local

attacker could gain access to locked sessions. ([CVE-2008-0887](/security/CVE-2008-0887))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [gnome-screensaver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver)
  -
  [2.20.0-0ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver/2.20.0-0ubuntu4.3)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [gnome-screensaver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver)
  -
  [2.14.3-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver/2.14.3-0ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart all user sessions on

your computer to effect the necessary changes.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
