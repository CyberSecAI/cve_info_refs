The provided content relates to CVE-2008-0206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Captcha! WordPress plugin versions 2.5d and earlier are vulnerable to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in certain plugin options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent XSS vulnerabilities in the plugin's options page parameters: `captcha_ttffolder`, `captcha_numchars`, `captcha_ttfrange`, and `captcha_secret`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code would be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the vulnerable WordPress administration panel.
- This could lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection of users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack requires the attacker to send a POST request to the plugin's options script.
- The malicious payloads are injected via the vulnerable parameters mentioned above (`captcha_ttffolder`, `captcha_numchars`, `captcha_ttfrange`, `captcha_secret`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the WordPress plugin's options script.
- No special privileges are needed beyond being able to access the WordPress admin panel (likely with sufficient permissions to change settings)
