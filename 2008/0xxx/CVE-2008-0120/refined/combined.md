### [The Cyber Dimension of the Zaporizhzhia NPP Occupation](https://www.reversemode.com/2025/01/the-cyber-dimension-of-zaporizhzhia-npp.html)

[January 22, 2025](https://www.reversemode.com/2025/01/the-cyber-dimension-of-zaporizhzhia-npp.html "permanent link")

The war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a series of unprecedented nuclear-related situations. During the first 48 hours, Chernobyl—a symbol of the deep-seated fear of nuclear disaster, especially within Europe—was taken by Russian troops. This was accompanied by reports of  radiation spikes, various plots involving dirty bombs and nuclear materials, and Russian soldiers allegedly killed by acute radiation syndrome. In the end, all of it was proven to be as fictitious as the reported radiation levels. We should view these mutual accusations between Ukraine and Russia as part of the information war, which likely didn’t come as a complete surprise to those in the know. For instance, in an insightful piece Politico published documenting the 'first-ever oral history of how top U.S. and Western officials saw the warning signs of a European land war,' John Kirby stated the following: Without time to recover from the shock caused by the events ...

### [Addressing the Exploitation of Radiation Fear: A Self-Assessment Guide to Counter Disinformation](https://www.reversemode.com/2025/01/addressing-exploitation-of-radiation.html)

[January 08, 2025](https://www.reversemode.com/2025/01/addressing-exploitation-of-radiation.html "permanent link")

In December 2024, two events —drone sightings in the US and Israel’s strike on Syria’s weapon depots— were followed by orchestrated reports of detected radiation spikes. Some media outlets took these dubious reports (with millions of views) that originated from social media , and published pieces based on them. In one of these cases, the actors behind the disinformation campaign exploited a real-time radiation map, which is maintained by a private company  that manufactures personal dosimeters, to sustain the narrative. Kim Zetter has recently published " Anatomy of a Nuclear Scare ", an article that covers this issue. This trend does not come as a surprise, as radioactivity is one of those few things that can collectively trigger significant levels of societal anxiety and emotional, rather than rational, response, which is often disproportionate to the actual physical risks it poses. This radiation fear has been shaped during years by a mix of cultural, historical, and media...

### [A Practical Analysis of Cyber-Physical Attacks Against Nuclear Reactors](https://www.reversemode.com/2024/10/a-practical-analysis-of-cyber-physical.html)

[October 01, 2024](https://www.reversemode.com/2024/10/a-practical-analysis-of-cyber-physical.html "permanent link")

A year ago, shortly after presenting the Chernobyl research , I was kind of surprised to find out that a plethora of brand-new Teleperm XS (2nd generation) components were available on eBay.   Framatome’s Teleperm XS  (TXS) is a digital Instrumentation & Control platform designed specifically for use in safety systems in Nuclear power plants, as a replacement for, or upgrades to their analog counterparts. It is one of the most widely used digital safety I&C platforms, sustaining the main defense line (Reactor Protection System, Engineered Safety Features Actuation System) in dozens of nuclear reactors globally, including Europe, USA, Russia, and China. Obviously, that was a good opportunity to dig deeper into the, usually, closed world of nuclear digital safety I&C systems, so I bought some of the most important TXS modules.  That was the starting point for the research I'm releasing today: " A Practical Analysis of Cyber-Physical Attacks Against Nuclear ...

### [Ukraine's nuclear regulator confirms Chernobyl's post-invasion radiation spikes had an 'abnormal origin'.](https://www.reversemode.com/2024/06/ukraines-nuclear-regulator-confirms.html)

[June 05, 2024](https://www.reversemode.com/2024/06/ukraines-nuclear-regulator-confirms.html "permanent link")

First off I would like to provide some context for those readers who are not familiar with this topic. In 2023 I presented at BlackHat USA ' Seeing Through the Invisible: Radiation Spikes Detected in Chernobyl During the Russian Invasion Show Possible Evidence of Fabrication '. Kim Zetter also wrote an investigative  piece . The research materials are publicly available. As I casually discovered a few days ago, around the date I received  the acceptance notification from BlackHat, the paper ' Preliminary assessment of the radiological consequences of the hostile military occupation of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone ' was submitted to the 'Journal of Radiological Protection'. This paper would be eventually approved and then published in September. So it seems that both investigations were being performed in parallel, but unfortunately we never crossed our paths. There is also a significant detail: this investigation doesn't come from a random guy like me, but ...

------ Update 03/12/2022 Reuters has published new information on this incident, which initially matches the proposed scenario. You can find the  update  at the bottom of this post. ------ February 24th: at the same time Russia initiated a full-scale attack on Ukraine, tens of thousands of KA-SAT SATCOM terminals suddenly  stopped  working in several european countries: Germany, Ukraine, Greece, Hungary, Poland...Germany's Enercon moved forward and acknowledged that approximately 5800 of its wind turbines, presumably those remotely operated via a SATCOM link in central Europe, had lost contact with their  SCADA server .  In the affected countries, a significant part of the customers of Eutelsat's domestic broadband service were also unable to access Internet.  From the very beginning Eutelsat and its parent company Viasat, stated that the issue was being investigated as a cyberattack. Since then, details have been scarcely provided but few days ago I ...

  -------------- Update from 06/10/2023 : following my publication, I’ve been in contact with France Identité CISO and they could provide more information on the measures they have taken in the light of these findings: We would like to thank you for your in-depth technical research work on “France Identite” app that was launched in beta a year ago and for which you were rewarded. As you know, the app is now generally available on iOS and Android through their respective app stores. Your work, alongside French cybersecurity agency (ANSSI) research, made us update and modify deeply the E2EE Secure Channel used between the app and our backend. It is now mostly based on TLS1.3. Those modifications were released only a few weeks after you submitted your work through our private BugBounty program with YesWeHack. That released version also fixes the three other vulnerabilities you submitted. From the beginning of “France Identite” program, it was decided to implicate cybersecurity communi...

### [VIASAT incident: from speculation to technical details.](https://www.reversemode.com/2022/03/viasat-incident-from-speculation-to.html)

[March 31, 2022](https://www.reversemode.com/2022/03/viasat-incident-from-speculation-to.html "permanent link")

  34 days after the incident, yesterday Viasat published a statement providing some technical details about the attack that affected tens of thousands of its SATCOM terminals. Also yesterday, I eventually had access to two Surfbeam2 modems: one was targeted during the attack and the other was in a working condition. Thank you so much to the person who disinterestedly donated the attacked modem. I've been closely covering this issue since the beginning, providing a  plausible theory based on the information that was available at that time, and my experience in this field. Actually, it seems that this theory was pretty close to what really happened. Fortunately, now we can move from just pure speculation into something more tangible, so I dumped the flash memory for both modems (Spansion S29GL256P90TFCR2 ) and the differences were pretty clear. In the following picture you can see 'attacked1.bin', which belongs to the targeted modem and 'fw\_fixed.bin', coming from t...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-051 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (949785)

Published: August 12, 2008 | Updated: September 10, 2008

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint and Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint allocates memory when opening PowerPoint files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/949785) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update, and recommended solutions. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, the article provides links to further articles.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on September 10, 2008?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to add Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2005 client and Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007 client to the list of non-affected software.

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 20, 2008?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to note that new update packages have been posted to the Microsoft Download Center for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3. The bulletin has also been revised to remove erroneous mitigations from the vulnerability information sections for Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0120 and Memory Calculation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0121.

**How do I know whether I have the latest version of the update for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3 installed on my system?**

Customers can check the file version of powerpnt.exe on their systems to determine whether the latest version of the update is installed. Customers with version 11.0.8227.0 of powerpnt.exe on their systems have the latest version of the update and do not need to take any further action. Customers with version 11.0.8212.0 of powerpnt.exe on their systems have the incorrect version of the update installed and will need to perform one of the actions listed in the following FAQ entry.

**The incorrect version of the update for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3 is installed on my system.** **What are the options for protecting my system?**

The initial packages that were released to the Microsoft Download Center earlier on August 12, 2008, labeled Version 1, contained incorrect versions of the binaries. While these versions did protect against the vulnerabilities discussed in the bulletin, they lacked other important security and reliability updates. This only affected the packages on the Microsoft Download Center; Microsoft Update and Office Update contained and were distributing the correct versions of the binaries and did not need to be updated. Customers who successfully deployed these updates through Microsoft Update or Office Update need not take any action. Those customers who deployed the update manually from the Microsoft Download Center prior to this update of the package (labeled Version 2) need to perform one of the following actions:

* Reinstall this latest version of the update, labeled Version 2, from the Microsoft Download Center manually. Please refer to the Affected Software table for the location of the latest packages for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3 on the Microsoft Download Center.
* Reinstall the update by using Microsoft Update or Office Update to automatically scan and offer the correct update.
* If you choose to not reinstall the update, you must manually set the registry key as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938810](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=938810) in order to block PowerPoint file types as a workaround.

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 13, 2008?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to communicate that the file information in the associated [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/949785) has been updated.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/949785).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).

Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

**The Office component discussed in this bulletin is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**What is included in the Microsoft Office update that causes the higher version of the update files?**

The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Office and additional changes to support corporate environment changes. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

**Why is this update rated Critical for PowerPoint 2000 but only rated Important for all other affected versions of PowerPoint?**

Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

## Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0120

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003 handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0120](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0120).

#### Workarounds for the Parsing Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1455

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or un-trusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  <https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us>

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:

| Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show | ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8 |
| ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template | ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8 |
| ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow | ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of Workaround:** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
