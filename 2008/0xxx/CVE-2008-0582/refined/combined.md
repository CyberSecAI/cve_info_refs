## SkypeFind fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input

#### Vulnerability Note VU#794236

Original Release Date: 2008-02-13 | Last Revised: 2008-02-13

---

### Overview

The Skype client does not properly filter user-supplied input that was received from the SkypeFind service. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Skype is a peer-to-peer application that provides Voice over IP (VoIP) and Instant Messaging services. The Skype client is available for the Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X and Linux operating systems. [SkypeFind](http://www.skype.com/help/guides/skypefind.html) allows users to review businesses. These reviews are viewable by others.  Skype does not properly filter input that was supplied to the SkypeFind full name field. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by injecting script into the full name field. When a user viewed the specially crafted SkypeFind profile, the script would be run in the Internet Explorer Local Machine Zone. |
| --- |

### Impact

| As explained in [VU#248184](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/248184), since the user-supplied script runs in the Local Machine Zone a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Skype has addressed this issue by filtering input supplied to the SkypeFind service. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access to the Skype URI**Blocking the skype: URI handler by using proxy servers or application firewalls may prevent some remote vulnerabilities in Skype from being exploited without user interaction. |
