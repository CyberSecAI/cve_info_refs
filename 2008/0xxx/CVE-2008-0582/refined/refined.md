Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Skype client fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input from the SkypeFind service, specifically within the "full name" field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application does not filter or validate the input provided to the SkypeFind full name field.
*   **Script Injection:** This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious script (e.g., JavaScript) into the full name field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When a user views a SkypeFind profile containing the injected script, the script executes within the Internet Explorer Local Machine Zone. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is further explained in VU#248184.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SkypeFind Service:** The attack vector is through the SkypeFind service, where an attacker can inject malicious script into a user's full name field.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a SkypeFind profile that contains the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to modify SkypeFind data:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the full name field via the SkypeFind service.
