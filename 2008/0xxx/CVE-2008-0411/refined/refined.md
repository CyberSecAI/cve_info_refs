{
  "CVE-2008-0411": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `zseticcspace()` function in `zicc.c` over-trusts the length of a PostScript array provided by the attacker, which leads to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `zseticcspace()` function in `zicc.c`.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by parsing a malicious Ghostscript file. Also, a denial of service can occur.",
      "Attack vectors": "Parsing a specially crafted PostScript file, often through a web browser that uses Ghostscript to render .ps files.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user or automated system to open a specially crafted PostScript file."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the handling of float vectors within the seticcspace function.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `seticcspace` function allows a user to define the expected number of float values in a vector (`range_buff`), which is statically allocated with a maximum of 8 floats. However, the function populating the array of floats can be passed a maximum size of `ncomps*2`, which can overflow the buffer if `ncomps` is large.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution is possible by overflowing the float buffer with crafted data.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted PostScript file that uses the `.seticcspace` operator with a large number of float values.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PostScript file that includes a malicious `.seticcspace` operator and either trick a user into opening it, or trigger it through an automated system processing PostScript files."
