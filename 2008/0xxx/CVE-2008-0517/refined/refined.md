Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0517:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `com_estateagent` component for Mambo. Specifically, the `objid` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- Authentication Bypass: As demonstrated in the provided exploit, the attacker can potentially retrieve usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table.
- Full Control: With retrieved database credentials, attackers might gain full control of the vulnerable application and the system hosting it.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack is performed by manipulating the `objid` parameter in the URL used to request a specific page (`index.php`).
- Malicious SQL injection in a GET request: The attacker injects SQL code within the `objid` parameter to alter the original query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

The provided exploit example shows that the attacker can use `union select` to retrieve the username and password fields from the `mos_users` table by injecting SQL code in the objid parameter:
```
index.php?option=com_estateagent&Itemid=S@BUN&func=showObject&info=contact&objid=-9999/**/union/**/select/**/username,password/**/from/**/mos_users/*&results=S@BUN
```
This confirms that the `objid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
