  Impact: Systems that have been manually configured to use rlogin and host.equiv may unexpectedly permit root login

  Description: The manpage for the configuration file hosts.equiv indicates that entries do not apply to root. However, an implementation issue in rlogind causes these entries to also apply to root. This update addresses the issue by properly disallowing rlogin from the root user if the remote system is in hosts.equiv. The rlogin service is not enabled by default in Mac OS X, and must be manually configured in order to be enabled. Credit to Ralf Meyer for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1478-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
January 28, 2008                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0226 CVE-2008-0227

Luigi Auriemma discovered two buffer overflows in YaSSL, an SSL
implementation included in the MySQL database package, which could lead
to denial of service and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51-3.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch5.

The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mysql-dfsg-5.0.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-588-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

19 March 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

Masaaki Hirose discovered that MySQL could be made to dereference

a NULL pointer. An authenticated user could cause a denial of service

(application crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA

table. This issue only affects Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10. ([CVE-2006-7232](/security/CVE-2006-7232))

Alexander Nozdrin discovered that MySQL did not restore database access

privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines. An

authenticated user could exploit this to gain privileges. This issue

does not affect Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-2692](/security/CVE-2007-2692))

Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL did not properly update the DEFINER

value of an altered view. An authenticated user could use CREATE SQL

SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW statements to gain privileges.

([CVE-2007-6303](/security/CVE-2007-6303))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that yaSSL as included in MySQL did not

properly validate its input. A remote attacker could send crafted

requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 in the default installation.

([CVE-2008-0226](/security/CVE-2008-0226), [CVE-2008-0227](/security/CVE-2008-0227))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.45-1ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.45-1ubuntu3.3)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.38-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.38-0ubuntu1.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.24a-9ubuntu2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.24a-9ubuntu2.4)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mysql-server-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mysql-dfsg-5.0/5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.8)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
yaSSL is an open source SSL library mainly used in MySQL and in other
projects.
On MySQL, if SSL support is enabled, is possible to use this
vulnerability for pre-authentication code execution.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
-------------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in ProcessOldClientHello
-------------------------------------------
The buffer which contains the data received by the client in the Hello
packet has the following structure (from yassl\_imp.hpp):
class ClientHello : public HandShakeBase {
ProtocolVersion client\_version\_;
Random random\_;
uint8 id\_len\_; // session id length
opaque session\_id\_[ID\_LEN];
uint16 suite\_len\_; // cipher suite length
opaque cipher\_suites\_[MAX\_SUITE\_SZ];
uint8 comp\_len\_; // compression length
CompressionMethod compression\_methods\_;
...
where ID\_LEN is 32 elements long, MAX\_SUITE\_SZ 64 and RAN\_LEN (Random)
is 32.
The ProcessOldClientHello function called when an old version of the
Hello packet is received doesn't have the needed checks for limiting
the amount of data which will fill these 3 fields leading to a
buffer-overflow vulnerability exploitable for executing code remotely.
From handshake.cpp:
void ProcessOldClientHello(input\_buffer& input, SSL& ssl)
...
ClientHello ch;
...
for (uint16 i = 0; i < ch.suite\_len\_; i += 3) {
byte first = input[AUTO];
if (first) // sslv2 type
input.read(len, SUITE\_LEN); // skip
else {
input.read(&ch.cipher\_suites\_[j], SUITE\_LEN);
j += SUITE\_LEN;
}
}
ch.suite\_len\_ = j;
if (ch.id\_len\_)
input.read(ch.session\_id\_, ch.id\_len\_);
if (randomLen < RAN\_LEN)
memset(ch.random\_, 0, RAN\_LEN - randomLen);
input.read(&ch.random\_[RAN\_LEN - randomLen], randomLen);
...
------------------------------------------------
B] buffer-overflow in "input\_buffer& operator>>"
------------------------------------------------
Another buffer-overflow is located in the function used for handling
the normal Hello packet but in this case doesn't seem possible (or
easily possible) to exploit this vulnerability for executing code.
From yassl\_imp.cpp:
input\_buffer& operator>>(input\_buffer& input, ClientHello& hello)
...
hello.id\_len\_ = input[AUTO];
if (hello.id\_len\_) input.read(hello.session\_id\_, ID\_LEN);
// Suites
byte tmp[2];
tmp[0] = input[AUTO];
tmp[1] = input[AUTO];
ato16(tmp, hello.suite\_len\_);
input.read(hello.cipher\_suites\_, hello.suite\_len\_);
...
-----------------------------------------------------
C] invalid memory access in HASHwithTransform::Update
-----------------------------------------------------
The usage of a too big size value in the Hello packet leads to a crash
of the library through the reading of data outside the memory
containing the incoming packet.
From hash.cpp:
void HASHwithTransform::Update(const byte\* data, word32 len)
{
// do block size increments
word32 blockSz = getBlockSize();
byte\* local = reinterpret\_cast<byte\*>(buffer\_);
while (len) {
word32 add = min(len, blockSz - buffLen\_);
memcpy(&local[buffLen\_], data, add);
...

4) Fix

A mail has been sent to the developers yesterday during my tests only
to inform them of the vulnerabilities.
