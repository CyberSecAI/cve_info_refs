{
  "CVE-2008-0226": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in yaSSL, an SSL implementation included in the MySQL database package, could lead to denial of service and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ProcessOldClientHello` function in yaSSL lacks proper checks when handling an old version of the Hello packet, which can lead to buffer overflows due to uncontrolled data input into fields like `session_id_`, `cipher_suites_`, and `random_`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer overflow in `ProcessOldClientHello`",
      "Buffer overflow in `input_buffer& operator>>`",
      "Invalid memory access in `HASHwithTransform::Update`"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted requests to a MySQL server using the vulnerable yaSSL library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to the MySQL server."
