    "ID": "CVE-2008-0547",
    "content": "The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in CandyPress eCommerce suite 4.1.1.26, including SQL injection, XSS, and path disclosure. CVE-2008-0547 is listed as one of the associated CVEs.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** Improper input sanitization in `ajax_optInventory.asp`, `utilities_ConfigHelp.asp` and `ajax_getBrands.asp` allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of input sanitization in `utilities_ConfigHelp.asp` allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.\n*   **Path Disclosure:** The `SA_shipFedExMeter.asp` reveals the server path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple ASP files (`ajax_optInventory.asp`, `utilities_ConfigHelp.asp` and `ajax_getBrands.asp`). By injecting SQL commands into the `idProduct`, `options`, and `helpfield` parameters, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including credit card details, usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. The `UNION SELECT` SQL command is used for data extraction.\n*   **XSS:** The application allows for Cross-Site Scripting through the `helpfield` parameter in `utilities_ConfigHelp.asp`. By injecting JavaScript, an attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers. \n*   **Path Disclosure:** The `SA_shipFedExMeter.asp` discloses the full path of the server when accessed with `FedExAccount=admin`. This information can be used by attackers to gain a better understanding of the system's architecture.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Breach:** Successful SQL injection attacks can lead to a complete breach of sensitive data, including customer information (potentially including encrypted credit card data), admin credentials, and other configuration data.\n*  **Account Compromise:**  Attackers could potentially use the extracted credentials to gain administrative access to the online store. \n*   **Malicious Script Execution:** XSS vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be injected, potentially leading to account hijacking, session stealing, or redirecting users to malicious websites.\n*   **Information Gathering:** Path disclosure can provide valuable information to attackers, facilitating further exploitation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities by crafting malicious GET requests to the vulnerable ASP files. These requests include SQL injection payloads within parameters such as `idProduct`, `options`, and `helpfield`.\n*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The XSS vulnerability is also exploited through a malicious GET request to `/admin/utilities_ConfigHelp.asp`.\n*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Path Disclosure can be exploited through a GET request to `/admin/SA_shipFedExMeter.asp` with the `FedExAccount` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the CandyPress eCommerce suite. There is no mention of the need for local access. All attacks are remote.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** None of the attacks require prior authentication, meaning they can be exploited by any user who has access to the application URLs. \n"
