Based on the provided documents, here's information regarding CVE-2008-0891:

*   **Vulnerability:** Double-free vulnerability in OpenSSL's handling of TLS server name extension data.

*   **Root Cause:** The `tlsext_hostname` field within the `s->session` structure is not properly set to `NULL`, which leads to a double free condition.

*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet to a server application using OpenSSL.

*   **Impact:** This double-free can cause a denial of service (DoS) via application crash.

*   **Affected Versions:** OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.8h, specifically when compiled with non-default TLS server name extensions. Ubuntu 8.04 LTS is mentioned as not compiling TLS server extensions by default.

*   **Affected Systems:**  Slackware 11.0, 12.0, 12.1, and -current, Ubuntu 8.04, and Gentoo (<0.9.8g-r2).

*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8h or a patched version.  For Ubuntu 8.04, upgrade `libssl0.9.8` to version `0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.3`.  Slackware also requires upgrading OpenSSH alongside OpenSSL.
