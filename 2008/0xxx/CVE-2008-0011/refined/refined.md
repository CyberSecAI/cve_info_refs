It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, and affected software. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the way Windows performs error checking on MJPEG video streams embedded in ASF or AVI media files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows MJPEG Codec handles MJPEG streams in AVI or ASF files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n  -   **E-mail:** An attacker could send a media file with a specially crafted MJPEG file embedded in it to the user, convincing them to open it.\n  -   **Web-based:** An attacker could host a website containing specially crafted content to exploit the vulnerability, or compromise existing websites.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted MJPEG file, either through email, a malicious website, or a compromised website hosting the crafted file. The user's system must be running a vulnerable version of DirectX."
