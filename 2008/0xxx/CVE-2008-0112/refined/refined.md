{
  "CVE-2008-0112": {
    "Root cause": "Microsoft Excel does not perform sufficient validation of file data when importing a file into Excel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of file data during import."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed .slk file to the user which can be imported into Excel.",
      "Hosting the malformed file on a website and convincing the user to import it.",
      "Including the file as an email attachment."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed .slk file, and either convince a user to open it or import it using an affected version of Excel. Social engineering is required to convince the user to open the malicious file."
  }
