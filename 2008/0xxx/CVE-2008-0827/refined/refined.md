```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 'cid' parameter in the PHP-Nuke 'books' module is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the 'cid' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords, or potentially modify data, gain administrative access to the system, or execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted 'cid' parameter, the attacker can inject SQL code into the query that the application runs against the database.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
