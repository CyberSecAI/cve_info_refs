The provided content details a blind SQL injection vulnerability in Binn SBuilder, specifically affecting the `full_text.php` page via the `nid` parameter.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `nid` parameter of `full_text.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection. The attacker cannot see the output of the query, but instead must rely on observing the application's behavior (e.g., page load time, presence/absence of errors) to deduce information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, table structures, and other potentially sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL using the vulnerable `full_text.php` page and injecting SQL code into the `nid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific pre-requisites beyond that are mentioned in the exploit details. The attacker can be remote.

The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including specific table and column names, example exploit URLs for checking table and column existence, and examples of how to determine if SQL injection is successful based on response behavior. It also lists specific tables and columns of interest like `binn_users`, `bu_id`, `bu_login`, `bu_pass`, `bu_name`, `bu_admin`, `bu_last_ip`, and `bu_last_date`.
