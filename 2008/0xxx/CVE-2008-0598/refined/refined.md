Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0598:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from bugzilla.redhat.com, rhn.redhat.com, lists.opensuse.org and www.ubuntu.com  explicitly mentions "CVE-2008-0598" and describes a vulnerability related to the Linux kernel's IA32 emulation leaking uninitialized data. Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2008-0598.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a flaw in the Linux kernel's IA32 emulation on x86_64 (64-bit) systems. During emulation, when copying data to user space, the kernel didn't clear all the memory, potentially leaking uninitialized data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Information Leak:** The core vulnerability is an information leak. The kernel, when emulating 32-bit applications on a 64-bit architecture, fails to properly clear memory before copying it to user space.
   - **Uninitialized Data Exposure:** This leads to the exposure of uninitialized kernel memory to user-space processes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** Local, unprivileged users could potentially access sensitive kernel data that should not be accessible to them. This could reveal information about the system, other processes, or potentially even cryptographic keys.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local, unprivileged users.
   - **Crafted Binary:** An attacker needs to prepare a specially crafted 32 bit binary which will trigger the kernel flaw on a x86_64 system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. No other specific privileges are required. The attacker needs to be able to run a crafted binary.
   - **Knowledge of Kernel Internals** Although not strictly required, understanding the memory layout and kernel data structures is beneficial to determine what information is being leaked and how it can be exploited further.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
  - Bug reports from Red Hat and Ubuntu describe that the kernel failed to properly clear memory when copying to user space on 64-bit systems when performing 32 bit emulation.. The bug reports highlight that older GCC versions would emit cld (clear direction flag) before string operations, but GCC 4.3+ assumes it is cleared when entering a function per the ABI, which the kernel did not adhere to during signal handling. A test case was also attached to verify that the flag was not cleared.
  - The SUSE security announcement indicates that the vulnerability occurred during some string operations.
  - Red Hat's RHSA-2008:0508 and RHSA-2008:0519 security advisories indicate that an unprivileged user could prepare and run a specially crafted binary to trigger this flaw and leak potentially sensitive data.

The vulnerability affects 32-bit emulation on 64-bit kernels on various platforms. The vulnerability is described as an important security issue, but is local and not remotely exploitable.
