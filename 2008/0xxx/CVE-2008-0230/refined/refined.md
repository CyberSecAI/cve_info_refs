{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled variable `$php121dir` to include a file, without proper sanitization, leading to Local File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or executing malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `php121dir` parameter in the `php121db.php` script URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `php121dir` parameter."
