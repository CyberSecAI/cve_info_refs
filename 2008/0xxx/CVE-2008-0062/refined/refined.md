Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-0062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the Kerberos 4 support of the MIT Kerberos 5 Key Distribution Center (KDC). Specifically, a global variable is not being properly set for some incoming Kerberos 4 message types. This leads to a null pointer dereference or a double free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null or Dangling Pointer:** Due to the missing global variable initialization for certain message types, the KDC may attempt to use a null or dangling pointer when processing such messages.
*   **Double Free:** The improperly set pointer can potentially be freed twice, corrupting memory.
*   **Uninitialized Stack Values:** Related to CVE-2008-0063, but mentioned here,  is the fact that the incoming krb4 message is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, but the remainder of the buffer is left untouched.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a KDC crash due to the null pointer dereference or double free, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running krb5kdc.
*   **Information Leakage:** The dangling pointer use may expose portions of process memory to the attacker, potentially including sensitive key data.
*   **Compromise of Kerberos key database:** Successful arbitrary code execution can lead to the compromise of the Kerberos key database and overall host security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers over the network.
*   **Malformed Messages:** Exploitation occurs through sending specially crafted Kerberos 4 messages to the KDC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable KDC.
*   **Ability to craft malicious Kerberos 4 Messages**: Ability to craft specifically crafted krb4 messages.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is only exposed if Kerberos 4 support is enabled on the KDC. This support is often compiled in by default, but not enabled in recent releases.
*   The provided content comes from multiple sources, all describing the same core vulnerability with slight variations in explanation and context.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves patching the krb5 code to handle krb4 messages correctly, including the proper setting of the global variable.
*   Some sources also mention a related CVE-2008-0063 which involves exposure of stack information, and CVE-2008-0947 a memory corruption issue in the kadmind process.
