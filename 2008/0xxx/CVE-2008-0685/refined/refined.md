Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The `ViewCat.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `CatID` parameter.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `ViewCat.php` script is also vulnerable to XSS via the `CatID` parameter.

**Root Cause:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `CatID` parameter in the `ViewCat.php` script. This allows for both injecting SQL commands and embedding malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or steal sensitive data, or even compromise the entire server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browser of users visiting the site. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are exploited via HTTP GET requests to `ViewCat.php` by manipulating the `CatID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server. No special privileges are required.
