Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the PHPEcho CMS version 2.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL when displaying a forum section is vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data.
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request that includes malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter of the URL when viewing a forum section. The vulnerable URL pattern is `http://server.com/Path/index.php?module=forum&show=section&id=[SQL Injection]`.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required as the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

*   **More Detail:** The provided exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker could retrieve usernames and passwords by using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract data from the `phpecms_users` table.
