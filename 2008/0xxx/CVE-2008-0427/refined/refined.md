Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2008-0427:

**CVE-2008-0427:** This CVE is associated with multiple vulnerabilities in Bloofox CMS version 0.3 and prior.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `login()` function in `system/class_permissions.php` does not sanitize user-supplied input (`username` and `password`) before using it in an SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization in the login function
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, through the login form.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to submit crafted HTTP POST requests to the login page. Magic quotes need to be disabled on the server.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism by injecting SQL code into the username field, allowing them to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   Vulnerable Code: `system/class_permissions.php`, lines 63-68:

            ```php
            function login($db,$user,$pass)
            {
              global $tbl_prefix;
              $pass = md5($pass);
              $db->query("SELECT uid,username,password,groups FROM ".$tbl_prefix."sys_user WHERE username = '".$user."' && password = '".$pass."' && blocked = '0' && deleted = '0' && status = '1' ORDER BY username");
              $total = $db->num_rows();
              ...
            }
            ```

        *   Example Exploit (POC):
            *   `Username`: `admin' or 1=1 /*`
            *   `Password`: `something`

2.  **Source Code Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `file.php` script does not properly sanitize the `file` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation of the `file` parameter, allowing directory traversal and arbitrary file access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, through an HTTP GET request
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted GET request to the `file.php` script along with a valid referer header.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive source code and configuration files.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   Vulnerable Code: `file.php`, lines 25-49
        *   The script attempts to prevent external linking using HTTP referer checks but does not prevent directory traversal using "../" sequences.

        *   Example Exploit (POC):
            *   `GET`: `<http://servername/bloofoxCMS_0.3/file.php?file=../../system/class_mysql.php>`
            *   `Referer`: `<http://servername/>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content lists both CVE-2008-0428 and CVE-2008-0427. CVE-2008-0428 is likely a related vulnerability or a follow-up report. However, based on the exploit information from Exploit-DB, this report primarily covers CVE-2008-0427.

*   The vulnerability is in Bloofox CMS version 0.3 and possibly prior versions.

*   The fix for these vulnerabilities is reported as "No!" in the advisory.
