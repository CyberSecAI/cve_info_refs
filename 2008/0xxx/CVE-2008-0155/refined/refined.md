- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application, EvilBoard 0.1a, is vulnerable to both SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied input within the `index.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **SQL Injection**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input within the `c` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input within the `c` parameter before displaying it on the page, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
-   **Impact of exploitation**:
    -   **SQL Injection**: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other user information, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    -   **XSS**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This code can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim, redirect the victim to malicious websites, steal cookies, or capture sensitive information.
-   **Attack vectors**:
    -   **SQL Injection**: The attack vector is the `c` parameter within the `index.php` file through HTTP GET requests. The attacker injects SQL code into the parameter.
    -   **XSS**: The attack vector is the `c` parameter within the `index.php` file through HTTP GET requests. The attacker injects JavaScript code into the parameter.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges or special network positions are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
