{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application includes local files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information such as configuration files or source code. Depending on the server's configuration and the included files, an attacker might also gain the ability to execute code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files in the `examples/dispatcher/framework/` directory."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists in multiple files within the `examples/dispatcher/framework/` directory: `simple.php`, `yui-menu.php`, `advanced.tpl.php`, `yui-menu.tpl.php`, `simple.tpl.php`, and `advanced.php`. The `page` or `uri` parameters of these scripts are used to include arbitrary files from the server without proper validation. The attacker can use directory traversal (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory. The file extension is not required when specifying the file to include."
