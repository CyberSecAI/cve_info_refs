      "Unsanitized input is used in the `abs_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to include remote files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URL with a `abs_path` parameter pointing to a remote shell script, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to include and execute the remote file."
