        "content": "Root cause: The vulnerability occurs due to the browser's handling of Content-Disposition: attachment headers with an incorrect content type of plain/text, as opposed to the proper text/plain, when downloading a file.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: The primary vulnerability is that the browser misinterprets the MIME type and, instead of viewing .txt files in the browser, it prompts the user to download them. This is due to incorrect entries being added to the mimeTypes.rdf file, specifically for the content type 'plain/text'. This change effectively renders text files unviewable in the browser.\n\nImpact of exploitation: The impact is a denial of service; users are prevented from easily viewing .txt files directly within the browser, requiring them to save and open those files separately instead.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack vector involves a malicious or improperly configured web server sending a file with the 'content-disposition: attachment' header and the content type set to 'plain/text' when it should be 'text/plain'.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs to be able to control the content type and disposition headers of a file served by a web server."
