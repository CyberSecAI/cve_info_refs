Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `info.php` file of Gradman version 0.1.3 and earlier.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `info.php` script improperly sanitizes the `tabla` parameter, allowing an attacker to include local files by manipulating this parameter with directory traversal sequences.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially accessing sensitive data like configuration files, passwords, or source code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a web request to `info.php` with a modified `tabla` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`). The null byte (`%00`) might be used to truncate the file path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
