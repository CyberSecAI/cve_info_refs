  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-0736",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple .asp files due to insufficient input validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Path Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including encrypted credit card data, admin credentials, and other configuration settings. They can also execute arbitrary code via XSS and obtain server paths through path disclosure vulnerabilities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable .asp files such as /ajax/ajax_optInventory.asp, /admin/utilities_ConfigHelp.asp, and /ajax/ajax_getBrands.asp"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.",
        "additional_info": "The exploit details reveal multiple SQL injection points in various parameters of the application, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database including database version, local setup IPs, admin email and password, payment gateway credentials (PayPal, UPS, WorldPay, DHL, Fedex), and other critical configuration parameters. The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by injecting JavaScript code into the helpfield parameter of  /admin/utilities_ConfigHelp.asp and the path disclosure vulnerability can be triggered by accessing /admin/SA_shipFedExMeter.asp"
