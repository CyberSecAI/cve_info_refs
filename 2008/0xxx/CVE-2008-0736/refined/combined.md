####################
- Fast Solution :
####################
1- Rename "/Admin" and "/Ajax" directories.
2- Rename (or delete) dangerous files which are:
	/ajax/ajax_optInventory.asp
	/ajax/ajax_getBrands.asp
	/admin/utilities_ConfigHelp.asp
	/admin/SA_shipFedExMeter.asp

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### Testimonials

Let me first say one thing to you guys .. Using your software i have built my business from next to nothing into something so huge and successful. I have made a lil extra cash and moved into webhosting and a few other great projects happening soon. I don’t get a chance to use your forums as much as I use to but that’s probably more due to the fact the site is so stable and I haven’t had any major problems.

**Nin**

I’ve had this product for only a few weeks and it is the best out there. The ease of install is simple, the service is unprecidented, the ability to tweak and develop it is awesome. Well done CandyPress, I’m your number one fan and supporter.

**PJ**

Like any worthwhile relationship, a customer-vendor affiliation brings together ideas and common goals. Striking the delicate balance between likes and dislikes can sometimes be difficult. Two traits I hold in high regard personally and professionally are integrity and respect. Consequently, I am compelled to tell you that working with you is an absolute pleasure. Everything is upbeat and up-front. Business is tough, but not with people like you. Thanks for your support and wonderful product.

 **T.S.G.**

CandyPress made setting up payments in our dating app a breeze! We’ve tried other solutions in the past, and none have ever been as easy to implement. The support team is super friendly and helpful as well. Thanks CandyPress!
