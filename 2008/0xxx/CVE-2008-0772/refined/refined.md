Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0772:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `com_doc` component of Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `sid` parameter within the `index.php?option=com_doc&task=view` URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and extract sensitive information from the database, specifically usernames and passwords stored in the `jos_users` table.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL, injecting SQL code through the `sid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without prior authentication or access to the system. They only need to know the vulnerable URL and be able to send HTTP requests to it.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the username and password from the `jos_users` table by injecting SQL into the `sid` parameter:
    ```
    index.php?option=com_doc&task=view&sid=-1/**/union/**/select/**/concat(username,0x3a,password),1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),0x3a,5,6,7,8,password,username,11/**/from/**/jos_users/
    ```

This SQL injection is used to bypass the intended SQL query and retrieve sensitive data.
