##### 3. Problem Description

a. Updated ESX Service Console package libxml2

A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 processes
certain content. If an application that is linked against
libxml2 processes malformed XML content, the XML content might
cause the application to stop responding.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3281 to this issue.
Additionally the following was also fixed, but was missing in the
security advisory.
A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2
handled long XML entity names. If an application linked against
libxml2 processed untrusted malformed XML content, it could cause
the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-3529 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Updated ESX Service Console package ucd-snmp

A flaw was found in the way ucd-snmp checks an SNMPv3 packet's
Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. An attacker could use
this flaw to spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 packet.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0960 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

c. Updated third party library libtiff

Multiple uses of uninitialized values were discovered in libtiff's
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm decoder. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted LZW-encoded TIFF file that would
cause an application linked with libtiff to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2327 to this issue.

# Net-SNMP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200808-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Net-SNMP allow for authentication bypass in
snmpd and execution of arbitrary code in Perl applications using Net-SMNP.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/net-snmp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.4.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.4.1.1** |

### Background

Net-SNMP is a collection of tools for generating and retrieving SNMP
data. The SNMPv3 protocol uses a keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code
(HMAC) to verify data integrity and authenticity of SNMP messages.

### Description

Wes Hardaker reported that the SNMPv3 HMAC verification relies on the
client to specify the HMAC length (CVE-2008-0960). John Kortink
reported a buffer overflow in the Perl bindings of Net-SNMP when
processing the OCTETSTRING in an attribute value pair (AVP) received by
an SNMP agent (CVE-2008-2292).

### Impact

An attacker could send SNMPv3 packets to an instance of snmpd providing
a valid user name and an HMAC length value of 1, and easily conduct
brute-force attacks to bypass SNMP authentication. An attacker could
further entice a user to connect to a malicious SNMP agent with an SNMP
client using the Perl bindings, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Net-SNMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/net-snmp-5.4.1.1"
```

## SNMPv3 improper HMAC validation allows authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878044

Original Release Date: 2008-06-10 | Last Revised: 2009-07-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way implementations of SNMPv3 handle specially crafted packets may allow authentication bypass.

### Description

| SNMP can be configured to utilize version 3, which is the current standard version of SNMP. SNMPv3 incorporates security features such as authentication and privacy control among other features. Authentication for SNMPv3 is done using keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), a message authentication code calculated using a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. Implementations of SNMPv3 may allow a shortened HMAC code in the authenticator field to authenticate to an agent or a trap daemon using a minimum HMAC of 1 byte.  This issue is known to affect Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP. Other SNMP implementations may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object that can be accessed by the impersonated user. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.4.1.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.2.4.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.0.11.1 and UCD-SNMP 4.2.7.1. Please see the [Net-SNMP download page](http://www.net-snmp.org/download.html).Alternatively, consult your vendor. See the [Systems Affected](#systems) section below for more information.**Apply a patch**Net-SNMP has released a patch to address this issue. For more information refer to [SECURITY RELEASE: Multple Net-SNMP Versions Released](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=833770). Users are encouraged to apply the patch as soon as possible. Note that patch should apply cleanly to UCD-snmp too. |
| --- |

| **Enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem**The configuration should be modified to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key. This option does not encrypt the HMAC, but does minimize the possible affects from this vulnerability. |

### [SNMP Research](#CTAR-7FBS8Q) Affected

Updated:  June 06, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Vulnerabilities have been found in the authentication code in multiple implementations of SNMPv3 including NetSNMP, SNMP Research, and many products derived from these reference

implementations.

The vulnerabilities in the implementations are slightly different but both allow a sender to create certain malformed packets which will be accepted as authentic by the receiver even though they are not authentic and thereby allow an interloper to masquerade as another principal.

The vulnerability applies equally to use of either MD5 or SHA-1.

This vulnerability is present in multiple products including those of SNMP Research.

This vulnerability is present in all SNMP Research products which support SNMPv3 up through and including Release 16.1, i.e., the vulnerability was present in SNMP Research product
Releases 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 16.1, as well as products derived from those code bases unless upgraded, (please see the next paragraph).

SNMP Research product Release 16.2 and subsequent releases are believed to not be subject to this vulnerability. SNMP Research product Release 16.2 became generally available in late 2006 and all SNMP Research customers with support agreements should have received product distributions that are not subject to this vulnerability in December 2006 or January 2007. SNMP Research products shipped after that time are not believed to be subject to this vulnerability.

In SNMPv3, the authentication subsystem is responsible for protecting against multiple threats:

 Modification of Information,
 Masquerade, and
 Message Stream Modification

This vulnerability potentially compromises the protections against each of the above threats.

The vulnerability is in the implementations. There are no known problems with the protocol design or specifications in this regard.

Remediation

It is suggested that users upgrade to current versions of the software which do not have these implementation problems and the resulting vulnerabilities.

Short-Term Mitigation

A short-term workaround for users who are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion is to modify their configuration data to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem (if it is not already in use), i.e., to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key.

By so doing, it is believed that it will not be computationally feasible for interlopers to "forge" valid packets without knowledge of the secret encryption key, i.e., such packets will be dropped at the receiver, thereby somewhat mitigating the problem by thwarting exploitation of the vulnerability.

However, while this workaround provides for data origin authentication of the payload of the message, and thereby defends against the masquerade threat (provided that secret encryption key remains known only to legitimate senders and receivers), it does not protect against the two other threats identified above. In particular, the message headers are not protected against the modification of information threat. The message timeliness indicators, which are in the message headers, are potentially subject to manipulation by an interloper, thereby enabling replay attacks (message stream modification threat). An interloper can sucessfully replay valid packets that have been captured since the encryption key(s) in use were most recently changed.

Therefore, enabling encryption should be viewed as a short-term mitigation strategy that is better than doing nothing but not as good as the recommended remdiation strategy.

**oCERT-2008-006 multiple SNMP implementations HMAC authentication spoofing**

**Description**:

Some SNMP implementations include incomplete HMAC authentication code that
allows spoofing of authenticated SNMPv3 packets.

The authentication code reads the length to be checked from sender input, this
allows the sender to supply single byte HMAC code and have a 1 in 256 chance of
matching the correct HMAC and authenticating, as only the first byte will be
checked. The sender would need to know a valid username.

Currently [Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org) and [UCD-SNMP](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp)
are known to be vulnerable, other SNMP implementations may also be affected.
The [eCos project](http://ecos.sourceware.org) includes code derived
from UCD-SNMP and is therefore also affected.

**Affected version**:

[Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org) <= 5.4.1, <= 5.3.2, <= 5.2.4

[UCD-SNMP](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp), all versions

[eCos](http://ecos.sourceware.org), all versions

**Fixed version**:

[Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org) >= 5.4.1.1, >= 5.3.2.1, >= 5.2.4.1

[UCD-SNMP](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp), N/A

[eCos](http://ecos.sourceware.org), patched in CVS

**Credit**: this issue was reported by [CERT/CC](http://cert.org), it is tracked as
[VU#878044](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/878044).

**CVE**: [CVE-2008-0960](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0960)

## SNMPv3 improper HMAC validation allows authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878044

Original Release Date: 2008-06-10 | Last Revised: 2009-07-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way implementations of SNMPv3 handle specially crafted packets may allow authentication bypass.

### Description

| SNMP can be configured to utilize version 3, which is the current standard version of SNMP. SNMPv3 incorporates security features such as authentication and privacy control among other features. Authentication for SNMPv3 is done using keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), a message authentication code calculated using a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. Implementations of SNMPv3 may allow a shortened HMAC code in the authenticator field to authenticate to an agent or a trap daemon using a minimum HMAC of 1 byte.  This issue is known to affect Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP. Other SNMP implementations may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object that can be accessed by the impersonated user. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.4.1.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.2.4.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.0.11.1 and UCD-SNMP 4.2.7.1. Please see the [Net-SNMP download page](http://www.net-snmp.org/download.html).Alternatively, consult your vendor. See the [Systems Affected](#systems) section below for more information.**Apply a patch**Net-SNMP has released a patch to address this issue. For more information refer to [SECURITY RELEASE: Multple Net-SNMP Versions Released](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=833770). Users are encouraged to apply the patch as soon as possible. Note that patch should apply cleanly to UCD-snmp too. |
| --- |

| **Enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem**The configuration should be modified to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key. This option does not encrypt the HMAC, but does minimize the possible affects from this vulnerability. |

### [SNMP Research](#CTAR-7FBS8Q) Affected

Updated:  June 06, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Vulnerabilities have been found in the authentication code in multiple implementations of SNMPv3 including NetSNMP, SNMP Research, and many products derived from these reference

implementations.

The vulnerabilities in the implementations are slightly different but both allow a sender to create certain malformed packets which will be accepted as authentic by the receiver even though they are not authentic and thereby allow an interloper to masquerade as another principal.

The vulnerability applies equally to use of either MD5 or SHA-1.

This vulnerability is present in multiple products including those of SNMP Research.

This vulnerability is present in all SNMP Research products which support SNMPv3 up through and including Release 16.1, i.e., the vulnerability was present in SNMP Research product
Releases 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 16.1, as well as products derived from those code bases unless upgraded, (please see the next paragraph).

SNMP Research product Release 16.2 and subsequent releases are believed to not be subject to this vulnerability. SNMP Research product Release 16.2 became generally available in late 2006 and all SNMP Research customers with support agreements should have received product distributions that are not subject to this vulnerability in December 2006 or January 2007. SNMP Research products shipped after that time are not believed to be subject to this vulnerability.

In SNMPv3, the authentication subsystem is responsible for protecting against multiple threats:

 Modification of Information,
 Masquerade, and
 Message Stream Modification

This vulnerability potentially compromises the protections against each of the above threats.

The vulnerability is in the implementations. There are no known problems with the protocol design or specifications in this regard.

Remediation

It is suggested that users upgrade to current versions of the software which do not have these implementation problems and the resulting vulnerabilities.

Short-Term Mitigation

A short-term workaround for users who are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion is to modify their configuration data to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem (if it is not already in use), i.e., to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key.

By so doing, it is believed that it will not be computationally feasible for interlopers to "forge" valid packets without knowledge of the secret encryption key, i.e., such packets will be dropped at the receiver, thereby somewhat mitigating the problem by thwarting exploitation of the vulnerability.

However, while this workaround provides for data origin authentication of the payload of the message, and thereby defends against the masquerade threat (provided that secret encryption key remains known only to legitimate senders and receivers), it does not protect against the two other threats identified above. In particular, the message headers are not protected against the modification of information threat. The message timeliness indicators, which are in the message headers, are potentially subject to manipulation by an interloper, thereby enabling replay attacks (message stream modification threat). An interloper can sucessfully replay valid packets that have been captured since the encryption key(s) in use were most recently changed.

Therefore, enabling encryption should be viewed as a short-term mitigation strategy that is better than doing nothing but not as good as the recommended remdiation strategy.

## SNMPv3 improper HMAC validation allows authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878044

Original Release Date: 2008-06-10 | Last Revised: 2009-07-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way implementations of SNMPv3 handle specially crafted packets may allow authentication bypass.

### Description

| SNMP can be configured to utilize version 3, which is the current standard version of SNMP. SNMPv3 incorporates security features such as authentication and privacy control among other features. Authentication for SNMPv3 is done using keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), a message authentication code calculated using a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. Implementations of SNMPv3 may allow a shortened HMAC code in the authenticator field to authenticate to an agent or a trap daemon using a minimum HMAC of 1 byte.  This issue is known to affect Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP. Other SNMP implementations may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object that can be accessed by the impersonated user. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.4.1.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.2.4.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.0.11.1 and UCD-SNMP 4.2.7.1. Please see the [Net-SNMP download page](http://www.net-snmp.org/download.html).Alternatively, consult your vendor. See the [Systems Affected](#systems) section below for more information.**Apply a patch**Net-SNMP has released a patch to address this issue. For more information refer to [SECURITY RELEASE: Multple Net-SNMP Versions Released](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=833770). Users are encouraged to apply the patch as soon as possible. Note that patch should apply cleanly to UCD-snmp too. |
| --- |

| **Enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem**The configuration should be modified to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key. This option does not encrypt the HMAC, but does minimize the possible affects from this vulnerability. |

### [SNMP Research](#CTAR-7FBS8Q) Affected

Updated:  June 06, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Vulnerabilities have been found in the authentication code in multiple implementations of SNMPv3 including NetSNMP, SNMP Research, and many products derived from these reference

implementations.

The vulnerabilities in the implementations are slightly different but both allow a sender to create certain malformed packets which will be accepted as authentic by the receiver even though they are not authentic and thereby allow an interloper to masquerade as another principal.

The vulnerability applies equally to use of either MD5 or SHA-1.

This vulnerability is present in multiple products including those of SNMP Research.

This vulnerability is present in all SNMP Research products which support SNMPv3 up through and including Release 16.1, i.e., the vulnerability was present in SNMP Research product
Releases 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 16.1, as well as products derived from those code bases unless upgraded, (please see the next paragraph).

SNMP Research product Release 16.2 and subsequent releases are believed to not be subject to this vulnerability. SNMP Research product Release 16.2 became generally available in late 2006 and all SNMP Research customers with support agreements should have received product distributions that are not subject to this vulnerability in December 2006 or January 2007. SNMP Research products shipped after that time are not believed to be subject to this vulnerability.

In SNMPv3, the authentication subsystem is responsible for protecting against multiple threats:

 Modification of Information,
 Masquerade, and
 Message Stream Modification

This vulnerability potentially compromises the protections against each of the above threats.

The vulnerability is in the implementations. There are no known problems with the protocol design or specifications in this regard.

Remediation

It is suggested that users upgrade to current versions of the software which do not have these implementation problems and the resulting vulnerabilities.

Short-Term Mitigation

A short-term workaround for users who are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion is to modify their configuration data to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem (if it is not already in use), i.e., to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key.

By so doing, it is believed that it will not be computationally feasible for interlopers to "forge" valid packets without knowledge of the secret encryption key, i.e., such packets will be dropped at the receiver, thereby somewhat mitigating the problem by thwarting exploitation of the vulnerability.

However, while this workaround provides for data origin authentication of the payload of the message, and thereby defends against the masquerade threat (provided that secret encryption key remains known only to legitimate senders and receivers), it does not protect against the two other threats identified above. In particular, the message headers are not protected against the modification of information threat. The message timeliness indicators, which are in the message headers, are potentially subject to manipulation by an interloper, thereby enabling replay attacks (message stream modification threat). An interloper can sucessfully replay valid packets that have been captured since the encryption key(s) in use were most recently changed.

Therefore, enabling encryption should be viewed as a short-term mitigation strategy that is better than doing nothing but not as good as the recommended remdiation strategy.

# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The net-snmp daemon implements the "simple network management protocol".
The version 3 of SNMP as implemented in net-snmp uses the length of the
HMAC in a packet to verify against a local HMAC for authentication.
An attacker can therefore send a SNMPv3 packet with a one byte HMAC and
guess the correct first byte of the local HMAC with 256 packets (max).
Additionally a buffer overflow in perl-snmp was fixed that can cause a
denial-of-service/crash.
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the update package.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart net-snmp after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

the log history, or the diff view
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-22 18:17:37 UTC  ``` CERT has told us of an authentication bypass flaw in Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP.  According to net-snmp:  "The quick technical summary is that the SNMPv3 packet contains a truncated HMAC authentication code. The author that wrote the code very very long ago to check that HMAC code used the length of the packet's version of the HMAC code to do the check. Thus if you send a single byte HMAC code, it'll only check it against the first byte of HMAC output. Thus it's fairly easy to spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 packet."   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-22 18:17:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 306408](attachment.cgi?id=306408&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=306408&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch") Proposed upstream patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c2)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Net-SNMP vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [net-snmp](/security/cves?package=net-snmp) -

## Details

Wes Hardaker discovered that the SNMP service did not correctly validate

HMAC authentication requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker

could send specially crafted SNMPv3 traffic with a valid username

and gain access to the user's views without a valid authentication

passphrase. ([CVE-2008-0960](/security/CVE-2008-0960))

John Kortink discovered that the Net-SNMP Perl module did not correctly

check the size of returned values. If a user or automated system were

tricked into querying a malicious SNMP server, the application using

the Perl module could be made to crash, leading to a denial of service.

This did not affect Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-2292](/security/CVE-2008-2292))

It was discovered that the SNMP service did not correctly handle large

GETBULK requests. If an unauthenticated remote attacker sent a specially

crafted request, the SNMP service could be made to crash, leading to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4309](/security/CVE-2008-4309))

2008/06/09 #2008-006 multiple SNMP implementations HMAC authentication spoofing
Description:
Some SNMP implementations include incomplete HMAC authentication code that
allows spoofing of authenticated SNMPv3 packets.
The authentication code reads the length to be checked from sender input,
this allows the sender to supply single byte HMAC code and have a 1 in 256
chance of matching the correct HMAC and authenticating, as only the first
byte will be checked. The sender would need to know a valid username.
Currently Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP are known to be vulnerable, other SNMP
implementations may also be affected. The eCos project includes code derived
from UCD-SNMP and is therefore also affected.
Affected version:
Net-SNMP <= 5.4.1, <= 5.3.2, <= 5.2.4
UCD-SNMP, all versions
eCos, all versions
Fixed version:
Net-SNMP >= 5.4.1.1, >= 5.3.2.1, >= 5.2.4.1
UCD-SNMP, N/A
eCos, N/A
Credit: this issue was reported by CERT/CC, it is tracked as VU#878044.
CVE: CVE-2008-0960

net-snmp security update (RHSA-2008-0529)

Original Release Date: August 21, 2008

Last Revised: August 21, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-282

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Net-SNMP package is a collection of tools for creating and gathering
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) information.

Net-SNMP was found to contain a vulnerability in how it verified an SNMPv3
packet's Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC). This could potentially
allow a remote attacker to spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 message. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-0960](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0960) to this issue.

Net-SNMP's Perl bindings were found to contain a buffer overflow flaw. An
attacker could potentially make use of this issue to get an application using
the Perl bindings to an arbitrary SNMP agent. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2008-2292](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2292) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0529.html>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SNMPv3 improper HMAC validation allows authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#878044

Original Release Date: 2008-06-10 | Last Revised: 2009-07-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way implementations of SNMPv3 handle specially crafted packets may allow authentication bypass.

### Description

| SNMP can be configured to utilize version 3, which is the current standard version of SNMP. SNMPv3 incorporates security features such as authentication and privacy control among other features. Authentication for SNMPv3 is done using keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), a message authentication code calculated using a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. Implementations of SNMPv3 may allow a shortened HMAC code in the authenticator field to authenticate to an agent or a trap daemon using a minimum HMAC of 1 byte.  This issue is known to affect Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP. Other SNMP implementations may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability allows attackers to read and modify any SNMP object that can be accessed by the impersonated user. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can view and modify the configuration of these devices. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.4.1.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.2.4.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.0.11.1 and UCD-SNMP 4.2.7.1. Please see the [Net-SNMP download page](http://www.net-snmp.org/download.html).Alternatively, consult your vendor. See the [Systems Affected](#systems) section below for more information.**Apply a patch**Net-SNMP has released a patch to address this issue. For more information refer to [SECURITY RELEASE: Multple Net-SNMP Versions Released](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=833770). Users are encouraged to apply the patch as soon as possible. Note that patch should apply cleanly to UCD-snmp too. |
| --- |

| **Enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem**The configuration should be modified to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key. This option does not encrypt the HMAC, but does minimize the possible affects from this vulnerability. |

### [SNMP Research](#CTAR-7FBS8Q) Affected

Updated:  June 06, 2008

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Vulnerabilities have been found in the authentication code in multiple implementations of SNMPv3 including NetSNMP, SNMP Research, and many products derived from these reference

implementations.

The vulnerabilities in the implementations are slightly different but both allow a sender to create certain malformed packets which will be accepted as authentic by the receiver even though they are not authentic and thereby allow an interloper to masquerade as another principal.

The vulnerability applies equally to use of either MD5 or SHA-1.

This vulnerability is present in multiple products including those of SNMP Research.

This vulnerability is present in all SNMP Research products which support SNMPv3 up through and including Release 16.1, i.e., the vulnerability was present in SNMP Research product
Releases 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 16.1, as well as products derived from those code bases unless upgraded, (please see the next paragraph).

SNMP Research product Release 16.2 and subsequent releases are believed to not be subject to this vulnerability. SNMP Research product Release 16.2 became generally available in late 2006 and all SNMP Research customers with support agreements should have received product distributions that are not subject to this vulnerability in December 2006 or January 2007. SNMP Research products shipped after that time are not believed to be subject to this vulnerability.

In SNMPv3, the authentication subsystem is responsible for protecting against multiple threats:

 Modification of Information,
 Masquerade, and
 Message Stream Modification

This vulnerability potentially compromises the protections against each of the above threats.

The vulnerability is in the implementations. There are no known problems with the protocol design or specifications in this regard.

Remediation

It is suggested that users upgrade to current versions of the software which do not have these implementation problems and the resulting vulnerabilities.

Short-Term Mitigation

A short-term workaround for users who are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion is to modify their configuration data to enable the SNMPv3 privacy subsystem (if it is not already in use), i.e., to encrypt the SNMPv3 traffic using a secret, private key.

By so doing, it is believed that it will not be computationally feasible for interlopers to "forge" valid packets without knowledge of the secret encryption key, i.e., such packets will be dropped at the receiver, thereby somewhat mitigating the problem by thwarting exploitation of the vulnerability.

However, while this workaround provides for data origin authentication of the payload of the message, and thereby defends against the masquerade threat (provided that secret encryption key remains known only to legitimate senders and receivers), it does not protect against the two other threats identified above. In particular, the message headers are not protected against the modification of information threat. The message timeliness indicators, which are in the message headers, are potentially subject to manipulation by an interloper, thereby enabling replay attacks (message stream modification threat). An interloper can sucessfully replay valid packets that have been captured since the encryption key(s) in use were most recently changed.

Therefore, enabling encryption should be viewed as a short-term mitigation strategy that is better than doing nothing but not as good as the recommended remdiation strategy.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c0)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-22 18:17:37 UTC  ``` CERT has told us of an authentication bypass flaw in Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP.  According to net-snmp:  "The quick technical summary is that the SNMPv3 packet contains a truncated HMAC authentication code. The author that wrote the code very very long ago to check that HMAC code used the length of the packet's version of the HMAC code to do the check. Thus if you send a single byte HMAC code, it'll only check it against the first byte of HMAC output. Thus it's fairly easy to spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 packet."   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c1)  Josh Bressers    2008-05-22 18:17:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 306408](attachment.cgi?id=306408&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=306408&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch") Proposed upstream patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=447974#c2)  Mark J.

Debian Bugs    : 485945 482333 504150

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in NET SNMP, a suite of
Simple Network Management Protocol applications. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-0960

    Wes Hardaker reported that the SNMPv3 HMAC verification relies on
    the client to specify the HMAC length, which allows spoofing of
    authenticated SNMPv3 packets.

CVE-2008-2292

    John Kortink reported a buffer overflow in the __snprint_value
    function in snmp_get causing a denial of service and potentially
    allowing the execution of arbitrary code via a large OCTETSTRING
    in an attribute value pair (AVP).

CVE-2008-4309

    It was reported that an integer overflow in the
    netsnmp_create_subtree_cache function in agent/snmp_agent.c allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service attack via a crafted
    SNMP GETBULK request.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems has been fixed in
version 5.2.3-7etch4.

For the testing distribution (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid)
these problems have been fixed in version 5.4.1~dfsg-11.

We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp package.

Subject: [oCERT-2008-006] multiple SNMP implementations HMAC authentication
	spoofing

2008/06/09 #2008-006 multiple SNMP implementations HMAC authentication spoofing

Description:

Some SNMP implementations include incomplete HMAC authentication code that
allows spoofing of authenticated SNMPv3 packets.

The authentication code reads the length to be checked from sender input,
this allows the sender to supply single byte HMAC code and have a 1 in 256
chance of matching the correct HMAC and authenticating, as only the first
byte will be checked. The sender would need to know a valid username.

Currently Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP are known to be vulnerable, other SNMP
implementations may also be affected. The eCos project includes code derived
from UCD-SNMP and is therefore also affected.

Affected version:

Net-SNMP <= 5.4.1, <= 5.3.2, <= 5.2.4
UCD-SNMP, all versions
eCos, all versions

Fixed version:

Net-SNMP >= 5.4.1.1, >= 5.3.2.1, >= 5.2.4.1
UCD-SNMP, N/A
eCos, N/A

Credit: this issue was reported by CERT/CC, it is tracked as VU#878044.
