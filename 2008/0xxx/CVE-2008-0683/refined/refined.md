Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `st_newsletter` WordPress plugin. The `shiftthis-preview.php` script within the plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `newsletter` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `newsletter` parameter) before using it in a database query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the WordPress database, including user credentials (usernames and password hashes). The provided exploit specifically attempts to extract `user_login` and `user_pass` from the `wp_users` table.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via an HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable `shiftthis-preview.php` file.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The `newsletter` parameter in the URL is the vector for injecting malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can exploit it remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Knowledge of Target Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `shiftthis-preview.php` file and the vulnerable parameter. This information can be obtained through publicly available resources.

**Exploit Code:**

The provided exploit demonstrates how to inject SQL code using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `wp_users` table:

```
wp-content/plugins/st_newsletter/shiftthis-preview.php?newsletter=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/concat(0x7c,user_login,0x7c,user_pass,0x7c)/**/FROM/**/wp_users
```

This specific SQL injection will concatenate the user login and password hash from the `wp_users` table, using `|` as a separator.
