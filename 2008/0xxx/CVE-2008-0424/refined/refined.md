Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `blog.php` script. Specifically, the `month` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `month` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, including user credentials. The example provided shows the attacker accessing the `users` table to retrieve `id`, `uname` and `upass`.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher access levels within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `blog.php` script.
- The vulnerable parameter is `month`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `blog.php` script.
- No special privileges or internal network access is required. The attacker can exploit this remotely.
