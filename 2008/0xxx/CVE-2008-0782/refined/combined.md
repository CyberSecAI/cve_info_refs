# MoinMoin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-27**

Several vulnerabilities have been reported in MoinMoin Wiki Engine.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/moinmoin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.1** |

### Background

MoinMoin is an advanced, easy to use and extensible Wiki Engine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered:

* A vulnerability exists in the file wikimacro.py because the
  \_macro\_Getval function does not properly enforce ACLs
  (CVE-2008-1099).
* A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the userform action
  (CVE-2008-0782).
* A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the login action
  (CVE-2008-0780).
* Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities exist in the file
  action/AttachFile.py when using the message, pagename, and target
  filenames (CVE-2008-0781).
* Multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities exist in
  formatter/text\_gedit.py (aka the gui editor formatter) which can be
  exploited via a page name or destination page name, which trigger an
  injection in the file PageEditor.py (CVE-2008-1098).

### Impact

These vulnerabilities can be exploited to allow remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML, overwrite arbitrary files, or read
protected pages.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MoinMoin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/moinmoin-1.6.1"
```
### References

* [CVE-2008-0780](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0780)
* [CVE-2008-0781](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0781)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [VIM] MoinMoin 1.5.x MOIND\_ID cookie Bug Remote Exploit

```
I haven't seen much coverage of this yet. The title of milw0rm 4957
isn't very suggestive. And SecurityFocus in Bugtraq 27404 calls it an
authentication bypass vulnerability.

At first blush, the PoC doesn't look that serious -- it creates an
account in MoinMoin and stores the profile info in a specified file
("README"). But MoinMoin lets anyone create a user profile, right?
And it uses the filename of that profile as the value for the MOIN_ID
cookie when you login, doesn't it? So what's the problem? Actually, I
think there are two:

First, the value of the MOIN_ID can be anything as long as it points
to an existing file that's writable by the web server user id. README
likely works because it is included by default. Ditto "../edit-log".
Even something like  "../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/
index.php" could work.

Second, the value for the 'quicklinks' parameter is not sanitized.
The PoC uses "podriamos-insertar-codigo-php-aqui-verdad-que-si",
which loosely translates to "we could insert PHP code here".  And
indeed, something like "<?php system(id) ?>" suitably encoded goes
through just fine.

Combine the two issues and you've probably got a nice vector for
remote code execution, as long as the remote web server supports PHP
and you can figure out a path to a writable PHP file in the web
directory root. Sweet!

I've verified the issues in MoinMoin 1.5.8 (the latest in the 1.5
series). The patch only fixes the first. As for the second, the
MoinMoin developers don't see that as their problem since you could
just as easily put PHP code in a Wiki page.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in MoinMoin, a
Python clone of WikiWiki. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2423

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2007-2637

    Access control lists for calendars and includes were
    insufficiently enforced, which could lead to information
    disclosure.

CVE-2008-0780

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    the login code.

CVE-2008-0781

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2008-0782

    A directory traversal vulnerability in cookie handling could
    lead to local denial of service by overwriting files.

CVE-2008-1098

    Cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
    the GUI editor formatter and the code to delete pages.

CVE-2008-1099

    The macro code validates access control lists insufficiently,
    which could lead to information disclosure.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-1.2etch1. This update also includes a bugfix wrt the
encoding of password reminder mails, which doesn't have security
implications.

The old stable distribution (sarge) will not be updated due to
the many changes and support for Sarge ending end of this month
anyway. You're advised to upgrade to the stable distribution if
you run moinmoin.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.
