Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0842

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cat_id` parameter of the `com_clasifier` component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `cat_id` parameter within the Joomla component `com_clasifier` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the exploit), leading to unauthorized access.
  - **Data Manipulation:**  An attacker could also modify or delete data, depending on database user permissions.
  - **Complete Compromise:** In worst case scenarios, an attacker could gain full control of the server hosting the Joomla site if they can leverage the SQL injection to escalate privileges and execute operating system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to a vulnerable Joomla installation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla site.
  - **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the SQL injection vulnerability present in the `com_clasifier` component of Joomla and the vulnerable parameter.
  - **No Authentication Needed:** The exploit does not seem to require any previous authentication, as the attack is directed towards the public facing web server.

**Exploit details:**
  - The provided exploit demonstrates an SQL injection using a crafted `cat_id` parameter within the URL.  Specifically, a crafted URL such as `index.php?option=com_clasifier&Itemid=S@BUN&cat_id=-9999999/**/union/**/select/**/concat(username,0x3a,password)/**/from/**/jos_users/*` is used to extract usernames and passwords from the database.
