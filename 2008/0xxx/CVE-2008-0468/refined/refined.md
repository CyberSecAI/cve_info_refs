  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2008-0468",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user input passed via the 'id' parameter in the 'category.php' script before using it in a SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The attacker could also potentially gain access to sensitive information such as user credentials (if the database contains this data).",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious SQL injection payload and injecting it into the 'id' parameter of 'category.php' via a GET request, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
