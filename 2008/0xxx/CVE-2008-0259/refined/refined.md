Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0259:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `mg_thumbs.php` script of minimal Gallery 0.8. Specifically, the script directly uses the `thumbcat` and `thumb` GET parameters in a `readfile()` function without any validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Disclosure (LFD):** The primary weakness is the ability to disclose arbitrary files on the server.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use ".." sequences in the GET parameters to traverse up the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, and password files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `mg_thumbs.php` with malicious values in the `thumbcat` or `thumb` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
- **Knowledge of target path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `mg_thumbs.php` script within the minimal Gallery installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry clarifies that both `thumbcat` and `thumb` parameters are vulnerable and can be used to read arbitrary files.
- The exploit-db entry lists example exploits such as:
  - `[Target.il]/[Path_mGallery]/_mg/php/mg_thumbs.php?thumbcat=../../../../../../etc/passwd`
  - `[Target.il]/[Path_mGallery]/_mg/php/mg_thumbs.php?thumb=../../../../../../[file].php`
- The exploit-db entry also includes a dork to find vulnerable installations: `powered by minimal Gallery 0.8`
- The exploit-db entry also incorrectly references the related CVE-2008-0260 (This entry is likely a duplicate for a different vulnerability)

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation, leading to remote file disclosure via path traversal, which could expose sensitive data.
