How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- Acroread wrapper script minor /tmp race
Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 contained a /tmp race in its "acroread"
wrapper script in the SSL certificate handling. (CVE-2008-0883)
This problem is not triggered by just starting acrobat reader,
but only on certificate handling.
Furthermore Acrobat Reader contained several duplicated copies of
system libraries, which have been removed by this update to make sure
they are up-to-date security wise by using the system provided ones.
Also on x86-64 platforms, the Mozilla embedding detection did not
work and was fixed, so the Splashscreen and Help are again displayed.
Updates have been released on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10,
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
Updates for version 7 for Novell Linux Desktop 9 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 are still pending.
- Asterisk security issues
A security update was released for the PBX Asterisk, fixing following
security issues:
CVE-2007-6430: Attackers could bypass host based authentication by
using a valid user name.
CVE-2007-6170: Attackers could inject SQL commands under certain
circumstances if 'cdr\_pgsql' was used.
Asterisk was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- cacti various vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were fixed in cacti:
- CVE-2008-0783: multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- CVE-2008-0784: path disclosure
- CVE-2008-0785: multiple SQL injections
- CVE-2008-0786: HTTP response splitting on very old PHP instances
Cacti is included in SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and
was fixed there.
- compat-openssl097g security fixes
This update of compat-openssl097g fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow
in function SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers(). This vulnerability potentially
allows remote code execution; depending on memory layout of the
process. (CVE-2007-5135)
We released updates for openssl already, but an update for the compat
0.9.7g openssl libraries was missing and is provided with this patch.
Released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE
10.2, 10.3.
- icu regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could crash the ICU library
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771).
Updated icu packages have been released for all distributions.
- libcdio buffer overflow
A security bug was fixed in libcdio. Long file names in ISO file
systems with Joliet extension could cause a buffer overflow in
libcdio (CVE-2007-6613).
libcdio fixes were released for all SUSE Linux products.
- wireshark/ethereal security problems
The network analyzer wireshark (formerly known as ethereal) was
updated to fix the following security bugs:
- CVE-2008-1070: The SCTP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1071: The SNMP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1072: The TFTP dissector could crash Wireshark (maybe
a bug in the Cairo library on specific platforms)
- Jakarta Tomcat security problems
Various security issues in Jakarta Tomcat have been fixed:
- CVE-2006-7196: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
example JSP applications
- CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character
- CVE-2007-3385: Handling of \" in cookies
- CVE-2007-5461: tomcat path traversal / information leak
- CVE-2007-1860: directory traversal
- CVE-2008-0128: tomcat https information disclosure
- CVE-2005-2090: tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
Updates have been released for all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-02-14 05:19:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Lack of input saintization can reportedly [1] [2] compose XSS, SQL injection or HTTP response splitting attack vector.   [1] <http://www.cacti.net/release_notes_0_8_7b.php> [2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/28872/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c1)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-02-14 05:21:29 UTC  ``` CVE name/names was/were requested   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c3)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-14 15:31:42 UTC  ``` cacti-0.8.7b-1.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c4)  Jon Stanley    2008-02-15 04:31:29 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 432473](show_bug.cgi?id=432473 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - New upstream 0.8.7b has important security updates") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c5)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-16 02:11:57 UTC  ``` cacti-0.8.7b-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-16 02:14:21 UTC  ``` cacti-0.8.7b-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=432758#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-19 09:01:55 UTC  ``` CVE ids:  * XSS vulnerabilities  CVE-2008-0783: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Cacti 0.8.7 before 0.8.7b and 0.8.6 before 0.8.6k allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) view_type parameter to graph.php, (2) filter parameter to graph_view.php, and (3) action and login_username parameters to index.php/login.   * Path disclosure vulnerabilities  [CVE-2008-0784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0784) graph.php in Cacti 0.8.7 before 0.8.7b and 0.8.6 before 0.8.6k allows remote attackers to obtain the full path via an invalid local_graph_id parameter and other unspecified vectors.  Note: This is not an issue for Fedora packages, as installation path can be trivially figured out from RPMs.   * SQL injection vulnerabilities  CVE-2008-0785: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Cacti 0.8.7 before 0.8.7b and 0.8.6 before 0.8.6k allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) graph_list parameter to graph_view.php, (2) leaf_id and id parameters to tree.php, (3) local_graph_id parameter to graph_xport.php, and (4) login_username parameter to index.php/login.   * HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities  CVE-2008-0786: CRLF injection vulnerability in Cacti 0.8.7 before 0.8.7b and 0.8.6 before 0.8.6k, when running on older PHP interpreters, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via unspecified vectors.  Note: This may be a non-issue for Fedora too, as reportedly only works on unspecified older PHP versions.
