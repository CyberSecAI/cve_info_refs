  "CVE-2008-0419": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists in Mozilla products that may allow a remote attacker to view browser history or cause a denial of service when handling malicious image files when a user leaves a page with designMode frames. The reported issue can be used to steal a user's navigation history, forward navigation information, and crash the user's browser. The crash showed evidence of memory corruption and might be exploitable to run arbitrary code. JavaScript must be enabled in order for this vulnerability to exist. Exploitation can occur by accessing a specially crafted web page.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition exists in the image handling of designMode elements where the '_moz_resizing' attribute is removed after location.href has been updated. An attribute mutation event listener is triggered when the attribute is removed after the URL is changed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of attribute modification events",
      "Race condition in page navigation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to view browser history information, forward navigation information, cause a denial of service, and potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Accessing a specially crafted web page"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious web page with a designMode frame and a crafted image file, and trick the victim into accessing it."
