  "CVE-2008-0465": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Seagull 0.6.3 is vulnerable to a remote file disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the 'optimizer.php' script.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause",
        "detail": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation within the `optimizer.php` script. Specifically, the `files` parameter in the GET request is not sanitized before being used in file operations."
      },
      {
        "type": "Weaknesses",
        "detail": "The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the 'files' parameter. The application uses the `$_GET['files']` value to construct a file path using `dirname(__FILE__) . '/' . $fileName`, without verifying or sanitizing the provided filenames which can contain directory traversal sequences like '../../'."
      },
      {
        "type": "Impact",
        "detail": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server. By crafting a specific URL with directory traversal sequences within the `files` parameter, an attacker can access sensitive files on the server, including potentially configuration files, password hashes, or source code."
      },
       {
        "type": "Attack vector",
        "detail": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `optimizer.php` script. The attacker manipulates the `files` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside the intended directory."
      },
      {
        "type": "Attacker capabilities",
         "detail": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. There is no need for authentication."
