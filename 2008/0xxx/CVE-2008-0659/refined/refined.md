    "content": "MySpace Uploader - 'MySpaceUploader.ocx 1.0.0.4' Remote Buffer Overflow\n\nEDB-ID: 5025\nCVE: 2008-0659\nAuthor: Elazar\nType: remote\nPlatform: Windows\nDate: 2008-01-31\nVulnerable App:\nMySpace Uploader Buffer Overflow Exploit\nwritten by e.b.\nTested on Windows XP SP2(fully patched) English, IE6\nMySpaceUploader.ocx version 1.0.0.4: {48DD0448-9209-4F81-9F6D-D83562940134}\nAurigma ImageUploader4.ocx version version 4.5.70.0: {6E5E167B-1566-4316-B27F-0DDAB3484CF7}\nThanks to h.d.m. and the Metasploit crew\n\nThe provided HTML/JavaScript exploit targets a buffer overflow in the `Action` property of the `MySpaceUploader.ocx` ActiveX control. This control is identified by the CLSID `{48DD0448-9209-4F81-9F6D-D83562940134}`. The exploit crafts a large string to overflow a buffer when the `Action` property is set.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow in the Action property of the MySpaceUploader.ocx ActiveX control.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The ActiveX control fails to perform adequate bounds checking when handling user-supplied input for the Action property, leading to a buffer overflow.\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious HTML page.\nAttack vectors: Remote exploitation via a malicious HTML page loaded in Internet Explorer.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page and convince a victim to open it in Internet Explorer. The user must also have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed and enabled. \n\nThe exploit uses two different shellcodes:\n- shellcode1 is for executing calc.exe\n- shellcode2 is for a bind shell on port 4444\n\nThe exploit code uses JavaScript to create an ActiveX object and triggers the overflow by setting the Action property with a large string. It also uses memory spraying to increase the reliability of shellcode execution."

    "content": "Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control stack buffer overflows\nVulnerability Note VU#776931\n\nOverview:\nThe Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control contains multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\n\nDescription:\nAurigma ImageUploader is an ActiveX control that provides the ability to upload pictures using the Internet Explorer web browser. The Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control is used by multiple web sites, such as Facebook and MySpace. This ActiveX control contains multiple stack buffer overflows in several properties, including Action, ExtractExif, and ExtractIptc. Limited testing has shown that versions up to and including version 5.0.30 may be vulnerable. Exploit code is publicly available.\n\nImpact:\nBy convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user on a vulnerable system.\n\nSolution:\nApply an update\nThis issue is addressed in versions 5.1.0, 4.7.0, 5.0.41, and 4.6.31. Please see the Aurigma blog entry for more details. This issue is also addressed in Microsoft Security Advisory (953839). This update sets the kill bits for various Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control versions and is available through various update channels, such as Microsoft Update.\n\nDisable the Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer\nThe Aurigma ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs. Note that this list may not include all versions of the control.\n{104B0A37-AB99-4F06-8032-8BBDC3B77DDB}{17D667BA-5675-4AAB-9221-08B9379384D4}{48DD0448-9209-4F81-9F6D-D83562940134}{55027008-315F-4F45-BBC3-8BE119764741}{5C6698D9-7BE4-4122-8EC5-291D84DBD4A0}{6E5E167B-1566-4316-B27F-0DDAB3484CF7}{A18962F6-E6ED-40B1-97C9-1FB36F38BFA8}{AE2B937E-EA7D-4A8D-888C-B68D7F72A3C4}{AE6C4705-0F11-4ACB-BDD4-37F138BEF289}{B85537E9-2D9C-400A-BC92-B04F4D9FF17D}{BA162249-F2C5-4851-8ADC-FC58CB424243}{D1D98C0F-A339-42AB-BD5F-EA0FF5D0E65F}{D1EA8D3D-F511-4388-B754-4A0CC14A4778}{F1F51698-7B63-4394-8743-1F4CF1853DE1}{F89EF74A-956B-4BD3-A066-4F23DF891982}{FB90BA05-66E6-4c56-BCD3-D65B0F7EBA39}\nMore information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document 240797. Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:\n\nThe provided information confirms that CVE-2008-0659 is related to stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control, specifically in the Action, ExtractExif, and ExtractIptc properties. It also mentions that the vulnerability is triggered by viewing a specially crafted HTML document, leading to arbitrary code execution. The affected versions include up to 5.0.30. The advisory provides a list of CLSIDs for the vulnerable ActiveX controls, including the one mentioned in the exploit from Exploit-DB: {48DD0448-9209-4F81-9F6D-D83562940134}.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control, specifically within the Action, ExtractExif, and ExtractIptc properties.\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of proper input validation and bounds checking in the ActiveX control's properties.\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.\nAttack vectors: Remote exploitation by convincing a user to view a malicious HTML document.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML document and convince a user to open it, assuming the vulnerable ActiveX control is installed and enabled. The user must use a vulnerable version of the control with Internet Explorer."
