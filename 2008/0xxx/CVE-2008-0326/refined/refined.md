{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `show.php` script, which allows for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords. In this specific exploit example, the attacker attempts to read the content of the `admin/pconfig.php` file which is used to store credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL parameter (`id`) in the `show.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL."
