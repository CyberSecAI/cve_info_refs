Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0072:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the `emf_multipart_encrypted()` function within the `mail/em-format.c` file of the Evolution email client. This function is used to process encrypted email messages. The vulnerability arises when handling data such as the "Version:" field in an encrypted email.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The code improperly handles format strings when processing specific data within encrypted emails. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers that are then interpreted by the vulnerable function, leading to potentially exploitable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Evolution. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can also be exploited to cause the Evolution application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack via Email:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted, encrypted email messages.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must open or select the malicious email for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, without requiring any prior access to the victim's system.
- **Crafted Email:** The attacker must create a specially crafted, encrypted email designed to exploit the format string vulnerability.
- **Email Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver this crafted email to the victim.
