How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The function emf\_multipart\_encrypted() that is used to process encrypted
messages is vulnerable to format-string bugs.
This bug can be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by
sending a crafted encrypted eMail.
2) Solution or Work-Around
No work-around. Please install the current security update package.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart evolution.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : evolution
Vulnerability  : format string attack
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0072

Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered that Evolution, the e-mail and groupware suite,
had a format string vulnerability in the parsing of encrypted mail messages.
If the user opened a specially crafted email message, code execution was
possible.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.3-6etch2.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-2sarge3. Some architectures have not yet completed building
the updated package for sarge at this time, they will be added as they
come available.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.3-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your evolution package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Evolution: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200803-12**

A format string error has been discovered in Evolution, possibly resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/evolution** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.12.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.12.3-r1** |

### Background

Evolution is a GNOME groupware application.

### Description

Ulf Harnhammar from Secunia Research discovered a format string error
in the emf\_multipart\_encrypted() function in the file mail/em-format.c
when reading certain data (e.g. the "Version:" field) from an encrypted
e-mail.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
encrypted e-mail, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Evolution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Evolution users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/evolution-2.12.3-r1"
```

From Secunia Advisory [SA29057](http://secunia.com/advisories/29057/):*A format string error in the "emf\_multipart\_encrypted()" function in mail/em-format.c when displaying data (e.g. the "Version:" field) from an encrypted e-mail message can be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted e-mail message.Successful exploitation requires that the user selects a malicious e-mail message.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause Evolution to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  The Evolution team has released a patch to address this issue. See GNOME Bug [520745](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520745) for more information. Users and administrators who do not compile Evolution from source should obtain fixed software from their operating system vendor. |

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:03:45 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached Numeric-20.3.ebuild.  This is an update for use with python-2.1  It can be tested by starting a python shell (need a PPM image viewer installed: tkinter will suffice) and >>>from NumTut import * >>>view(greece)  should see a pretty picture.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10](attachment.cgi?id=10 "Numeric-20.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=10&action=edit "Numeric-20.3.ebuild")] Numeric-20.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11](attachment.cgi?id=11 "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=11&action=edit "Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff")] Numeric-19.0.0-Numeric-20.3.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This ebuild gives a Access violtion when run through the sandbox.  --------------------------- ACCESS VIOLATION SUMMARY ---------------------------LOG FILE = "/tmp/sandbox-Numeric-20.3-15709.log"  unlink:    /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc open_wr:   /usr/lib/python2.1/distutils/command/install_headers.pyc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 03:51:53 UTC  ``` The sandbox violation seems to be python version related.  I don't get a violation building against python-2.2. I even doubted that sandbox was working so I added a 'echo "fail" > /home/tod/tmp/fail.test' to the ebuild install function, and it then generated a access violation (sandbox is nice!).    Bottom line.  The simple fix seems to be change the depends to >=python-2.2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:34:59 UTC  ``` added dep on >=python 2.2   ``` |  |
