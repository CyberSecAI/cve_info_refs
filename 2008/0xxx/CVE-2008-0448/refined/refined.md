Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `class_HTTPRetriever.php` file of the PhpSearch script. The script uses a `require_once` statement with a variable `$libcurlemuinc` whose value is taken directly from user input via GET parameter. If the file is readable by the webserver, an attacker can supply a malicious URL via the `libcurlemuinc` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file specified by user-controlled input.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The script doesn't validate or sanitize the `$libcurlemuinc` variable before using it in the `require_once` function, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, website defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The vulnerable parameter `libcurlemuinc` is provided within the request's query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker should understand how to craft HTTP GET requests and how to specify parameters in the URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided example URL explicitly demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by including a malicious file (`[Sh3LL]`).
- The `is_readable` check is not a sufficient defense, as even if a file is readable by the webserver, it doesn't guarantee that it is safe to include.
