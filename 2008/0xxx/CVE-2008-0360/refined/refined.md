Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2008-0360:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Blogcms application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
        *   `index.php` is vulnerable via the `blogid` parameter.
        *   `action.php` is vulnerable via the `user` POST parameter.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple linked XSS vulnerabilities are present, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
        *   `photo/admin.php` and `photo/index.php` are vulnerable via URL parameters.
    *   **SiXSS (SQL Injection through XSS):** Multiple SiXSS vulnerabilities are present, where XSS is achieved through SQL error messages.
        *   `index.php` is vulnerable via the `blogid` parameter when combined with a specific `amount` parameter.
        *   `/admin/plugins/table/index.php` is vulnerable via the `field` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. The examples provided show the ability to retrieve usernames and passwords.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that could be executed in a victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other client-side attacks.
    *  **SiXSS:** Attackers could inject XSS payloads through SQL errors, resulting in similar client-side attacks as with XSS.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET and POST requests with malicious SQL code in specific parameters.
    *   **XSS:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **SiXSS:** Crafted URLs designed to trigger SQL errors containing the injected XSS payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Blogcms application. No prior authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
The advisory describes three main categories of vulnerabilities: SQL Injections, Linked XSS, and Linked SiXSS, all stemming from inadequate input handling by the Blogcms application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by the Digital Security Research Group (DSecRG).
*   The affected version is Blogcms 4.2.1b.
*   A patched version (4.2.1c) was released to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit examples provided demonstrate how to trigger the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
