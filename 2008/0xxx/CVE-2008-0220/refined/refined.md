{
  "CVE-2008-0220": {
    "Description": "The Gateway WebLaunch ActiveX control's DoWebLaunch() method is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the 2nd and 4th parameters, allowing arbitrary code execution. Both weblaunch.ocx and weblaunch2.ocx are affected, enabling the execution of arbitrary files.",
    "Root cause": "The `DoWebLaunch()` method in the Gateway WebLaunch ActiveX control does not properly validate the length of the input parameters, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Insecure Method"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the user, or cause a denial of service (browser crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message or attachment) that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML document and entice a user to open it using a vulnerable browser.",
     "Affected Controls": [
        "weblaunch.ocx",
        "weblaunch2.ocx"
      ],
      "More Info": "The vulnerability affects both `weblaunch.ocx` and `weblaunch2.ocx`. The ActiveX control is identified by CLSIDs: {93CEA8A4-6059-4E0B-ADDD-73848153DD5E} and {97BB6657-DC7F-4489-9067-51FAB9D8857E}. The provided exploit demonstrates remote code execution. One exploit uses shellcode to execute `calc.exe`, and the other uses shellcode for a bind shell on port 4444."
