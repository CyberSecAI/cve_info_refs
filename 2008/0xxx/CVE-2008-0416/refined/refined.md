  "CVE-2008-0416": {
    "description": "Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu discovered flaws in Firefox's character encoding handling. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The Mozilla HTML parser treated the backspace character as whitespace, and  a flaw was discovered in the way Mozilla parses the control character 0x80 under Shift_JIS encoding. Zero-length non-ASCII sequences in ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-KR, and HZ-GB-2312 were also identified as causing similar issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of character encoding",
      "Incorrect parsing of control characters"
    ],
    "impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary script execution on the user's browser, allowing attackers to steal credentials, deface websites or perform other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Tricking a user into opening a malicious webpage"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage, or inject the malicious code into a trusted site.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerabilities were fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.12. The vulnerability exists due to the HTML parser treating backspace characters as whitespaces, contrary to the HTML specification. Input filters on websites that adhere to the specifications can be bypassed."
