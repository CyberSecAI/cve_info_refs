Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0358

**Vulnerable Software:** PixelPost 1.7

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a **blind SQL injection** flaw in the `index.php` script when handling comment submissions. Specifically, the `parent_id` parameter is vulnerable. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `parent_id` parameter within a comment submission. The application does not return any direct output based on the query results, hence 'blind'. Attackers must infer the results through other means such as response times or error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including the administrator's username and the MD5 hash of the password. This is achieved by querying the `pixelpost_config` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Gaining access to the admin credentials could lead to full compromise of the application, potential server take over or further lateral movement if credentials are reused.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/index.php?showimage=1&popup=comment` with the vulnerable SQL payload in the `parent_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server where the PixelPost application is hosted.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques, specifically blind SQL injection to extract the data.
*   **No Authentication Required**: No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code uses the following steps:
1.  **Iterate Through Characters:** It iterates through ASCII characters (0-255) for both username and password.
2.  **Construct SQL Payload:** For each character, it builds a SQL injection payload that checks if the character at a specific position of the username or password matches the current ASCII character.
3.  **Send HTTP Request:** It sends an HTTP POST request with the constructed SQL payload in the `parent_id` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint.
4.  **Analyze Response:** It checks the HTTP response if it contains the string "Die" which indicates a successful match.
5.  **Build Credentials:**  If the character is matched, it appends it to the username or password string and continues to the next character.

The exploit uses a specific response characteristic (the string 'Die' appearing in the response) which is used to identify successful character matches in the blind SQL injection.
