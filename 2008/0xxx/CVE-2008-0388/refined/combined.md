by [Jeff Chandler](https://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/author/jeffro2pt0/ "Posts by Jeff Chandler")  on January 21st, 2008 in [WordPress Plugins](https://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/category/wordpress-plugins/), [WordPress Security](https://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/category/wordpress-security/)

If you are currently using the latest release of the [WP-Forum](http://www.fahlstad.se/wp-plugins/wp-forum/ "http://www.fahlstad.se/wp-plugins/wp-forum/") plugin, listen up. The websec security team has discovered a vulnerability within this plugin that can be exploited by malicious users to conduct SQL injection attacks. According to [Secunia](http://secunia.com/advisories/28567/ "http://secunia.com/advisories/28567/"):

> Input passed to the “user” parameter in the WordPress installation’s index.php script (when “forumaction” is set to “showprofile” and “page\_id” to a page with the “<!–WPFORUM–>” tag) is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

This vulnerability when exploited successfully allows the individual to retrieve usernames, password hashes, and email addresses for all users, including administrators. However, the user has to have knowledge of the proper database table prefix. This vulnerability has been confirmed in version 1.7.4 which is currently the most recent version available for download.

## Description:

WP-Forum is a WordPress plugin that enables you to have a forum directly attached to your WordPress installation. The plugin is based on [Simple Forum.](http://simpleforum.net/ "http://simpleforum.net/")

[EDIT] We wish the plugin author was notified of the vulnerability and given a chance to fix it, but there was no mention of it in the advisory. So until a fix is released, we suggest that the plugin is disabled and removed.

[EDIT] As pointed out in the comments, not the same as [Simple Forum WP Plugin](http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/simple-forum/).

   Would you be willing please, to point out that the ‘Simple Forum’ mentioned above is NOT the same as my own ‘Simple Forum WP Plugin’? (<http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/simple-forum/>) I found out quite recently that there was a stand alone system named ‘Simple Forum’ and have been debating whether to change the name of my plugin. But I would not want people to be confused! My own forum plugin is NOT based on this third party product and also has no relationship with WP-Forum.

   Thanks.

   **@Sabo** Thanks for doing that. Although if you were to look at the comments for that plugin on the blog, it looks like development for that plugin might be dead and has been dead for quite awhile.

   I could not reproduce that bug…I have some doubts that it really works

   but i simply fixed but using folowing code in “forum-functions.php”:

    `function forum_get_profile($user){

   global $user_ID, $table_threads, $wpdb, $rss_link, $profile_link;`

   if(is\_numeric($user)) {

   .....

   }

   just use that “is\_numeric” (since user ID are integers and not strings containing sql queries).

    @Dhruva Sagar Believe me, the exploit works like a charm, I already obtained some md5 hashed passwords from it. The exploit in combination with this <http://md5.rednoize.com/> is going to be a playground for all the script kiddies out there.

    @Cyneox did you use that code like this:

    function forum\_get\_profile if(is\_numeric($user){

    global $user\_ID, $table\_threads, $wpdb, $rss\_link, $profile\_link;

    or like this?

    function forum\_get\_profile($user){

    global $user\_ID, $table\_threads, $wpdb, $rss\_link, $profile\_link;

    if(is\_numeric($user)) {

    Because if you used the second one, I don´t know where should I close the }

    @Sabo

    the code was added in “forum-functions.php”.

    i used:

     `function forum_get_profile($user){

    global $user_ID, $table_threads, $wpdb, $rss_link, $profile_link;

    if(is_numeric($user)) {

    ...

    }`

    the last “}” comes after the “return”.

    I think this bug works only on pure wordpress (not wordpress mu) although i haven’t test it already…

    @Cyneox Dude, your fix didn´t work to fix the security issue, I implemented and then apply the exploit and I could obtain all the usersnames/md5hashedpasswords/e-mails@…

    That fix didn´t work for a normal WordPress installation.

    And thanks about the site, for the page navigation I´m using:

    @Sabo

    Well that fix did work for me. Actually I can’t really understand why it shouldn’t work.

    According to **<http://www.php.net/is_numeric>**:

     `is_numeric ( mixed $var )`

    if $var is a number (integer,doubles etc.) ‘the\_numeric’ will return **TRUE**. Else ‘FALSE’ will be returned.

    In OUR case the script should verify is the paramater given to ‘user’ is an integer or not.

    The normal page URL will be:

     `[http://blabla.com/?page_id=7&a.....ampuser=1](http://blabla.com/?page_id=7&forumaction=showprofile&user=1)`

    The hack makes use of not verificating the parameter given to ‘user’:

     `[http://www.blablabla.com/?page.....ull,concat](http://www.blablabla.com/?page_id=7&forumaction=showprofile&user=1+union+select+null,concat)(user_login,0x2f,user_pass,0x2f,user_email),null,null,null,null,null+from+wp_users/*`

    As you can see the value given to ‘user’ is **NOT** an integer and that’s why you add the condition (at the beginning of the script):

     `if (is_numeric($user)) {

    // here goes the rest of the php script

    }`

    I am using WPMU and the hack did not work on my site. Which version of WordPress/WPMU are you using ?

    Try wrapping the input with intval( ), too. Quick fix.

    @Cyneox

    I tried the patch on WP2.3.2 and didn´t worked.

    We can hardly read on this “track back spam” comments. Jeffro2pt0 man, at least if you are not going to use a easy to read theme separate at least your trackbacks from the normal posts.

    Just for the record, I always use something like $user = intval($user); to ensure input that should be a whole number is sanitised. Rather than check whether it is an integer, why not force it to be one (if it’s not numeric, 0 is returned)?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
