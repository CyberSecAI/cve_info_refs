Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0473 (identified in multiple sources)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `FolderName` parameter in `RTE_file_browser.asp` is not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `RTE_file_browser.asp` script does not check user sessions, making the directory traversal vulnerability exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.
*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** The `RTE_popup_save_file.asp` script allows attackers to create arbitrary HTML or HTM files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** Failure to sanitize the `FolderName` parameter in `RTE_file_browser.asp` opens the door for directory traversal attacks.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Absence of session checks in `RTE_file_browser.asp` allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The ability to create arbitrary files via `RTE_popup_save_file.asp` is a significant security issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can list directories, and files (txt, zip) on the server using directory traversal.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & Fake Pages:** The ability to create arbitrary HTML/HTM files on the server using `RTE_popup_save_file.asp` can be used to inject XSS payloads, or create fake web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:**  Attackers manipulate the `FolderName` parameter in the URL of `RTE_file_browser.asp` to perform directory traversal.
    *   Example: `http://[WebWiz RTE]/RTE_file_browser.asp?look=save&sub=\.....\\\.....\\\.....\\\.....\\\.....\\`
*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** Attackers can directly access `RTE_popup_save_file.asp` to create malicious HTML/HTM files.
    * Example: `http://[WebWiz RTE]/RTE_popup_save_file.asp`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**
* The provided content includes a "Fast Solution" by modifying the `RTE_file_browser.asp` to properly sanitize the `strSubFolderName` parameter, which is:
```
strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "/", "\", 1, -1, 1)
strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "\\", "\", 1, -1, 1)
strSubFolderName = Replace(strSubFolderName, "..", "", 1, -1, 1)
```
*   Renaming `RTE_popup_save_file.asp` is suggested as a temporary fix
*   The vulnerable software is Web Wiz Rich Text Editor version 4.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by BugReport.IR.
