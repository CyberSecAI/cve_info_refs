Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by stack buffer overflows present in the PhotoStockPlus Uploader Tool ActiveX control (PSPUploader.ocx). These overflows occur within multiple initialization parameters of the ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack buffer overflows in the ActiveX control's initialization parameters.
- The vulnerability can lead to the overwrite of the process's Structured Exception Handler (SEH).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- The attacker's code runs with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into viewing a specially crafted HTML document. This can be achieved through:
    - Malicious websites
    - HTML email messages
    - HTML email attachments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML document that exploits the stack buffer overflows.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious document using one of the attack vectors described.
- No authentication is required, and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
