Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0447
* **Vulnerable Software:** Foojan WMS 1.0
* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `story` parameter.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords, by injecting malicious SQL queries.
* **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `story` parameter in the URL.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit example provided demonstrates how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `authors` table, specifically the `UserName` and `PassWord` fields. The injection point is within the `story` parameter of the URL, for example: `http://Sitename/index.php?story=[SQL CODE]`. The provided SQL injection code is:
```sql
1'union/**/select/**/0,concat(0x55736572203a20,UserName,0x202b2050617373776f7264203a,PassWord),2,3,4,5,6,7,8/**/from/**/authors/*
```
This query bypasses the original intended SQL query, and crafts a new query that selects specified data and concatenates the `UserName` and `Password` fields.
