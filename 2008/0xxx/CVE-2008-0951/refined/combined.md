How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in Windows Explorer Could Allow Remote Code Execution (950582)

Published: July 08, 2008

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly reported vulnerability in Windows Explorer that could allow remote code execution when a specially crafted saved-search file is opened and saved. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Windows Explorer parses saved searches. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Affected Software**

| Operating System | Maximum Security Impact | Aggregate Severity Rating | Bulletins Replaced by this Update |

## Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1435

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when saving a specially crafted search file within Windows Explorer. This operation causes Windows Explorer to exit and restart in an exploitable manner.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1435](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1435).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1435

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open and save an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a malformed saved-search (.search-ms) file. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1435

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* Temporarily change the file type associated with the â.search-msâ file extension. Enter the following command at an elevated command prompt:

  assoc .search-ms=xmlfile

  **Impact of workaround.** Saved-search files will open as XML files in Internet Explorer.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Enter the following command at an elevated command prompt:

  assoc .search-ms=SearchFolder
* Modify the registry to deny users the ability to open saved-search files or to access the saved search folder.

  To modify the registry key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then expand the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\SearchFolder

#### FAQ for Windows Saved Search Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1435

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Explorer does not correctly parse search files when saving them.

**What is Windows Search?**

Windows Search is a standard component of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 that is enabled by default. Windows Search allows instant search capabilities for most common file and data types such as e-mail, contacts, calendar appointments, documents, photos, multimedia, and other formats extended by third parties. These capabilities enable consumers and information workers to more efficiently find, manage, and organize the increasing amount of data common in home and enterprise environments. For more information, see the [Windows Search home page](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/default.mspx). Although Windows Search is an add-in for Windows XP, Windows XP systems are not affected by this issue.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a userâs system. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open and save a specially crafted saved-search file with an affected version of Windows Explorer.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted saved-search file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file. After opening the file, the user would have to save the saved-search file in order for exploit to occur. The exploit occurs regardless of where the search is saved.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a saved-search file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Explorer parses saved searches to correctly validate the content structure of all saved-search files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2008-1435](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1435). This security bulletin addresses the publicly disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value

#### Vulnerability Note VU#889747

Original Release Date: 2008-03-20 | Last Revised: 2009-04-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value, which may prevent Windows from effectively disabling AutoRun and AutoPlay features.

### Description

| AutoRun, which was introduced with Windows 95, is a feature that causes Windows to automatically take an action when a removable media device is inserted. For example, when an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM is inserted, Windows may automatically execute a program on that disc. This also holds true for U3-enabled USB devices, which emulate a CD-ROM device as well as provide USB mass storage capabilities. These devices can automatically execute code when they are inserted into a Windows system. The AutoRun action can also take place when the user clicks the icon for an AutoRun-enabled device. AutoRun is enabled by default in Windows. AutoPlay, which was introduced with Windows XP, extends AutoRun capabilities to also allow a menu to be presented to the user, which lists actions that the user may take. AutoRun and AutoPlay can be disabled by setting the CDRom [Autorun](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/155217) registry value to 0 and also setting the [NoDriveTypeAutoRun](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/91525.mspx) registry value to 0xFF. The NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value is directly tied to the Group Policy setting for "Turn off Autoplay."  Microsoft Windows fails to properly handle the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value. According to Microsoft's documentation, setting NoDriveTypeAutoRun to 0xFF should disable AutoPlay for all types of drives. However, when this registry value is present, Vista enables some AutoPlay features that may not have been enabled prior to setting that registry value. For example, if NoDriveTypeAutoRun is set to 0xFF, Vista may execute a program specified in the Autorun.inf file when the device icon is clicked. Other values for NoDriveTypeAutoRun may also enable certain AutoPlay features in Vista. For Windows versions older than Vista, the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value is simply ignored with respect to certain AutoRun features. In other words, setting the value will not put the system at additional risk, but will not disable AutoRun completely. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Microsoft Windows may have some AutoPlay enabled, even though the Group Policy Editor and associated registry values indicate otherwise. This may allow an attacker to cause a user to inadvertently execute arbitrary code on a removable device, such as a USB drive.Certain versions of malicious code called Conficker or Downadup use the AutoRun feature to propagate. |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed for Windows Vista and Server 2008 systems in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS08-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-038.mspx). This update corrects the behavior of NoDriveTypeAutoRun on those platforms. Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003 users should install the update in Microsoft Support Document [KB967715](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715). Please also consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Disable AutoRun**With limited testing, it appears to be possible to disable AutoRun and AutoPlay on Microsoft Windows systems by saving the following text as a .REG file and importing it into the registry:REGEDIT4[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\Autorun.inf]@="@SYS:DoesNotExist"This registry value appears to prevent windows from parsing and taking actions based on the Autorun.inf file, which both AutoRun and AutoPlay utilize. Note that Windows can cache AutoRun capabilities of devices via the MountPoints2 registry key, though. So even after disabling AutoRun as described above, Windows may still automatically execute files on devices that Windows has listed in this cache. For this reason, we also recommend removing this cache by deleting the MountPoints2 registry key for each user:HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2Below are the original workaround settings that we had published. However, disabling the MCN message may prevent Windows from properly detecting when a CD-ROM is changed. Therefore, the above workaround may be more appropriate.     + Set the [Autorun](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/30300.mspx) registry value for CDs to 0. This will prevent Windows from sending a Media Change Notification (MCN) message when a CD-ROM is inserted, which will in turn prevent AutoPlay with these devices. + Disable AutoPlay for all media and devices, by clearing the **Use AutoPlay for all media and devices** setting in the Windows Control Panel. Details for how to do this are available in the [Windows Help and How-to](http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/40f23376-1351-49d5-8d48-5c05d35f2ac81033.mspx). + Do not set the [NoDriveTypeAutoRun](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/91525.mspx) registry values in HKLM or HKCU. If they are present, we recommend removing the values. This can be also be accomplished by using the Group Policy Editor to set the "Turn off Autoplay" option to "Not Configured." + Set the "Default behavior for Autorun" to Enabled - "Do not execute any autorun commands" in the Group Policy Editor.  The relevant settings in the Group Policy editor can be reached by running gpedit.msc and going to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> AutoPlay Policies. |
