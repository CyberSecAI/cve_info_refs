Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Windows' failure to properly handle the `NoDriveTypeAutoRun` registry value. This value is intended to disable AutoRun and AutoPlay features for various drive types, but it does not function as expected, particularly in Windows Vista and Server 2008. Instead of disabling AutoPlay completely, setting `NoDriveTypeAutoRun` to `0xFF` enables certain AutoPlay features, like executing programs specified in `Autorun.inf` when a device icon is clicked, which contradicts its intended purpose.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Registry Value:** Windows does not correctly interpret the `NoDriveTypeAutoRun` registry value. Setting the value to disable AutoPlay, instead, enables some of the functionality.
*   **AutoRun/AutoPlay Bypass:** The intended mechanism to disable AutoRun/AutoPlay is ineffective, allowing potential execution of code from removable devices, even when disabled by Group Policy, presenting a bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can leverage the vulnerability to cause a user to inadvertently execute arbitrary code from removable devices (USB drives, CD-ROM).
*   **Malware Propagation:** The vulnerability could be exploited to propagate malware (e.g., Conficker/Downadup), which use AutoRun for spreading.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Removable Media:** Attackers can place malicious code on USB drives, CD-ROMs and other removable media. When a user inserts this media, Windows could automatically execute the malware if the user clicks the icon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access/Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to get the malicious removable media into the userâ€™s possession. This might be achieved through direct physical access, or by convincing a user to use the malicious media.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the incorrect interpretation of the `NoDriveTypeAutoRun` registry value.
*   **Malicious Code:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious files to be placed on the removable media and executed by the autorun functionality.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed.
*   Microsoft released a security bulletin (MS08-038) to address this issue for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, which also covers the related CVE-2008-1435.
*   A fix for Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003 is provided in Microsoft Support Document KB967715.
*   Workarounds involved disabling AutoRun and AutoPlay features in Windows through registry changes or Group Policy settings.
