Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-submitted POST variables (`quality`, `angle`, and `clipval`) when processing images using ImageMagick in Coppermine Photo Gallery version 1.4.14. Specifically, the `rotateImage` function in `include/imageObjectIM.class.php` uses the `$angle` variable directly in a shell command without sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the `angle` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a remote shell command injection. Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the `angle` parameter, which are then executed by the server.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The vulnerable script `picEditor.php` is callable by anyone without proper permission checks, further amplifying the risk.
*   **ImageMagick Dependency:** The exploit requires that ImageMagick be configured as the image processing method (not the default GD library).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process (e.g., `nobody`, `apache`, or `www`).
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to copy the Coppermine configuration file containing database credentials to a publicly accessible location, enabling further compromise by an attacker.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially use the arbitrary command execution to gain full control of the server, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `picEditor.php` script.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:**  The attacker needs to provide specific values for the `newimage` (path to an existing image) and `angle` parameters. The `angle` parameter is used to inject commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Coppermine instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of this command injection vulnerability and how to craft the malicious request.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it accessible to any remote attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Janek Vind "waraxe".
*   The advisory ([http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-65.html](http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-65.html)) provides the details of this vulnerability.
*   The Coppermine development team released version 1.4.15 to address this security issue.

This vulnerability is a significant security concern because it allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full server compromise.
