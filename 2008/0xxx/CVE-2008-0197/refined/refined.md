Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability in WP-ContactForm plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in various fields within the WP-ContactForm plugin's settings page and contact form. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is persistent XSS. The plugin does not sanitize input in the following fields:
    *   `E-mail Address`
    *   `Subject`
    *   `Success Message`
    *   `Error Message`
    *   `wpcf_email`
    *   `wpcf_subject`
    *   `wpcf_question`
    *  `wpcf_answer`
    *  `wpcf_success_msg`
    *  `wpcf_error_msg`

*   **Insufficient Anti-automation:** Some versions of the plugin lack proper captcha implementation, making it vulnerable to automated attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Compromise:** By injecting malicious scripts into the settings fields (`E-mail Address`, `Subject`, `wpcf_email`, `wpcf_subject`, `wpcf_question`, `wpcf_answer`), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an administrator's browser session when they visit the plugin's options page. This could lead to the attacker gaining administrative control over the website.
*   **User Compromise:** By injecting malicious scripts into the `Success Message` and `Error Message` fields or `wpcf_success_msg` and `wpcf_error_msg`, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser sessions of regular users when they interact with the contact form. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
*   **CSRF+XSS attack:** Some vulnerabilities can be combined with CSRF to create more complex attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Requests:** Attackers exploit the XSS vulnerability by crafting POST requests containing malicious JavaScript payloads to the plugin's options page (`http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-contact-form/options-contactform.php`).
*   **Contact Form:** XSS is also possible through the contact form fields, impacting users who view the success or error messages after submitting the form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable plugin settings page.
*   No special privileges are required for the user-facing XSS, but they must be able to make a user submit the form.
*   For the admin-facing XSS, an admin must visit the plugin settings page

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerabilities are present in WP-ContactForm versions 1.5 alpha and prior, as well as 2.0.7 and prior.
* The XSS vulnerabilities are persistent because the malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed whenever the affected fields are rendered.
* The exploits can be used for educational purposes and to raise awareness.
* Some versions of the plugin also suffer from insufficient anti-automation due to the lack of captcha.
