    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2008-0693",
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_b44345ea_20250124_160454.html",
      "root_cause": "The PQCore service uses vswprintf to build log entries using network messages. The destination buffer for vswprintf is located on the stack and has a size of around 500 bytes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow in vswprintf.",
         "Lack of proper input sanitization/validation on network messages"
      ],
      "impact": "A denial of service (DoS) can be triggered by sending consecutive long messages to the service. This results in an error message box being displayed and the service stops accepting new messages. In some cases, manual termination and restart of the PQCore process may be required.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote. Attacker sends crafted network messages to TCP port 48101 of the vulnerable service.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the server running the vulnerable service on TCP port 48101."
