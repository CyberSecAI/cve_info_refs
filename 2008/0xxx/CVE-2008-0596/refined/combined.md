## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2008%3A0161)

## Topic

Updated cups packages that fix two security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX(R) operating systems.

A flaw was found in the way CUPS handled the addition and removal of remote
shared printers via IPP. A remote attacker could send malicious UDP IPP
packets causing the CUPS daemon to attempt to dereference already freed
memory and crash. (CVE-2008-0597)

A memory management flaw was found in the way CUPS handled the addition and
removal of remote shared printers via IPP. When shared printer was
removed, allocated memory was not properly freed, leading to a memory leak
possibly causing CUPS daemon crash after exhausting available memory.
(CVE-2008-0596)

These issues were found during the investigation of CVE-2008-0882, which
did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

Note that the default configuration of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4 allow requests of this type only from the local subnet.

All CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
CUPS is the default printer system on SUSE Linux.
The current security update of cups fixes a double-free bug in the function
process\_browse\_data() that can lead to a remote denial-of-service by crash-
ing cupsd or possibly to a remote code execution (CVE-2008-0882).
The bug can only be exploited if cupsd listens to 631/udp by crafted UDP
Browse packets.
Additionally two remote denial-of-service bugs were fixed. The first one
can be triggered via crafted IPP packets to use a pointer after it was
freed (CVE-2008-0597) and the second issue is a memory-leak caused by a
large number of requests to add and remove shared printers (CVE-2008-0596).
2) Solution or Work-Around
No work-around known. Please install the new cups package.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Restart the cups server after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

cups security update (RHSA-2008-0153)

Original Release Date: February 27, 2008

Last Revised: February 27, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-084

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is a suite of printing utilities for
UNIX ® operating systems.

CUPS was found to contain two vulnerabilities that could potentially lead the
cups daemon to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2008-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0597) and
[CVE-2008-0596](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0596) to these issues.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as the RHEL 3 cups package is not
installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0153.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with the RHEL 3 cups package installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied
by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

cups security update (RHSA-2008-0161)

Original Release Date: March 7, 2008

Last Revised: March 7, 2008

Number: ASA-2008-098

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is a suite of printing utilities for
UNIX ® operating systems.

CUPS was found to contain two vulnerabilitiesy in how it handled the adding
and removing of remote printers via IPP. A malicious remote user could send
specially crafted UDP IPP packets to the CUPS daemon, potentially causing it to
crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0597) and
[CVE-2008-0596](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0596) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0161.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with cups installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

| Avaya Voice Portal | VP 3.x | Low | Upgrade to VP 4.1 or later to remove the cups packages. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
