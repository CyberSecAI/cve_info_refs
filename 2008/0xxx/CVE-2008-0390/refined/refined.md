Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `stat.php` file of AuraCMS 1.62. The script uses the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header to determine the client's IP address without proper validation. Specifically, the code directly retrieves the value of the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header using `getenv("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR")` and uses it to write to the `online.db.txt` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or validation of the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into this header, including malicious PHP code.
- **Code Injection:** By injecting PHP code into the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header, the attacker can effectively write arbitrary PHP code into the log file (`online.db.txt`).
- **Remote Code Execution:** The injected code in the log file can then be executed by accessing the log file, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete server compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `index.php?pilih=stat&mod=yes` with a malicious PHP code injected into the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- This request is processed by `stat.php` which writes the injected code into `online.db.txt` file.
- The attacker then sends another request to execute the injected code by accessing  `index.php?pilih=online.db.txt%00&mod=yes&cmd=[command]`, where `[command]` is the command the attacker wants to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable AuraCMS server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
