Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_sermon` component of Mambo. Specifically, the `gid` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `gid` parameter, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, including usernames and passwords, from the `mos_users` table.
- Full Database Compromise: By extending the attack, an attacker could potentially manipulate and/or delete database data.
- System Compromise: It may be possible to leverage this vulnerability further to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `gid` parameter.
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `index.php` file and the `com_sermon` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a web browser.
- No Authentication Required: The exploit does not appear to require authentication.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and URL manipulation

**Technical Details**
The provided exploit string is:
`index.php?option=com_sermon&gid=-9999999%2F%2A%2A%2Funion%2F%2A%2A%2Fselect/**/concat(username,0x3a,password),0,0,username,password%2C0%2C0%2C0/**/from/**/mos_users/*`

This string injects a SQL query to extract username and password from the `mos_users` table, using a UNION SELECT statement, which leverages the improperly sanitized `gid` parameter.
