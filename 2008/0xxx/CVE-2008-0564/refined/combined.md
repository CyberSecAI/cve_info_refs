1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- powerdns spoofing problems
The PowerDNS packages were updated to offer better spoofing
resistance by not ignoring invalid queries. (CVE-2008-3337)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- dnsmasq spoofing problems
The DNS server dnsmasq was changed to use random UDP source ports
and a random TRXID now. (CVE-2008-1447)
This problem only affected openSUSE 10.2 - 11.0.
- python multiple problems
The scripting language python was updated to fix several security
vulnerabilities. (CVE-2008-1679,CVE-2008-1887, CVE-2008-3143,
CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-3144, CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-2316)
All SUSE Linux products received updated python packages.
- mailman cross site scripting
The mailing list manager mailman was updated to fix a
cross-site-scripting bug (CVE-2008-0564) and a mistake in
translation.
All distributions containing mailman received updated packages.
- ruby multiple problems
The scripting language ruby was updated to fix:
- a possible information leakage (CVE-2008-1145)
- a directory traversal bug (CVE-2008-1891) in WEBrick
- various memory corruptions and integer overflows in array and
string handling (CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2664,
CVE-2008-2725, CVE-2008-2726, CVE-2008-2727, CVE-2008-2728)
ruby was updated on all SUSE Linux products.
- Opera 9.52
Opera was upgraded to version 9.52 to fix possible security
vulnerabilities.
Please see <http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/952/> for
more details.
- neon NULL pointer problem
The helper library neon was updated to fix a NULL pointer dereference
in the digest authentication code. (CVE-2008-3746)
neon was updated on all affected distributions.
- rxvt-unicode session hijacking
Using rxvt-unicode it was possible to open a terminal on :0 when
the environment variable was not set.
This could be exploited by local users to hijack X11 connections (CVE-2008-1142).
rxvt-unicode was updated on openSUSE 10.2-11.0.
- perl multiple problems
Several problems were fixed in the scripting language perl.
Specially crafted regular expressions could crash perl
(CVE-2008-1927).
Insufficient symlink checks in the File::Path could result in wrong
file permissions (CVE-2008-2827).
Additionally problem in the CGI module was fixed that could result
in an endless loop if uploads were canceled.
- Wireshark / ethereal multiple security problems
Various vulnerabilities have been fixed in ethereal and wireshark:
CVE-2008-3137, CVE-2008-3138, CVE-2008-3139,
CVE-2008-3140, CVE-2008-3141, CVE-2008-3145
and CVE-2008-3146. Those could be potentially used to crash
wireshark or potentially execute code.
Updates have been released for all SUSE Linux distributions.
- namazu cross site scripting
The indexing engine namazu was upgraded to fix a UTF-7
cross-site-scripting vulnerability. (CVE-2008-1468)
namazu was updated on all products containing it.
- gnome-screensaver clipboard disclosure
gnome-screensaver was updated to disallows local users to
read the contents of the clipboard for a locked screen using
ctrl-v. (CVE-2007-6389)
Updates have been released for openSUSE 10.3, other distributions
were not affected.
- MySQL security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix a security problem:
CVE-2008-2079: MySQL allowed local users to bypass certain privilege
checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1)
DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within
the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are
created in the future.
CVE-2006-7232: sql\_select.cc in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.32 and 5.1.x
before 5.1.14 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
service (crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA
table, as originally demonstrated using ORDER BY.
MySQL was updated on all SUSE Linux distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# REGRESSION: mailman broken after security upgrade on gutsy

### Bug Description

A security update to mailman, fixing multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, caused mailman to fail to start due to a patching error. The following versions are affected:

  1:2.1.9-4ubuntu1.1 (Ubuntu 7.04)

  1:2.1.9-8ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu 7.10)

The update has been withdrawn (both by disabling downloads of the relevant files, and by removing the package from feisty-security and gutsy-security) pending corrective action, and the security team is testing a fix.

Original report follows:

I got the following output during an 'apt-get upgrade':

Happening to me too. It was also impossible to stop after that. I have to download the older .deb package and use dpkg -i (for some reason it stops the process) and recreate every lists.

Also seen here (gutsy, i386). Very serious, as it causes the daemon to fail, rendering lists inoperable.

The bug is obvious in the code (line 437 in /var/lib/mailman/Mailman/Gui/General.py):

The problem is in the incorrect 100\_CVE-2008-0564.patch in the debian/patches directory.

It removes the line 'val, mlist.preferred\_language)' from the file 'MailMan/Gui/General.py'.

My guess is, the patch was generated from a damaged General.py

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-586-1: mailman vulnerability

15 March 2008

mailman vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mailman](/security/cves?package=mailman) -

## Details

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in mailman.

A malicious list administrator could exploit this to execute arbitrary

JavaScript, potentially stealing user credentials.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [mailman](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman)
  -
  [1:2.1.9-8ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman/1%3A2.1.9-8ubuntu0.2)

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [mailman](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman)
  -
  [1:2.1.9-4ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman/1%3A2.1.9-4ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [mailman](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman)
  -
  [1:2.1.8-2ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman/1%3A2.1.8-2ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [mailman](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman)
  -
  [2.1.5-9ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mailman/2.1.5-9ubuntu4.2)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

NOTE: Due to an internal release testing mistake, earlier

published mailman versions 1:2.1.9-4ubuntu1.1 (for Ubuntu

7.04) and 1:2.1.9-8ubuntu0.1 (for Ubuntu 7.10) accidentally

included an incorrect patch and caused a regression, as reported in

<https://launchpad.net/bugs/202332>

This update includes fixes for the problem. We apologize for the

inconvenience.

Ihe subject of my previous post quoted below should have been "Mailman
2.1.10b3 Released". Sorry for the confusion.

Mark Sapiro wrote:
| I am happy to announce the second beta release of Mailman 2.1.10. For
| technical reasons, there was no 'b2' release.
|
| This is a security and bug fix release and it is highly recommended
| that all sites upgrade to this version.  Mailman 2.1.10 also adds support
| for two new language translations, Hebrew and Slovak and a few new
| features.
|
| Mailman is free software for managing email mailing lists and e-
| newsletters. Mailman is used for all the python.org and
| SourceForge.net mailing lists, as well as at hundreds of other sites.
|
| For more information, including download links, please see:
|

| <http://mailman.sf.net>
| <http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman>
|
| Special thanks are due to Barry Warsaw and Tokio Kikuchi for much coding
| and support, Moritz Naumann for help with security issues and Jim Tittsler
| for a significant patch.
|
| Changes since 2.1.10b1 include:
|
| ~  - Fixed cron/disabled to test if bounce info is stale before disabling a
| ~    member when the threshold has been reduced.
|
| ~  - Improved processing of backup/recovery of queue files.
|
| ~  - Updated mmdsr script.
|
| ~  - Updated Vietnamese and Danish translations.
|
| And here are the major changes from 2.1.9 that were included in 2.1.10b1:
|
| ~  Security
|
| ~    - The 2.1.9 fixes for CVE-2006-3636 have been enhanced.  In
| particular,
| ~      many potential cross-site scripting attacks have are now detected in
| ~      editing templates and updating the list's info attribute via the web
| ~      admin interface.  Thanks again to Moritz Naumann for assistance with
| ~      this.
|
| ~  New Features
|
| ~    - Changed cmd_who.py to list all members if authorization is with the
| ~      list's admin or moderator password and to accept the password if the
| ~      roster is public.  Also changed the web roster to show hidden
| members
| ~      when authorization is by site or list's admin or moderator password
| ~      (1587651).
|
| ~    - Added the ability to put a list name in accept_these_nonmembers
| ~      to accept posts from members of that list (1220144).
|
| ~    - Added a new 'sibling list' feature to exclude members of another
| list
| ~      from receiving a post from this list if the other list is in the
| To: or
| ~      Cc: of the post or to include members of the other list if that
| list is
| ~      not in the To: or Cc: of the post (Patch ID 1347962).
|
| ~    - Added the admin_member_chunksize attribute to the admin General
| Options
| ~      interface (Bug 1072002, Partial RFE 782436).
|
| Internationalization
|
| ~    - Added the Hebrew translation from Dov Zamir.  This includes
| addition of
| ~      a direction ('ltr', 'rtl') to the LC_DESCRIPTIONS table.  The
| ~      add_language() function defaults direction to 'ltr' to not break
| ~      existing mm_cfg.py files.
|
| ~    - Added the Slovak translation from Martin Matuska.
|

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
