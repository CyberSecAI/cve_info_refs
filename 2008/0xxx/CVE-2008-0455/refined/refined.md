{
  "Root cause": "Input sanitization flaw in the mod_negotiation module within the Apache HTTP server, specifically when handling filenames in '406 Not Acceptable' or '300 Multiple Choices' responses.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via unsanitized filenames when MultiViews is enabled.",
    "HTTP Response Splitting via CRLF injection within filenames."
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary HTML/webscript to perform XSS or inject arbitrary HTTP headers for HTTP response splitting, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking or other malicious actions. Denial of Service by malformed headers.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafting malicious filenames and uploading them to the server when MultiViews is enabled.",
      "Enticing user to visit malicious URL or using Adobe Flash to send crafted HTTP request."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files with arbitrary names to a directory on the server which has mod_negotiation's `MultiViews` option enabled and can make web requests to the server. Knowledge of HTTP protocol and web attacks (XSS and response splitting) is also required. Also need to know that MultiViews is enabled for a particular directory."
