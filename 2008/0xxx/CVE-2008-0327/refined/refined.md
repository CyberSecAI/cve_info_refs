{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter of the `show.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database. In this specific case, the attacker attempts to read the `pconfig.php` file which contains administrative credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to `show.php` with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
