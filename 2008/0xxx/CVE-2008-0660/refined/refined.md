```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control contains multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Stack-based buffer overflows in the ExtractExif and ExtractIptc properties, and potentially other properties as well.

Impact of exploitation:
Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user by convincing them to view a specially crafted HTML document. This could lead to full system compromise.

Attack vectors:
By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an attachment).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML document to a user and the user must be using a vulnerable version of the Aurigma ImageUploader ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
