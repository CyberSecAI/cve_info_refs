Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0682

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `wordspew-rss.php` file of the Wordspew WordPress plugin. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the 'id' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and password hashes), by manipulating the SQL query to access the `wp_users` table.
- **Database Manipulation:** It might be possible for an attacker to modify or delete data within the database, depending on the database user permissions.
- **Full Compromise:** In some scenarios and if proper conditions are met, full compromise of the underlying database might occur.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `wordspew-rss.php` file. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress installation.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests with modified URL parameters.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit involves using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `wp_users` table, specifically the `user_login` and `user_pass` fields, by crafting a URL like this :
   ```
   wordspew-rss.php?id=-998877/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/0,1,concat(0x7c,user_login,0x7c,user_pass,0x7c),concat(0x7c,user_login,0x7c,user_pass,0x7c),4,5/**/FROM/**/wp_users
    ```
- This allows the attacker to extract usernames and hashed passwords from the WordPress database.
