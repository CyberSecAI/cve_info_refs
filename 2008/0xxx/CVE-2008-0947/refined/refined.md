  "CVE-2008-0947": {
    "description": "The MIT krb5 Kerberos implementation includes a GSS RPC library used in the Kerberos administration server (kadmind). Two flaws exist in the libgssprc library that can cause an array overrun if too many file descriptors are opened. These flaws result in a vulnerability that could allow memory corruption in the kadmind server.  MIT notes that in software versions 1.4 and later, this flaw can only be exploited in configurations that allow large numbers of open file descriptors in a process. In software versions before 1.3, a similar flaw can be exploited in similar circumstances but is further limited to platforms that do not define certain macros in certain C system header files.",
    "root_cause": "Array overrun in the libgssrpc library due to insufficient bounds checking when handling file descriptors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check on file descriptor numbers before using them as array indices in libgssrpc."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption in the kadmind server, which can lead to a denial of service (crash). There's a theoretical possibility of database corruption or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote unauthenticated attacker sends requests to kadmind, potentially opening many file descriptors, triggering the overflow."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send network requests to the kadmind service. For versions 1.4 and later, the attacker needs to be able to force kadmind to open a large number of file descriptors. For older versions, the system also needs to not define certain macros."
