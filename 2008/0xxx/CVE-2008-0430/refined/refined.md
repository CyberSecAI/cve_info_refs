Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0430

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `form.php` script within the 360 Web Manager CMS. Specifically, the `IDFM` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user input from the `IDFM` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Complete Database Access:** An attacker may be able to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `form.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.

**Exploit Details:**
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `user` table. The `concat_ws` function concatenates the `name` and `password` columns.
*   The exploit URL provided as an example is: `http://www.360webmanager.com/form.php?IDM=2&IDSM=24&IDFM=-1+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x3a,name,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20+from+user/*`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit indicates that there might be more than 20 columns in the database table.
*   The admin login panel is located at `http://www.site.com/adm/login.php`.
