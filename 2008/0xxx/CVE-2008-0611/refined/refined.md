- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `images.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete database compromise. In this case, the example exploit is used to extract database and user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the `images.php` script with a crafted `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any special access to the application except to access the vulnerable script.
