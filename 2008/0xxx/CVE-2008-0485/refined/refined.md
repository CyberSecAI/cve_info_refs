           "technical_details": "The vulnerability occurs when parsing the 'stsc' atom tag. The 'trak->chunkmap' array is filled with data read straight from the file without checks. Later, the 'trak->chunkmap[i].first' field is used to index the 'chunks' heap array, allowing an attacker to write the 'sdid' and 'spc' values at a memory address related to that heap pointer, causing memory corruption. It's also possible to avoid allocation for 'trak->chunks', making it 0, allowing writing to almost any memory address. Specifically, the attacker can write at 'i*sizeof(chunk_t)+4' and 'i*sizeof(chunk_t)+8'."
