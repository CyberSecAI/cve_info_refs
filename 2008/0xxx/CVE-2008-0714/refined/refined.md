  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-0714",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_a37e4fdb_20250125_062616.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input within the `user_name` parameter in the `users.php` script, specifically within the lost password functionality.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Blind SQL Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including password hashes, by using a crafted SQL injection payload to cause a time-based delay based on the correctness of the characters of the password hash. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `users.php` script with a maliciously crafted `user_name` parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and have the ability to observe the response times, including whether a delay occurs based on their injection payload. They do not need to have any existing credentials for the application."
