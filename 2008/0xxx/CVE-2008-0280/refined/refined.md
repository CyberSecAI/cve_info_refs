Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in MTCMS version 2.0 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `a` and `cid` parameters in the `patch` script are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can bypass authentication, potentially gain access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords stored in the `users` table.
- This could lead to complete control of the application and its data.
- The attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable script.
- The specific vulnerable parameters are `a` and `cid` in the `patch` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated with the following URLs using a `union select` SQL injection:
  - `http://site.com/patch/?a='/**/union/**/select/**/1,concat(0x23,username,0x5f,password,0x23),email,4,5,6,7/**/from/**/users/**/where/**/id=1/*`
  - `http://site.com/patch/?a=downloads&cid='/**/union/**/select/**/1,concat(0x23,username,0x5f,password,0x23),email,4,5,6,7/**/from/**/users/**/where/**/id=1/*`
- The injection extracts username and password hashes from the `users` table.
- The injected query is designed to extract the username, password, and email from the `users` table where the id is equal to 1, but this could be modified by an attacker.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to extract the admin's username and password hash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit examples use `/**/` for comments which are processed by some SQL servers but also allow a payload to be URL encoded.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "hadihadi" of the Virangar Security Team.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 7.5/10, indicating a medium to high risk.
- The exploit is remote and has low attack complexity.
- The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is partial.
- The content suggests that there might be other vulnerabilities in other pages and possibly in other versions of MTCMS.
