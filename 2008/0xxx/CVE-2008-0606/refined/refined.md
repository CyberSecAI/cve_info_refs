Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0606

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `com_shambo2` component of Mambo (or possibly Joomla, given the reference) is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of the `Itemid` parameter in the `index.php` file.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `Itemid` parameter.
*   The application directly uses the unsanitized input within a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   This can lead to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
*   In this specific case, the exploit retrieves usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET method.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted URL containing the malicious SQL injection payload in the `Itemid` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mambo/Joomla application.
*   No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
* The provided exploit string is:
```
index.php?option=com_shambo2&Itemid=-999999%2F%2A%2A%2Funion%2F%2A%2A%2Fselect%2F%2A%2A%2F0%2C1%2Cconcat(username,0x3a,password)%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2F%2A%2A%2Ffrom%2F%2A%2A%2Fmos_users
```
* This URL crafts a SQL injection payload using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the `username` and `password` fields from the `mos_users` table.
