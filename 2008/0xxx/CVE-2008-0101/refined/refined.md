      "root_cause": "The application has two distinct vulnerabilities:\n\n1.  A buffer overflow in the `Scene::errorf` function.\n2.  A format string vulnerability in the `ImportFile` function.",
      "vulnerability": [
        {
          "weakness": "Buffer Overflow",
          "location": "Scene::errorf",
           "details": "The `Scene::errorf` function uses `vsprintf` to format a string into a fixed-size buffer (`buf`). If the formatted string exceeds the buffer size (1024 bytes), a buffer overflow occurs.  The overflowed buffer is then used in a subsequent `mysnprintf` call. The final result of the `mysnprintf` call is then appended to the `_compileErrors` variable. This  overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution."

          "weakness": "Format String",
           "location": "ImportFile",
          "details": "The `swDebugf` function is called with the `errors` variable as its argument, which is a user controlled string. This allows a format string vulnerability because the `swDebugf` function interprets the string as a format string, and allows the attacker to read and write to arbitrary memory locations. The vulnerable code is:  `swDebugf(errors);`"
