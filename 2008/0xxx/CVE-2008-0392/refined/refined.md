      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition 6 SP6 when handling .dsr files.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious .dsr file, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and execute arbitrary code when the file is opened in Visual Basic 6 and a specific action (clicking on connection or command name) is performed.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Local"
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted .dsr file and have the victim open the file using Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition 6 SP6 and click on either the connection or command name.",
		"moreDetails": "The exploit code provides a python script that generates the malicious .dsr file. It includes two options for exploitation: one via the 'ConnectionName' and the other via the 'CommandName'. The script crafts a buffer with overflow, including the address of 'call esp' instruction from user32.dll, some nops, and shellcode. Opening a .dsr file and clicking the vulnerable property trigger the vulnerability."
