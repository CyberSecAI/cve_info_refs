{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `searchtext` parameter within the `search.php` file before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation/sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure (e.g., usernames and passwords from the database), data manipulation, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `search.php` with a malicious payload in the `searchtext` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `search.php` file, which is publicly accessible in most cases."
