- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `user_id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. Two injection points are mentioned: one when modifying user profile, another one in the `gestion_membre.php` page through the `user_id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  
    - The attacker can gain administrative access by modifying the `niveau_num` for a user.
    - The attacker can potentially retrieve login credentials (username and password hashes) of other users from the database.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Modifying user profile page with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `selectskin` parameter during registration.
    - Directly accessing the `gestion_membre.php` page with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `user_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to create an account and log in.
    -  The attacker needs knowledge of the application's URL structure.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
