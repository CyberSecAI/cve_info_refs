Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue.
*   The `smarty.php` script in PHP Links <= 1.3 improperly handles the `full_path_to_public_program` parameter in the `require()` function. Specifically, it includes a file specified by this parameter without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `full_path_to_public_program` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored on the server, including configuration files, database credentials, or user information.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the web site content or redirect it to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious file path in the `full_path_to_public_program` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://target/phplinks/includes/smarty.php?full_path_to_public_program=Evil_script`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `full_path_to_public_program` parameter and its role in including files.
*   **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker needs access to a server that can host the malicious script to be included.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/includes/smarty.php` on line 2.
*   The exploit was published on January 30, 2008.

This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to include a file from a remote location which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
