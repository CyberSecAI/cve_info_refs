Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Although the content mentions both CVE-2008-0246 and CVE-2008-0245, the exploit code and description clearly target a vulnerability related to changing the admin password in UploadImage/UploadScript version 1.0. Since the content is about changing the admin password, and this is exactly what CVE-2008-0245 is about, we will assume that the content is referring to CVE-2008-0245 and the CVE-2008-0246 is a typo.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication or authorization in the `admin.php` script of UploadImage/UploadScript v1.0. Specifically, the `admin.php?act=nopass` functionality, intended for resetting the admin password, doesn't require prior authentication or any specific authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication for the admin password reset function. An attacker can directly access and exploit the password reset feature without being logged in or having any prior credentials.
- **Insecure Password Reset:** The password reset process appears to be directly changeable through a POST request to `admin.php?act=nopass` with the new password provided within the request. This is insecure because no user interaction or verification is required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Control:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to change the administrator password for the vulnerable application. This grants them complete administrative control over the affected application, allowing for actions such as manipulating content, settings and possibly gaining further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin.php?act=nopass` endpoint. This POST request contains the new desired password within the `pass` parameter.
- **Direct Access:** The attacker can access the vulnerable functionality directly by crafting a malicious request to the specific URL, without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `admin.php` file and the `act=nopass` parameter.
- **Ability to send HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker needs a tool or script to send HTTP POST requests with the appropriate parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code is written in PHP and demonstrates how to send the crafted POST request to exploit the vulnerability.
- The exploit code allows for setting the target host, path, and optionally a port and proxy.
- The exploit code hardcodes the new password to "123456" but could be easily modified to set a different password.
- The exploit does not appear to have any sophisticated attack techniques, simply making use of the missing access control on the password reset functionality.
