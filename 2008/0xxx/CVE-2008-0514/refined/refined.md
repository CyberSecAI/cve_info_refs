Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0514

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `com_glossary` component for Mambo (and likely also Joomla, based on the exploit description) is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `catid` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`catid` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** While not explicitly stated, successful SQL injection can often be leveraged to perform other malicious actions, such as modifying data, or even gaining further control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to `index.php`, specifically targeting the `com_glossary` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special access to the server or authentication is needed.
- **Basic understanding of SQL syntax:** An attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious request properly.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit provided demonstrates the following vulnerable URL:
```
index.php?option=com_glossary&func=display&Itemid=s@bun&catid=-1%20union%20select%201,username,password,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14%20from%20mos_users--
```
This URL exploits the vulnerability by:
1.  Setting `catid` to a negative value `-1`.
2.  Using `UNION SELECT` to inject a crafted SQL query that retrieves usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table (likely the user table in the application's database).
3. The `--` at the end comments out the rest of the original query, to ensure the injected query executes correctly.
