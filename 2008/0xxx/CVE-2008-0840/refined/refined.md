Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-0840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw within the LightBlog 9.6 application. The `view_member.php` script is vulnerable to this issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `username` parameter of the `view_member.php` script. This allows for path traversal.
*   **Path Traversal:**  An attacker can manipulate the `username` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** By exploiting this LFI vulnerability, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has access to. This can include sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to `view_member.php` with a malicious `username` parameter.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `username` parameter in the URL, including path traversal sequences like `../../` along with the target file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server running LightBlog 9.6.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must understand how to make HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be executed without any authentication on the web application.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit example provided in the content is `http://localhost/LightBlog9.6/view_member.php?username=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The `%00` is a null byte which can be used to bypass some security checks.

In summary, this is a classic LFI vulnerability that can have serious security implications for systems running vulnerable versions of LightBlog.
