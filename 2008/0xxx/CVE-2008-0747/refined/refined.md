Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0747:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow that occurs when parsing an .asx file with a long URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: The application does not properly handle excessively long URLs within .asx files, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: By providing a specially crafted .asx file with an overly long URL, an attacker can overwrite stack memory and cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious .asx file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious .asx file. This could be through a website, email, or other means of delivering the file.
- The attacker does not need special privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept shows how an URL with 1096 'A' characters overwrites ESI and crashes the application.
- The vulnerable application is identified as jetAudio <= 7.0.5.
