{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap buffer overflow in the `sdpplin_parse` function due to insufficient buffer size when parsing SDP data and a possible heap overflow when handling RTSP data on Windows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap buffer overflow in `sdpplin_parse` function when parsing SDP data.",
        "Possible heap overflow in RTSP data handling on Windows."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running VLC.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Maliciously crafted SDP data within an RTSP stream.",
        "Sending excessive bytes to the RTSP port on Windows."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker capable of sending a malicious RTSP stream or excessive data to the RTSP port."
