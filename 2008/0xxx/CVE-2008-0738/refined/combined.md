#### Testimonials

Let me first say one thing to you guys .. Using your software i have built my business from next to nothing into something so huge and successful. I have made a lil extra cash and moved into webhosting and a few other great projects happening soon. I don’t get a chance to use your forums as much as I use to but that’s probably more due to the fact the site is so stable and I haven’t had any major problems.

**Nin**

I’ve had this product for only a few weeks and it is the best out there. The ease of install is simple, the service is unprecidented, the ability to tweak and develop it is awesome. Well done CandyPress, I’m your number one fan and supporter.

**PJ**

Like any worthwhile relationship, a customer-vendor affiliation brings together ideas and common goals. Striking the delicate balance between likes and dislikes can sometimes be difficult. Two traits I hold in high regard personally and professionally are integrity and respect. Consequently, I am compelled to tell you that working with you is an absolute pleasure. Everything is upbeat and up-front. Business is tough, but not with people like you. Thanks for your support and wonderful product.

 **T.S.G.**

CandyPress made setting up payments in our dating app a breeze! We’ve tried other solutions in the past, and none have ever been as easy to implement. The support team is super friendly and helpful as well. Thanks CandyPress!
