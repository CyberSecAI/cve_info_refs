  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the parameters 'status', 'sort', and 'way' are vulnerable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to data, potentially including login credentials. The XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser. The CSRF vulnerability could allow an attacker to change the password of an admin account.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The SQL Injection vulnerability can be exploited through the `admin.php` script using the `msg` parameter, and the `search.php` script through the `status` parameter.",
        "The XSS vulnerability is triggered via the `view.php` script using the 's' parameter",
        "The CSRF vulnerability is exploited by tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a crafted web page."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "For the SQL injection in search.php, a valid user account is needed to initiate the search. For the CSRF attack, the attacker must trick a logged-in admin into visiting a specially crafted web page. For XSS, no login is required."
