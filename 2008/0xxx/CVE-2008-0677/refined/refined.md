Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `search.php` script is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Attack vector:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `words` parameter of the `search.php` URL.
    *   **Example:**  `http://Sitename/search.php?words=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&submit=Go`
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The `blog.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the `blog.php` URL.
    *   **Example:** `http://Sitename/blog.php?view=news&id=9999%27union/**/select/**/CoNcAt(0x4c6f67696e3a,name,0x3c656e64757365723e,0x0d0a50617373776f72643a,password,0x3c656e64706173733e)/**/from/**/site_administrators/*`
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, in this case, administrator usernames and passwords.

**Root Cause:**
*   **XSS:** Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `search.php` script before rendering it in the HTML output.
*  **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper input validation or sanitization of the `id` parameter in `blog.php`, allowing the attacker to inject SQL code.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   No special privileges or prior authentication are required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided code also includes a Perl script that demonstrates how to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability.
* The exploit script extracts the admin username and password and prints it to the console.
