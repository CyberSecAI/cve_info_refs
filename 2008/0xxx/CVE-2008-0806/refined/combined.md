How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: wyrd
Version: 1.4.3b-3
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi,
while searching for a cool calendar software I tried out
wyrd and noticed a wyrd file in /tmp that didn't look very
random. Looking at the source code it turns out that wyrd
dumps its configuration if you press ? (help) in the ui.
It then stores a file named wyrd-tmp.<userid> in /tmp.

rcfile.ml:
139 let tmpfile = "/tmp/wyrd-tmp." ^ (string_of_int (Unix.getuid ()))

An attacker only needs to look up the userid in /etc/passwd
and create a symlink from /home/victim/someimportantfile /tmp/wyrd-tmp.uid
and this will overwrite the content with the wyrd
configuration.

Unfortunately I have no idea about ML programming so I don't
have a solution for this.

A CVE id for this is pending.
Kind regards
Nico

Hi,
after Julien Cristau told me there is an open_temp_file
function in Ocaml and a bit reading of the Ocaml documentation I
can come up with a patch.

It will be also archived on:
<http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/wyrd-1.4.3b-3_1.4.3b-3.1.patch>

Kind regards

Hi,
attached is an updated patch.
It's as well archived on:
<http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/wyrd-1.4.3b-3_1.4.3b-3.1.patch>

The problem with the first patch was that if you press help
the second time you get Sys_error("Bad file descriptor").

The reason is that the original code only operates on the
filename, opens it and thus always assigning a new file
descriptor which gets closed afterwards. So after changing
this to the global file descriptor to make sure that the
file doesn't change in the meantime (race) the file
descriptor was closed after calling help the first time.

Fixed this by moving the close part to the file removal on
Quit and flushing the output after writing the content.

Kind regards
Nico

Thanks much for the patch. I've incorporated it into an updated
version and have uploaded and am closing this bug.

I'll also forward the patch on to upstream.

Thanks again,
