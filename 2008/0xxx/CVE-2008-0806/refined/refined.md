Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2008-0806:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `wyrd` application creates a temporary file in the `/tmp` directory using a predictable filename: `wyrd-tmp.<userid>`. The `<userid>` portion is simply the numerical user ID of the user running `wyrd`, easily obtained from `/etc/passwd`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The application uses a predictable temporary file name and doesn't use the `open_temp_file` function in Ocaml, creating a race condition and also allowing symlink attacks.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** By creating a symbolic link to the temporary file, a local attacker can redirect the output of wyrd into an arbitrary file on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can overwrite any file on the system that the user running `wyrd` has write permissions to. This can lead to data loss or compromise system integrity depending on the target file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where `wyrd` is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of Target User ID:** The attacker needs to know the user ID of the user who they wish to target, typically easily found in `/etc/passwd`.
*   **File Permissions:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory, and the user running `wyrd` needs to have write access to the target file the attacker wants to overwrite.
*  **Triggering Vulnerability**: The user must press the `?` (help) key in the `wyrd` UI to trigger the insecure temporary file creation.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Nico Golde and assigned CVE-2008-0806.
*   A patch was created and incorporated into `wyrd` version 1.4.3b-4.
*   The issue was addressed in Fedora 7 and 8 by updating the `wyrd` package.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `rcfile.ml`.
*   The fix involved using the `open_temp_file` function in Ocaml to create more secure temporary files, and ensuring the file descriptor wasn't closed until the application quit to prevent race conditions.
