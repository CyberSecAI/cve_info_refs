Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0735

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `gallery_data.php` file of AuraCMS v2.2. Specifically, the `$_GET['albums']` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization on the 'albums' parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Exposure: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion.
- User Credential Theft: As demonstrated in the exploit script, attackers can extract usernames and password hashes from the `useraura` table.
- Full System Compromise: In severe cases, successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise if the database user has elevated privileges and if the attacker can leverage that to execute operating system commands or to escalate privileges through other means.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `gallery_data.php` file with a malicious value in the 'albums' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the AuraCMS application.
- Basic Knowledge: A basic understanding of SQL and HTTP is needed to craft the malicious request and understand the server response.
- Magic Quotes Off: The exploit relies on `magic_quotes_gpc` being disabled.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is in `mod/gallery/ajax/gallery_data.php` (around line 200):
```php
$query = mysql_query ("SELECT * FROM `mod_gallery`  WHERE `kid` = '$albums' $SQL_SORT LIMIT $image,$limitimage");
```
The exploit script leverages this vulnerability by injecting SQL code into the `$albums` variable, such as `' union select user,2,3,4,5,6,7,password,9,10 from useraura/*`. This allows the attacker to bypass the intended query and extract sensitive data.

This vulnerability is specific to AuraCMS v2.2 and requires that magic quotes are off for exploitation.
