{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `id_catg` parameter within the `ViewCatg` operation of the NukeC module for PHP-Nuke. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes from the database. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the web application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id_catg` parameter of the NukeC module.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special position or high privileges are required."
