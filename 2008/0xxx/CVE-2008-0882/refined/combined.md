How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-598-1: CUPS vulnerabilities

2 April 2008

CUPS vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [cupsys](/security/cves?package=cupsys) -

## Details

It was discovered that the CUPS administration interface contained a heap-

based overflow flaw. A local attacker, and a remote attacker if printer

sharing is enabled, could send a malicious request and possibly execute

arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04.

In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile.

([CVE-2008-0047](/security/CVE-2008-0047))

It was discovered that the hpgl filter in CUPS did not properly validate

its input when parsing parameters. If a crafted HP-GL/2 file were printed,

an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user

in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be

isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0053](/security/CVE-2008-0053))

It was discovered that CUPS had a flaw in its managing of remote shared

printers via IPP. A remote attacker could send a crafted UDP packet and

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the

non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10,

attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0882](/security/CVE-2008-0882))

It was discovered that CUPS did not properly perform bounds checking in

its GIF decoding routines. If a crafted GIF file were printed, an attacker

could possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06

LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the

AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-1373](/security/CVE-2008-1373))

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [cupsys](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cupsys)
  -
  [1.2.8-0ubuntu8.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cupsys/1.2.8-0ubuntu8.3)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [cupsys](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cupsys)
  -
  [1.2.4-2ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cupsys/1.2.4-2ubuntu3.3)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-21 10:26:33 UTC  ``` Secunia has released and advisory affecting cups printing system:    <http://secunia.com/advisories/28994/>    Description:   A vulnerability has been discovered in CUPS, which can be exploited by   malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to potentially   compromise a vulnerable system.    The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the   "process_browse_data()" function when adding printers and classes. This   can be exploited to free the same buffer twice by sending specially   crafted browser packets to the UDP port on which cupsd is listening (by   default port 631/UDP).    Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.    The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.3.5. Prior versions may also   be affected.    Solution:   Update to version 1.3.6.  Upstream bug report: <http://www.cups.org/str.php?L2656>  Upstream patch: <http://www.cups.org/strfiles/2656/str2656.patch>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-21 10:42:14 UTC  ``` Further info from Tim Waugh:    In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5 we ship with 'BrowseAllow   @LOCAL' (the upstream default at the time), which causes CUPS to drop   UDP Browse packets from source IP addresses not matching a local subnet   (i.e. interface address & netmask, for each interface).    In Fedora we ship with 'BrowseAll All' in the CUPS configuration,   which allows all UDP Browse packets in.  Communication to 631/udp is allowed by default in iptables configuration.    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c7)  Mark J. Cox    2008-02-21 16:07:55 UTC  ``` We've determined through source code analysis that the older versions of CUPS as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 do not contain the code that can cause this double-free to occur.  We also tested this using a reproducer.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 does have the double-free and we can cause CUPS to remotely crash using an internal reproducer.  However the glibc pointer checking as part of Enterprise Linux 5 limits the exploitability of this issue to just a crash of CUPS and not the ability to execute arbitrary code.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c11)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-22 13:46:20 UTC  ``` cups-1.2.12-9.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c12)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-26 00:23:33 UTC  ``` cups-1.3.6-2.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c13)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-26 00:26:08 UTC  ``` cups-1.2.12-9.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=433758#c14)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-02-26 07:20:46 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0157.html>  Fedora:   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2008-1976>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2008-1901>   ``` |  |

# CUPS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS, allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.12-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.12-r7** |

### Background

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating
systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS:

* regenrecht (VeriSign iDefense) discovered that the
  cgiCompileSearch() function used in several CGI scripts in CUPS'
  administration interface does not correctly calculate boundaries when
  processing a user-provided regular expression, leading to a heap-based
  buffer overflow (CVE-2008-0047).
* Helge Blischke reported a
  double free() vulnerability in the process\_browse\_data() function when
  adding or removing remote shared printers (CVE-2008-0882).
* Tomas Hoger (Red Hat) reported that the gif\_read\_lzw() function
  uses the code\_size value from GIF images without properly checking it,
  leading to a buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1373).
* An unspecified
  input validation error was discovered in the HP-GL/2 filter
  (CVE-2008-0053).

### Impact

A local attacker could send specially crafted network packets or print
jobs and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running CUPS (usually lp), or cause a Denial of Service. The
vulnerabilities are exploitable via the network when CUPS is sharing
printers remotely.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.2.12-r7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
CUPS is the default printer system on SUSE Linux.
The current security update of cups fixes a double-free bug in the function
process\_browse\_data() that can lead to a remote denial-of-service by crash-
ing cupsd or possibly to a remote code execution (CVE-2008-0882).
The bug can only be exploited if cupsd listens to 631/udp by crafted UDP
Browse packets.
Additionally two remote denial-of-service bugs were fixed. The first one
can be triggered via crafted IPP packets to use a pointer after it was
freed (CVE-2008-0597) and the second issue is a memory-leak caused by a
large number of requests to add and remove shared printers (CVE-2008-0596).
2) Solution or Work-Around
No work-around known. Please install the new cups package.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Restart the cups server after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.

Package        : cupsys
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0047 CVE-2008-0882
Debian Bug     : 472105 467653

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in cupsys, the
Common Unix Printing System.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-0047
Heap-based buffer overflow in CUPS, when printer sharing is enabled,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted search
expressions.

CVE-2008-0882
Double free vulnerability in the process_browse_data function in CUPS
1.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted packets to the
cupsd port (631/udp), related to an unspecified manipulation of a
remote printer.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4etch3

We recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
