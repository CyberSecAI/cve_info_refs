{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation in the `index.php` file of phpShop. The application attempts to prevent SQL injection by filtering out certain SQL keywords. However, this filter can be bypassed by using comments (e.g., `/**/`) within the SQL injection payload.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Use of `stristr` for SQL keyword filtering which can be bypassed with comments.",
       "Lack of input sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote SQL Injection leading to potential data exfiltration or modification.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests by manipulating parameters such as `product_id`, `page`, etc.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpShop instance. No authentication is needed."
