      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-0103",
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_f291c886_20250125_002520.html",
      "root_cause": "A memory handling error occurs in Microsoft Office when a user opens a specially crafted Office file with malformed objects inserted. This error can corrupt system memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to malformed objects in Office files.",
        "Lack of proper input validation when loading documents with inserted objects."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file containing a malformed object. This can be achieved through email attachments or by visiting a malicious web site hosting such files.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file with a malformed object inserted. They then must convince a user to open this file, either through social engineering (e.g., sending as an email attachment) or by hosting it on a website."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-0103",
     "source": "marc.info_2d664729_20250125_002515.html",
     "root_cause": "The document indicates that this CVE is related to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that could allow remote code execution. It also states that the Storage Management Appliance (SMA) does not have this component, and therefore the patch will not run successfully.",
     "weaknesses": [
       "The vulnerability is associated with how Microsoft Office handles malformed objects which can lead to remote code execution"
      ],
     "impact": "The impact described is remote code execution, however it specifically states the SMA (Storage Management Appliance) does not have the vulnerable component, implying that the vulnerability would not impact systems where the SMA is installed.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is opening a specifically crafted Microsoft Office file which contains malicious objects, as previously outlined.",
      "required_capabilities": "The required attacker capabilities are to create and distribute such a malicious file to a target, however, this specific document states that this is not a concern for devices running the SMA software."
