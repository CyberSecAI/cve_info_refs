**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**After installing this update, why can I not remove it?**

An issue exists in Microsoft Office XP and Office 2003 that causes Office to be partially uninstalled when updates to certain components are installed or uninstalled. This update fixes that issue. However, when this update is uninstalled, the issue is reintroduced and Office is partially uninstalled. To prevent this behavior, Microsoft has marked this update as not uninstallable.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following Microsoft Support Lifecycle. For more information about the extended security update support period for these software releases, visit the Microsoft Product Support Services Web site.

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site, select the country, and then click Go to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ.

**I do not have the complete Microsoft Office suite listed in the Affected Software table, but only one of the component applications such as Word. Will my system be offered the security update?**

The vulnerability that is the subject of this security bulletin affects only the complete Microsoft Office suite listed in the Affected Software section. However, specific Microsoft Office applications use some of the same files as the complete Microsoft Office suite for which the security update applies. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. Why am I still being offered this update?**

Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the updated files for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that were delivered with Microsoft Office Service Pack 3. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

**Does the offer to update Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 constitute a flaw in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**What is included in the Microsoft Office Service Pack 3 update that causes the higher version of the update files?**

The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 and additional changes to support corporate environment changes. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0103](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0103).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Execution Jump Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0103

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Office Execution Jump Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0103

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Restrict access to VBE6.dll

  To restrict access to VBE6.dll, type the following at the command prompt:

  For Windows XP:

  ```
  Echo y|cacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  For Windows Vista:

  ```
  Takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll"
  Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /save %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT
  Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround:** The impact of implementing this workaround is that Microsoft Office files with VBA content (such as with macros) will no longer load.

  **How to undo the workaround:** To rollback this workaround, type the following at the command prompt:

  For Windows XP:

  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /E /R everyone

  ```

  For Windows Vista:

  ```
  icacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6\vbe6.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
  icacls "%ProgramFiles%\common files\microsoft shared\vba\vba6" /restore %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT

  ```
* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
