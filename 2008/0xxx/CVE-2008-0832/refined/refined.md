Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `surano` parameter of the Mambo Component Quran 1.1. The component fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `surano` parameter is directly used within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords (as demonstrated in the provided example). This can lead to unauthorized access to the application and potential further attacks.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Depending on database permissions, a successful injection could also allow the attacker to modify or delete data in the database.
*  **Complete Compromise:**  In severe cases, with sufficient database permissions, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the server by exploiting stored procedure vulnerabilities or using other advanced techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` file with the vulnerable `com_quran` component. The crafted URL includes a malicious SQL query within the `surano` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Mambo/Joomla server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to construct the malicious queries.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable component (Quran 1.1) and the parameter (`surano`) that is susceptible to SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the database by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement within the `surano` parameter:

*   For Mambo:
    `/index.php?option=com_quran&action=viewayat&surano=-1+union+all+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password ),3,4,5+from+mos_users+limit+0,20--`
*   For Joomla:
    `/index.php?option=com_quran&action=viewayat&surano=-1+union+all+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password ),3,4,5+from+jos_users+limit+0,20--`

These payloads leverage the `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to combine the results of the original query with a crafted query that selects `username` and `password` from the database user table.
The `concat` function is used to concatenate username and password, and the `limit 0,20` limits the number of records fetched from the user table.

The `0x3a` is the hexadecimal representation of a colon which is used to separate usernames and passwords in the output.

The `--` at the end of the SQL injection comment out the rest of the SQL query.

**Additional Information:**

*   The component was originally developed for PHP-Nuke, then ported to PostNuke and Mambo Open Source. This suggests that similar SQL injection vulnerabilities might be present in those versions too, although this particular exploit specifically targets Mambo and Joomla.
*   The content provides search strings (allinurl and inurl) to locate the vulnerable component.
*   The `milw0rm.com` reference indicates this vulnerability was reported and made public on the now defunct site.
