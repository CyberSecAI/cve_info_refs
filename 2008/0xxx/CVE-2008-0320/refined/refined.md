Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0320:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content from openoffice.org, ubuntu.com, debian.org, and gentoo.org all mention CVE-2008-0320, specifically relating to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenOffice.org when parsing OLE files. This aligns with the official description of CVE-2008-0320, making the content relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenOffice.org processes OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) files. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur when parsing the "DocumentSummaryInformation" stream within the OLE file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Heap-based buffer overflow: The application allocates a buffer on the heap to store data from the OLE file. Due to insufficient bounds checking, a specially crafted OLE file can write beyond the allocated buffer, causing a heap overflow.
   - Integer underflow:  One of the documents also mentioned an integer underflow leading to excessive loop and stack based overflow, although not specifically for CVE-2008-0320.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org. This means the attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system.
   - Denial of Service: While not the primary impact, a buffer overflow could also potentially cause a denial of service by crashing the application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - Malicious OLE File: The primary attack vector is a specially crafted OLE file. An attacker could send this malicious file to a target user, who, upon opening the file with OpenOffice.org, triggers the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - Remote Attacker: The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by opening a file provided by the attacker.
   - User Interaction Required: Exploitation requires the user to open the malicious OLE file using a vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org. The attacker needs to entice or trick the user into opening the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all OpenOffice.org versions prior to 2.4.
- The vulnerability is acknowledged and patched in OpenOffice.org 2.4 and later.
- The Secunia content highlights that their team discovered the vulnerability and has been acknowledged in OpenOffice.org advisories.
- The Ubuntu content groups multiple CVEs into one update, showcasing multiple vulnerabilities being patched together.
