```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses user-supplied input from the 'page' parameter in the URL without proper sanitization, directly including the input with a ".html" extension.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors:  By crafting a malicious URL with a 'page' parameter pointing to a remote file containing executable code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special access or position is required.
