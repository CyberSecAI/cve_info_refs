```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `editevent.php` file in the WP-Cal plugin directly uses the `id` parameter from the GET request in a SQL query without sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability in the `editevent.php` file.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to information disclosure (e.g., extracting user credentials from the `wp_users` table).
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a modified `id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site and plugin.
