How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : turba2
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0807
Debian Bug     : 464058

Peter Paul Elfferich discovered that turba2, a contact management component
for horde framework did not correctly check access rights before allowing
users to edit addresses.  This could result in valid users being able to
alter private address records.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.3-1etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-1sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your turba2 package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: turba2: Access rights not checked properly
Date: Mon, 04 Feb 2008 23:23:50 +0100
```
Package: turba2
Version: 2.1.3-1
Severity: normal

Access rights do not seem to be checked properly before allowing a user
to edit address data as illustrated in the following example:

A user adds an address from his or her personal addressbook to a contact
list in a shared address book. Now anybody who has write access to the
shared address book can also edit this person's address data in the
user's personal addressbook.

In fact, after manually entering an object_id (which I looked up in the
database) from somebody else's address book I found I could edit this
data as well.

So it seems that when edit.php is passed an object_id, the owner_id and
the requesting user's access rights to the addressbook that the owner_id
refers to aren't checked. Apparantly knowing the object_id is enough to
be able to edit any address! I guess this is left over from the time
address books couldn't be shared yet, based on the assumption that
people wouldn't be able to guess the pseudo random 32 character id's.

I test your patch with success. I have now a "no results" message
when I try to edit a contact owned by a different user.

(Note: I Cc: Debian BTS because it's an unembargoed bug ;)

Hey Chuck, Gregory,

I've also tested the patch. It successfully secures the data, but it also
silently removes the non editable contacts from contact lists as the list is
viewed.  Are you or are you not supposed to be able to add contacts from one
address book to a contact list in another address book? If not then users
should also no longer be able to add contacts to contact lists from other
address books.

Regards,

Peter Paul

Could you give more details (sources.php, etc.) on this problem ?

Thanks for the detailed description. I think the simplest fix here is
to just not remove people from the shared list. If someone in a
contact list is not in an addressbook you're allowed to see, then I
don't think you should see them.

Does that sound reasonable?

That seems possible - "This list contains X contacts that you do not
have permission to view. Contact the list's owner if you have
questions." or something like that?

Hey,

We just use a single, default, 'localsql' configuration (with use_shares =>
true).

Steps to reproduce this:
- Login as user A
- Select an entry from your private address book
- Select a contact list that is stored in a shared address book and click
'Add'
- You can view the contact list to check the address was added
- Logout and log back in as user B with access to the shared address book,
but not to user A's private address book
- View the same contact list and the address will have disappeared
- Logout and log back in as user A
- View the same contact list and the address to check the address has really
disappeared

I also verified this by looking at the entry data in the database. The entry
key is removed from the serialized object_members array of the shared
contact list at the moment user B views the contact list.

This wouldn't be a problem if it wouldn't be possible to add entries from
(in this case) your private address book to a contact list in a shared
address book. So I figure that should be patched as well.

Regards,

Peter Paul

That would perhaps be a simpler fix, but I think it will be confusing to
users.
If you really want to allow this cross-address-book adding then I'd suggest
showing warning messages detailing why a number of contacts could not be
displayed. Or, at the moment of adding an entry to a list in another address
book, create a copy of the entry in that address book and add the copy to
the list instead.

Regards,

Peter Paul

It's not so much the list's owner as the entry's owner, which could be
another shared address book, so that would turn into:
"This list contains X1 contacts from address book 'Y1' that you do not have
permission to view. Contact the owner (Z1) if you have questions." And so
forth for X2, Y2 and Z2 etc. Where X is the number of contacts, Y is the
name of the source address book and Z1 is the owner of the address book or
share.

Peter Paul

PS: I did another test with an interesting outcome by the way: if the
address added to a list is from a shared address book that another user can
not see/read, then it isn't shown, but it's not removed. So the silent
removal only seems to take place with addresses from private address books.

New patch attached from Michael Rubinsky. That wording is a bit
verbose and also intensive on the list code. I'd prefer to provide a
general help link to a description of share permissions.

I don't use use_shares anywhere then I can't do a fast test now.
I was waiting a feedback from Peter, original bug submitter.
If not, I will test your patch, but probably not before thursday.

Sorry, got a little sidetracked with other stuff.

I tested Rubinsky's patch and it seems to work fine. I'd still prefer to be
able to find who I'd have to contact to be able to see these invisible
entries though. I already know I'm going to get support requests about this
and right now the only way to find out who's responsible is for me to dive
into the database and figure it out manually.

Regards,

Peter Paul

I agree it would be nice, but that's more in the realm of an
enhancement than a security fix. We'll consider it for Turba 2.2, but
I'd like to get 2.1.7 out with the fixes now.

Thanks,

Finally, these should be the patches for the upcoming Turba 2.1.7 and
Turba 2.2-RC3 releases. I plan to roll them tomorrow (Friday) morning,
U.S Eastern time. I'm also attaching a patch for HEAD for anyone who
wants/needs it.

Thanks to Peter, and also Michael R. for the count checks.

Thanks a lot for your final patches. Turba 2.1.7 is already in
Debian unstable distribution. But for Debian stable and
oldstable, I can't upload version 2.1.7: I need backport
security changes. Could you review my backported patches?

- Patch for Turba 2.1.4 (Debian stable):
<http://gcolpart.evolix.net/debian/turba2/turba2_2.1.3-1_2.1.3-1etch1.diff>

- Patch for Turba 2.0.2 (Debian oldstable):
<http://gcolpart.evolix.net/debian/turba2/turba2_2.0.2-1_2.0.2-1sarge1.diff>

Note: FYI, Debian security team requested CVE id for this security issue.

I don't feel qualified without a _lot_ more time to review the 2.0.x
patch; that is very, very different from the current code.

The 2.1.4 patch seems to have a bunch of extra stuff in it - I would
just do the changes to Group.php, sql.php, and browse.php. If you're
also including different fixes those would have to be reviewed
separately - those changes are a bit harder to follow.

> Note: FYI, Debian security team requested CVE id for this security issue.

We got the report from you, so unless you created one I don't think
there is one. Or do you mean that they started the process of creating
one from CVE?

I apologize because this patch includes *two* security patches:
- [jan] SECURITY: Fix privilege escalation in Horde API => from 2.1.6
- [cjh] SECURITY: Fix unchecked access to contacts in the same
  SQL table (Bug #6208). => from 2.1.7 (patch spoken in this thread)

For 2.0.2, I include one more security patch:
- [cjh] Close several XSS vulnerabilities with address book and
  contact data. => from 2.0.5

For easy reviewing, I include comments in my patches like:
--8<--
// backport security patch from Turba 2.*.*
--8<--

Yes, they started the process of creating one. We're waiting it.

  A shining example of how to handle security updates. Thanks very
 very much for the fixed packages, and the clear writeup.

  I"ll upload them today, and handle the release when they are
 done.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-08 14:19:22 UTC  ``` It was reported that turba does not properly check permissions on address books, allowing users to modify addresses in other users' address books.  This problem affects both shared and non-shared address books.  Knowing (or guessing) the object_id seems to be sufficient to allow modification of other users' addresses.  More information can be found in Debian bug report, which also contains some proposed patches: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=464058>  Upstream bug report: <http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/?id=6208>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c1)  Robert Buchholz    2008-02-16 01:51:07 UTC  ``` Turba 2.1.7 is out with the patches, final versions can also be found at Debian's.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-18 16:44:21 UTC  ``` Thanks Robert.  From news section on project upstream page:    2008-02-15: The Turba Contact Manager versions H3 (2.2-RC3) and H3 (2.1.7)   have been released. These are security releases that fix unchecked access to   contacts in the same SQL table, if the unique key of another user's contact   can be guessed.  Patch in Debian BTS: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=94;filename=turba_2.1.7.patch;att=3;bug=464058>    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c4)  Lubomir Kundrak    2008-02-26 08:00:24 UTC  ``` Brandon: Ping. Do you need help doing the fix?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c5)  Jan ONDREJ    2008-02-26 09:45:32 UTC  ``` Update build in koji.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c6)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-26 10:03:45 UTC  ``` imp-4.1.6-1.fc7,horde-3.1.6-1.fc7,turba-2.1.7-1.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c7)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-26 10:12:38 UTC  ``` horde-3.1.6-1.fc8,turba-2.1.7-1.fc8,imp-4.1.6-1.fc8 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 8   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-26 10:15:52 UTC  ``` Thanks Jan!  Bodhi will take care of closing this bug once updates are pushed to stable repositories.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c9)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-28 21:35:25 UTC  ``` imp-4.1.6-1.fc7, horde-3.1.6-1.fc7, turba-2.1.7-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=432027#c10)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-28 21:41:26 UTC  ``` horde-3.1.6-1.fc8, turba-2.1.7-1.fc8, imp-4.1.6-1.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
