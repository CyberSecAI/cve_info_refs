  "cveId": "CVE-2008-0807",
  "description": "lib/Driver/sql.php in Turba 2 (turba2) Contact Manager H3 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2-RC3, as used in products such as Horde Groupware before 1.0.4 and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition before 1.0.5, does not properly check access rights, which allows remote authenticated users to modify address data via a modified object_id parameter to edit.php, as demonstrated by modifying a personal address book entry when there is write access to a shared address book.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access right checks in the `lib/Driver/sql.php` file when handling requests to edit address book entries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Insecure direct object reference (IDOR)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote authenticated users can modify address data of other users, potentially leading to information tampering and a breach of privacy.",
    "attackVectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a modified `object_id` parameter in a request to `edit.php`, thereby bypassing intended access restrictions.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application. Additionally, the attacker needs to know or be able to guess the `object_id` of the contact they wish to modify. The attacker must have write access to at least one shared address book. This access then allows them to alter other user's private address entries which have been added to the shared address book."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Turba 2.1.x before 2.1.7",
    "Turba 2.2.x before 2.2-RC3",
    "Horde Groupware before 1.0.4",
     "Horde Groupware Webmail Edition before 1.0.5"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Turba 2.1.7",
    "Turba 2.2-RC3",
     "Horde Groupware 1.0.4",
     "Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.0.5",
    "Debian sarge: turba2 2.0.2-1sarge1",
    "Debian etch: turba2 2.1.3-1etch1",
    "Debian unstable: turba2 2.1.7-1"
  ],
  "additionalInformation": "The vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker could guess the `object_id` of another user's contact. Furthermore, adding a user's private address to a shared address book also enabled the ability to edit that entry via the shared address book and associated write permissions. Patches include fixes for multiple other vulnerabilities including XSS and privilege escalations in Horde API.",
