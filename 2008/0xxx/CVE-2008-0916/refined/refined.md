Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `com_hwdvideoshare` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `cat_id` parameter in the `index.php` URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames and passwords.
- **Complete Database compromise:** By injecting a more malicious SQL payload the attacker can add, modify, or delete data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker may also escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `cat_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla installation.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable component and its parameters is required.
- While the exploit mentions that sometimes login is required, it's unclear if this vulnerability requires authentication or if it's exploitable by anonymous users.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit URL provided demonstrates the SQL injection:
  ```
  index.php?option=com_hwdvideoshare&func=viewcategory&Itemid=S@BUN&cat_id=-9999999/**/union/**/select/**/000,111,222,username,password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2/**/from/**/jos_users/*
  ```
  - This URL attempts to inject a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `username` and `password` fields from the `jos_users` table.
