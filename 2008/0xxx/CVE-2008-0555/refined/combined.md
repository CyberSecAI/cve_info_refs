http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0555
Vendor: Adam & Ben Laurie
Product: Apache-SSL
Website: http://www.apache-ssl.org
Vulnerability: memory disclosure, potential privilege escalation in web
applications
Class: remote
Status: patched
Severity: low
Releases known to be affected: apache\_1.3.34+ssl\_1.57
Releases known NOT to be affected: apache\_1.3.41+ssl\_1.59
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Background:
Apache-SSL is a secure Webserver, based on Apache and SSLeay/OpenSSL.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Overview:
Apache-SSL provides environment variables that are filled with
(client) certificate data. If the subject of a client certificate
contains special characters, parts of these variables can be overwritten
or be filled with other parts of memory.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Technical details:
The certificate DN as returned by the OpenSSL X509\_NAME\_online is
passed into the following function:
static void ExpandCert(pool \*p,table \*pEnv,char \*szPrefix, char \*szDN, char \*szCert)
{
char buf[HUGE\_STRING\_LEN];
char \*s,\*t;
/\* Expand a X509\_oneline entry into it's base components and register
them as environment variables. Needed if you want to pass certificate
information to CGI's. The naming convention SHOULD be fairly compatible
with CGI's written for stronghold's certificate info - Q \*/
/\* FIXME - strtok() and strcspn() may cause problems on some systems - Q \*/
ap\_table\_setn(pEnv,szDN,ap\_pstrdup(p,szCert));
ap\_cpystrn(buf,szCert,sizeof buf);
for(s=strtok(buf,"/") ; s != NULL ; s=strtok(NULL,"/"))
{
int n=strcspn(s,"=");
s[n]='\0';
StrUpper(s);
t=ap\_pstrcat(p,szPrefix,s,NULL);
ap\_table\_setn(pEnv,t,ap\_pstrdup(p,s+n+1));
}
}
The function assumes that the relative distinguished name does not
contain a '/'. If a / is contained in for example the common name,
strcspn(s,"=") returns the size of s, so s+n+1 points beyond the
current token.
Furthermore, environment variables can be overwritten by including '/'
and '='. For example, to overwrite the OPENSSL\_S\_CLIENT\_DN\_OU variable,
one could use a certificate with a CN of "/OU=Fake OU".
If an application relies on this information to distinguish certificates
into different authorization classes, it can be fooled this way.

Communication:
\* 17.01.2008: Reported the bug to Ben Laurie
\* 17.01.2008: Ben replies and acknowledges the bug
\* 01.02.2008: Checking back with Ben on the status
\* 01.02.2008: Ben replies that he'll be looking into a patch over the weekend
\* 06.02.2008: Ben sends patch and asks for help with testing it
\* 07.02.2008: Reply with test results (still a small problem unrelated to
the original issue)
\* 09.02.2008: Ben sends updated patch
\* 11.02.2008: Told Ben that patch works fine
\* 18.02.2008: Requested update
\* 18.02.2008: Ben replies that he'll deal with it in the next week or so
\* 27.02.2008: Requested update
\* 27.02.2008: Patch for Apache 1.3.41 is ready, but release is normally
managed by Adam Laurie, who is on holiday till March, 11th
\* 28.02.2008: Agreed to wait for Adam to return
\* 12.03.2008: Ben informs Adam of the new release
\* 25.03.2008: Requested update
\* 25.03.2008: Ben replies, they are waiting for an updated advisory from me
\* 25.03.2008: Sent out updated advisory
\* 27.03.2008: Adam says sorry for the delays and that he will try to work
on this while he is at "a conference in Amsterdam"
\* 01.04.2008: Coordination with Adam and Ben on a release
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Solution:
Upgrade to apache\_1.3.41+ssl\_1.59.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[How to recover a deleted file in windows 11(the file is very precious to be lost)](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i8xnfb/how_to_recover_a_deleted_file_in_windows_11the/)

[I don't understand what's just happened.I had a very precious 13.5 GB file of pictures on my laptop(in d drive), so I decided to copy it to a USB flash drive as a backup (because I’ve had a few nasty similar instances in the past). So it started copying, it Said that it would take around 20 mins so I just opened valorant and go do some work but after I came I say that valo was minimized and copy/paste bar was not showing i thought it might have stopped due to some error so I checked file size in flash drive and it was 4.5 gb which less than half of the original . So i decided to delete the file in the flash drive and paste again .so I tried to delete the partially copied file on the USB drive but I saw in delete window that copying process is going. Since it was still in the middle of copying, the file didn’t delete.

I stopped the copying process and then deleted the partially copied file on the USB to start the process again. However, when I went back to the source location on my laptop, the original file was gone! It’s not in the Recycle Bin either.

I’m completely baffled and don’t understand what happened. Does anyone know where the file might have gone or how I can recover it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

And I have not touched my laptop since as it could hinder any recovery ways.](/r/DataRecoveryHelp/comments/1i8xnfb/how_to_recover_a_deleted_file_in_windows_11the/)
