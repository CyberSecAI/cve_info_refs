Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Skype client fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input received from the SkypeFind service, specifically the "full name" field. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of adequate filtering or sanitization of user-supplied data within the SkypeFind full name field.
- **Script Injection:** The vulnerability enables script injection, allowing an attacker to embed malicious code within the full name field of a SkypeFind profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because the injected script runs in the Internet Explorer Local Machine Zone, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This is based on the information provided in the cross-referenced VU#248184.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SkypeFind Service:** The attack vector is through the SkypeFind service, where an attacker submits a specially crafted profile with malicious script in the "full name" field.
- **Viewing Malicious Profile:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the attacker's crafted SkypeFind profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Skype Account:** The attacker needs a Skype account to create a profile on the SkypeFind service.
- **Ability to Manipulate Profile:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the full name field on SkypeFind to inject malicious script.
- **No User Interaction:** Once the malicious profile is created, the exploit can be triggered when other users view the profile without additional interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document references another vulnerability note, VU#248184, which explains the implications of script execution in the Local Machine Zone.
- The vulnerability is addressed by filtering input supplied to the SkypeFind service.
- The document also suggests blocking the `skype:` URI handler as a mitigation measure.
- The vulnerability was made public by Aviv Raff.
- This vulnerability is associated with CVE-2008-0583 and CVE-2008-0582.
