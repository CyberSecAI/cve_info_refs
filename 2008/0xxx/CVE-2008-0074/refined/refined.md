```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists in the way that the Internet Information Service (IIS) handles file change notifications in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, and WWWRoot folders.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A local elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to improper handling of file change notifications.
  - Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can gain full control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.
  - Attack vectors: A local attacker needs to create or modify a file in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, or WWWRoot directory. A remote attacker needs to upload and run a script with write access to the vulnerable directories.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A local attacker needs to have the ability to create/modify files in specific IIS directories. A remote attacker needs to upload and execute a script on the server with the write access to the mentioned directories.
