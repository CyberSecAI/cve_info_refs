## File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074

A local elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Internet Information Service handles file change notifications in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, and WWWRoot folders. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of local system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0074](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0074).

#### Mitigating Factors for File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* On Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, the IUSR\_MACHINENAME account (used for anonymous access) does not have write access to the WWW root folders by default.
* The specially crafted file or folder that would be required to exploit this vulnerability must be created locally. It could not be created through an FTP client connected to the FTP server service.
* On Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista, IIS is not installed or enabled by default.

#### Workarounds for File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **On Windows Server 2003, stop the FTP and NNTP services**

  Exploitation of this vulnerability would require that the attacker have write access to the FTP root or NNTP root folders. By default the IIS anonymous access account, IUSR\_MACHINENAME, has write access to the FTP root and NNTP root folders. Stopping these services will prevent the FTP and NNTP services from responding to change notifications for files in those directories. To stop the FTP and NNTP services, follow these steps:

  From a command prompt, run the following commands:

  `net stop msftpsvc`

  `net stop nntpsvc`

  **Impact of workaround.** Users will be unable to use the FTP and NNTP services.

  **How to undo the workaround.** To undo the workaround, follow these steps:

  From a command prompt, run the following commands:

  `net start msftpsvc`

  `net start nntpsvc`
* **Deny write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders for any accounts that are used to execute user controlled ASP pages.**

  Verify that the WWW root folder does not allow write access for any accounts used to execute user controlled ASP pages. To deny write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders follow these steps:

  **Note** The ACLs of the WWW root folder should be verified to ensure that anonymous access user accounts do not have write access.

  **Note** The following commands will deny the IIS anonymous user account write access to the default FTP and NNTP root directories of a machine named WS2003ENTSP1.

  From a command prompt, run the following commands:

  cacls c:\inetpub\ftproot /E /P IUSR\_WS2003ENTSP1:R

  cacls c:\inetpub\ftproot /E /P USERS:R

  cacls c:\inetpub\nntpfile\root /E /P "ANONYMOUS LOGON":R

  cacls c:\inetpub\nntpfile\root /E /P EVERYONE:R

  **Impact of workaround.** Users will be denied write access to the NNTP root, FTP root, and WWW root folders for any accounts that are used to execute user-controlled ASP pages.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Restore the ACLs on the folders to their previously configured setting.

#### FAQ for File Change Notification Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0074

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of local system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that the Internet Information Service handles the file change notifications in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, and WWWRoot folders.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

A local attacker could successfully exploit this vulnerability to gain full control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

A local attacker would have to be able to create or modify a file only in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, or WWWRoot directory. Virtual directories and sub-directories are not affected. A remote attacker would have to be able to upload a script to an affected IIS server, and be able to run the script. This uploaded script would need write access to the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, or WWWRoot folders.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Web hosting providers that allow their customers to upload ASP pages to their hosted web sites are primarily at risk from exploitation of this vulnerability. In addition, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems running IIS 5.0 are at risk from this vulnerability because IIS is enabled by default. Supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista are also at risk if the service is enabled.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Internet Information Service handles file change notifications in the FTPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, and WWWRoot folders.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Note** For a complete list of supported versions, see the [Support Lifecycle Index](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeselectindex/). For a complete list of service packs, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifesupsps). For more information on the support lifecycle policy, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

### Other Information

#### Support

* Customers in the U.S. and Canada can receive technical support from [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21131) at 1-866-PCSAFETY. There is no charge for support calls that are associated with security updates.
* International customers can receive support from their local Microsoft subsidiaries. There is no charge for support that is associated with security updates.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages so the foregoing limitation may not apply.

#### Revisions

* V1.0 (February 12, 2008) Bulletin published.
* V1.1 (February 13, 2008) Bulletin updated: Corrected the download link reference for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2 to reference Internet Information Services 6.0. The download link correctly directed customers to the IIS 6.0 update but the reference link incorrectly stated IIS 5.1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
