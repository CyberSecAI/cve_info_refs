Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2008-0665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files within the `wml_backend/p1_ipp/ipp.src` file of the Website META Language (WML). The program creates temporary files using predictable names in a shared directory (`/tmp`), making them vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The code uses a predictable file name (`ipp.$$.tmp`) in `/tmp`, which can be targeted by a malicious user.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** An attacker can create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file with the same name as the temporary file. When the vulnerable program attempts to write to this temporary file, it will instead overwrite the target of the symlink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable program (WML). This can lead to a denial of service by corrupting important system files or configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable WML application is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Program:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable WML program's temporary file naming pattern.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Frank Lichtenheld and Nico Golde.
*   The issue was addressed by using the `mkdtemp()` function to create temporary directories and using more secure methods for file creation.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2008-0666, which affects other parts of the WML code.
*   The fix was implemented in version `2.0.11-r3` of the `dev-lang/wml` package in Gentoo, in version `2.0.11-1etch1` for Debian etch, and in version `2.0.11-3.1` for Debian unstable.
*   The vulnerability is considered a grave security issue in Debian due to the potential for arbitrary file overwrite and related local denial of service.
