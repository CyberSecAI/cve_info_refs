- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from two specific HP USB Floppy Drive Keys that were potentially infected with the W32.Fakerecy or W32.SillyFDC viruses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the presence of the W32.Fakerecy and W32.SillyFDC viruses on the USB Floppy Drive Keys. These are worms that spread by copying themselves to removable and mapped drives.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a local virus infection on the systems where the infected USB drives are used. This infection could spread to mapped drives as well.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the usage of the infected HP USB Floppy Drive Keys on vulnerable systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable systems and the ability to use the infected USB Floppy Drive Keys. The attacker would likely be the distributor of the USB Keys.
