Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0092

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The phpWebSite CMS fails to properly escape user input before using it to generate links on the search result page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the search results. This is a classic vulnerability leading to XSS.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user in the search results, making it a non-persistent or reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the search results page.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
*   The impact is categorized as partial integrity impact, meaning that data can be modified within the context of the application. There is no impact to confidentiality (no information exposure) or availability (no denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to click on a malicious link containing the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof of concept URL is:
`http://phpwebsite.example.com/index.php?module=search&user=search&search=%22%3E%3Ch1%3EXSS%3C%2Fh1%3E&alternate=local&mod_title=all&submit=Search`

*   The vulnerable parameter is the `search` parameter.
*   The payload is `%22%3E%3Ch1%3EXSS%3C%2Fh1%3E`, which translates to `"><h1 >XSS</h1>`
*   This payload injects an HTML heading tag onto the page, demonstrating the capability to inject arbitrary HTML. A more malicious javascript payload could be substituted for the test payload.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered on December 29, 2007, and the vendor was notified the same day.
* The vendor reportedly fixed the vulnerability by December 31, 2007.
* The vulnerability affects phpWebSite version 1.4.0
* CVSS score was 4.3
