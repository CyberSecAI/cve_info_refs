  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that the VBScript and JScript scripting engines decode scripts in Web pages to allow the scripts to load into memory in order to run.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the VBScript and JScript scripting engines decode script in Web pages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the Web site. This could also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker could also attempt to exploit this via email by sending a specially crafted HTML email.  In all cases, an attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious content.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host malicious web content or send a malicious HTML email and convince the victim to interact with it. "
