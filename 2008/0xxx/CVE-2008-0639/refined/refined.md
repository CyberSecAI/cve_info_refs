**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability in the `EnumPrinters` function.
- The vulnerability is located in a DLL handling RPC requests.
- A patch bypass is possible due to the logical flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
- The code executes within the context of the `SYSTEM` user, meaning the attacker gains the highest level of privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via RPC requests.
