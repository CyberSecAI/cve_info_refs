  "CVE-2008-0250": {
    "description": "Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 SP6 has a local buffer overflow vulnerability. By crafting a malicious .sln file, an attacker can overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code when the file is opened by the vulnerable application.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow occurs when parsing a specially crafted .sln file due to insufficient bounds checking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Lack of Input Validation"
      ],
     "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Visual InterDev.",
     "attack_vector": "Local. The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious .sln file in Visual InterDev.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted .sln file, and must have access to the local system. User interaction (opening the malicious file) is required."
    },
    "exploit_details": {
      "exploit_code": "The provided Python script generates a malicious .sln file that triggers a buffer overflow when opened in Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 SP6. The exploit includes padding ('A' characters), addresses to bypass exception handlers using jumps in user32.dll, a NOP sled, and shellcode designed to execute calc.exe.",
