Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0364

**Vulnerable Software:**
*   BitTorrent 6.0 and earlier
*   uTorrent 1.7.5 and earlier, and 1.8-alpha-7834 and earlier in the 1.8.x series

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a **unicode static buffer overflow**. This occurs when the client software copies the software version strings of connected peers into a static buffer for display in the "Peers" section of the "Detailed Info" window. The `wcscpy` function is used for this operation. If the received version string is longer than the buffer's capacity, it causes a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** The core vulnerability is an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. Specifically, the application fails to check the length of the client version string before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.
*   **Use of `wcscpy`:**  The use of `wcscpy` without proper bounds checking is a direct cause of the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash of the application. The overflow can lead to an immediate crash or a crash later when switching between torrents or leaving the "Peers" window.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While initially reported as a DoS, further testing by Secunia revealed that code execution was possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely by connecting to a vulnerable client.
*   **Malicious Peer Connection:** An attacker creates a malicious peer and connects to the victim's BitTorrent/uTorrent client.
*   **Long Unicode String:** The attacker sends an excessively long unicode string as the client version identifier.
*   **Publicly Available Parameters:** The required parameters to execute the exploit (client IP, port, torrent's SHA1 hash) are publicly available on the torrent tracker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the victim's client via the random port opened by the BitTorrent/uTorrent client.
*   **Tracker Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know which torrent the target is currently using.
*   **Malicious Peer Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious peer that can send the crafted unicode string.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Windows versions of the software.  Mac and Linux versions have not been tested.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Luigi Auriemma.
*   uTorrent 1.7.6 (build 7859) was released the same day the vulnerability was reported to fix the issue.
*   BitTorrent 6.0.1 was also released to address the vulnerability.

This content provides more details than the official CVE description, including the specific function (`wcscpy`), the affected area of the application (the "Peers" section), and the remote exploitation vector by connecting as a malicious peer. It also clarifies that code execution is possible, which was not initially stated in the public reports.
