Applications: BitTorrent and uTorrent
http://www.bittorrent.com
http://www.utorrent.com
Versions: BitTorrent <= 6.0 (build 5535)
uTorrent <= 1.7.5 (build 4602)
uTorrent <= 1.8-alpha-7834
uTorrent 1.6.x NOT vulnerable
Platforms: Windows confirmed
Mac and Linux (both available only on BitTorrent) have
not been tested
Bug: unicode static buffer-overflow
Exploitation: remote

4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
BitTorrent and uTorrent are the most used clients for the bittorrent
protocol and are both built over the same code base derived by
uTorrent.
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
By default both the clients have the "Detailed Info" window active with
the "General" section visible in it where are reported various
informations about the status of the torrent and the trackers in use.
In this same window near "General" there is also the "Peers" section
which is very useful since it showes many informations about the other
connected clients like the percentage of availability of the shared
torrent, their IP address, country, speed and amount of downloaded and
uploaded data and moreover the version of their client (like
"BitTorrent 6.0", "Azureus 3.0.3.4", "uTorrent 1.7.5", "KTorrent 2.2.4"
and so on).
When this window is visualized by the user the unicode strings with the
software versions of the connected clients are copied in the relative
static buffers used for the visualization in the GUI through the
wcscpy function.
If this string is too long a crash will occur immediately or in some
cases (like on BitTorrent) could happen later or when the user watches
the status of another torrent or leaves the "Peers" window.
UPDATE 25 Jan 2008
Secunia has performed additional tests on the vulnerability and has
found that code execution is possible.
For exploiting the problem is enough that an external attacker connects
to the random port opened on the client and sends the long client
version and the SHA1 hash of the torrent currently in use and watched
on the target.
Note that all these parameters (client IP, port and torrent's hash) are
publicly available on the tracker.

4) Fix

uTorrent 1.7.6 (build 7859) released the same day I reported the
vulnerability, great job!
UPDATE 25 Jan 2008
BitTorrent 6.0.1 released

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
