Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0328

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `page.php` script in FaScript FaName v1 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The script does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
*  The script also stores sensitive admin credentials in a publicly accessible file (`./admin/pconfig.php`) that can be accessed via the SQL injection vulnerability, if `load_file()` function is enabled in MySQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can read sensitive information, such as admin usernames and passwords, stored in the database or other files on the server through `load_file()` function.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker can modify or delete arbitrary data in the database.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious SQL query and inserting it into the `id` parameter of the `page.php` URL.  For example: `http://Sitename/faname/page.php?id=<SqL Code>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the target system. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a standard web browser.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit specifically targets `pconfig.php`, aiming to leak administrator credentials. The file path (`./admin/pconfig.php`) is also provided in hexadecimal format (0x2e2f61646d696e2f70636f6e6669672e706870).
*  The exploit utilizes the `load_file()` MySQL function, along with a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the contents of `pconfig.php` through SQL injection.
*   The provided exploit code uses `999999'%20union/**/select/**/0,load_file(0x2e2f61646d696e2f70636f6e6669672e706870),2,3/**/from/**/mysql.user/*`.
