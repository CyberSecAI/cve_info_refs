Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `aid` parameter of the `com_xfaq` Joomla component.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `aid` parameter when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, by injecting SQL commands.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL targeting the vulnerable component. The vulnerable URL structure is: `index.php?option=com_xfaq&task=answer&Itemid=[...]&catid=[...]&aid=[SQL Injection Payload]`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application and inject SQL code. No special privileges are required.

The exploit string provided in the content is:
```
index.php?option=com_xfaq&task=answer&Itemid=S@BUN&catid=97&aid=-9988%2F%2A%2A%2Funion%2F%2A%2A%2Fselect/**/concat(username,0x3a,password),0x3a,password,0x3a,username,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0/**/from/**/jos_users/*
```
This URL attempts to use a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
