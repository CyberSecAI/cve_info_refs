Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0519

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `com_jokes` component of Mambo, a content management system. The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cat` parameter when handling category views, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize the `cat` parameter, allowing for SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** By injecting malicious SQL queries, an attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database. In this specific case, the exploit shows how to retrieve usernames and passwords from the `mos_users` table.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also manipulate or delete data within the database
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**: The attacker could potentially gain control of the application and/or the underlying server

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request. The vulnerable parameter is passed as part of the URL.
- **Specifically crafted URL**: The exploit uses `index.php?option=com_jokes&Itemid=S@BUN&func=CatView&cat=-776655/**/union/**/select/**/0,1,2,3,username,5,password,7,8/**/from/**/mos_users/*`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to have access to the web application through a network connection.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know that the `com_jokes` component is installed and vulnerable.
- **Understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the database.
- The component is identified as "jokes" version 1.0, indicating a potential for a wide range of vulnerable instances
- The exploit was published on January 30th, 2008.

This exploit was tested on a Mambo installation running the vulnerable jokes component.
