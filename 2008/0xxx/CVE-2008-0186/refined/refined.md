Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities in NetRisk 1.9.7

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `pid` parameter of the `profile` page, allowing attackers to inject SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper output encoding or sanitization when handling the `page` parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-provided input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-provided input back to the user's browser without proper encoding, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database (such as usernames and passwords), modify data, or potentially gain full control of the database server. The example shows how to extract the admin's login name and password.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities. The example shows how to execute an alert that displays the user's cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is the `pid` parameter within the `index.php?page=profile` URL.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attack vector is the `page` parameter in the `index.php` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NetRisk application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit these vulnerabilities.
* The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `pid` and `page` URL parameters.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided information mentions that NetRisk 1.9.7 has other SQL injection, XSS, and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in other pages as well.
*  This content provides more details than the official CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerable parameters and providing examples of how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
