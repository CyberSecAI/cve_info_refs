F5 BIG-IP Web Management List Search XSS
Product: F5 BIG-IP
http://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/
The F5 BIG-IP web management interface contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Search function present on several list-like pages. Parameter SearchString is not sanitized before it gets embedded in the HTML output. The following pages have been found vulnerable:
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/virtual\_server/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/http/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/ftp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/rtsp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/sip/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/persistence/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/fastl4/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/fasthttp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/httpclass/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/tcp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/udp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/sctp/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/clientssl/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/serverssl/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/authn/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/connpool/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/statistics/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/profile/stream/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/pool/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/node/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/monitor/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/locallb/ssl\_certificate/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/user/list.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/log/list\_system.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/log/list\_pktfilter.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/log/list\_ltm.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/log/resources\_audit.jsp
/tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/log/list\_asm.jsp
Example:
https://(target\_page)?SearchString=%22%20type=%22hidden%22%3E%3Cscript%3
Ealert(%22list-xss%22)%3C/script%3E%3Cinput%20type=%22hidden%22%20value=
%22
The vulnerability has been identified in version 9.4.3. However, other versions may be also affected.
Solution:
Administrators should not browse untrusted sites while logged into the BIG-IP web management interface. It is not possible to log out of the interface so it is important to shut down the browser after the interface is no longer needed. Closing the interface browser window or removing the BIG-IP cookie is not sufficient.
History:
1/3/08 - F5 notified via e-mail
1/3/08 - Automated receipt from F5
1/14/08 - Public disclosure
