  "CVE-2008-0063": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Uninitialized stack values are used in the generation of error messages within the Kerberos 4 support of the KDC (Key Distribution Center)",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized stack memory",
        "Information Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from the server's memory, which may include key data or other sensitive information in error messages returned by the KDC.  The severity of the issue is rated as medium, as an exploit might not be consistently successful and might not always expose key information.",
       "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted or truncated Kerberos 4 message to a Kerberos 5 KDC where krb4 support is enabled.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to a server running the KDC that has Kerberos 4 support enabled.  No authentication is required."
