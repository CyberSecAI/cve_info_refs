Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2008-0082:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by an ActiveX control, `Messenger.UIAutomation.1`, within Windows Messenger that is incorrectly marked as safe for scripting. This allows unauthorized access to its functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted Scripting:** The ActiveX control `Messenger.UIAutomation.1` can be scripted by unauthorized applications or web pages, which is not intended.
- **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerable scripting of the ActiveX control allows retrieval of user data and potentially allows unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could:
    - Obtain contact information of the logged-on user.
    - Capture the user's logon ID.
    - Remotely log on to the user's Messenger client impersonating that user.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could:
    - Change the user's Messenger state.
    - Initiate audio and video chat sessions without the user's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:**
    - An attacker hosts a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The attacker convinces the user to visit this page, typically via a link in an email or instant message.
    - Compromised websites, or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, could also host the malicious code.
- **ActiveX Control Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting the ability to script the `Messenger.UIAutomation.1` ActiveX control through a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage, or inject the malicious script into a compromised website.
- The attacker must convince a user with a vulnerable version of Windows Messenger to visit the webpage while logged into Messenger.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows XP and Windows 2000 and "Moderate" for Windows Server 2003.
- The vulnerability affects Windows Messenger versions 4.7 and 5.1.
- The patch addresses the vulnerability by locking the ActiveX control so that only authorized applications have access.
- Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003 provides some mitigation by setting the Internet zone security level to High.
- Several workarounds are identified, such as disabling or prompting for Active Scripting, setting the kill bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control, or increasing the security level of the internet zone in IE.
