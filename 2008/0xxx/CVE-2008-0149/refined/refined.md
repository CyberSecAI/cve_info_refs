  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2008-0149",
      "root_cause": "The TUTOS application allows remote command execution via the 'cmd.php' script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The 'cmd.php' script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.",
         "Lack of access control to the 'cmd.php' script, as no administrative permissions are required to access it."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with the 'cmd' parameter to the 'cmd.php' script.",
        "Direct access to the 'cmd.php' script, entering the command in the form field."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send HTTP requests. No prior authentication or authorization is needed to exploit the command execution vulnerability."
