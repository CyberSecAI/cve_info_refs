{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BitDefender Update Server's HTTP daemon is vulnerable to directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the user running the http.exe process (localsystem). This includes sensitive files such as Windows configuration files and password files.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the update server containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `GET /../../boot.ini HTTP/1.0`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the port the BitDefender Update Server is listening on. No authentication is required."
