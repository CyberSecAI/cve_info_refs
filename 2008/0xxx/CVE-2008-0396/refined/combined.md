BitDefender Update Server - Unauthorized Remote File Access Vulnerability
====================================================
\* Affected Products:
- BitDefender Security for Fileservers
- BitDefender Enterprise Manager (BDEM)
- All BitDefender Products, using their internal update server product
\* Discovered by: Oliver Karow
http://oliver.greyhat.de/2008/01/19/bitdefender-unauthorized-remote-file
-access-vulnerability/
\* Vulnerable platform: Windows
\* Vulnerable Version: N/A
Product/Company-Information:
=====================
- From Bitdefender's web site:
"BitDefenderT provides security solutions to satisfy the protection requirements of today's computing environment, delivering effective threat management for over 41 million home and corporate users in more than 100 countries. BitDefender, a division of SOFTWIN, is headquartered in Bucharest, Romania and has offices in Tettnang, Germany, Barcelona, Spain and Fort Lauderdale (FL), USA.
.....The Update Server allows you to set up an upgrade location within your local network. This way you needn't worry about updating the products installed on computers that are not connected to the Internet, achieving, at the same time, faster updates and reduced
Internet traffic. The BitDefender Update Server is easy to configure through an intuitive step by step wizard. It will help you get the latest updates for all BitDefender products."
Vulnerability / Exploit
===============
The Update Server, which is part of several of BitDefender's Enterprise products, is running an Http-Daemon. The http.exe process is running with localsystem privileges and is vulnerable to the plain old directory traversal vulnerability. Thus it is possible to access files outside of the applications root directory with the named privileges.
To exploit simply do an
echo -e "GET /../../boot.ini HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc <server> <port>
or use your webbrowser :)

### [BitDefender – Unauthorized Remote File Access Vulnerability](http://oliver.greyhat.de/2008/01/19/bitdefender-unauthorized-remote-file-access-vulnerability/)

Filed under: [Advisories](http://oliver.greyhat.de/category/advisories/),[linkedin](http://oliver.greyhat.de/category/linkedin/) — oliver.karow @ 13:31

Today I published an advisory for the BitDefender Update Server. BitDefender is one of the larger vendors for Antivirus software.

The update servers function is to deliver new Antivirus patterns and engine updates to the software clients. Therefore it is using the http protocol and a http daemon. The daemon does not require authentication and is vulnerable to the oldest vulnerability known for webservers: The directory traversal attack.

This means everyone who is able to connect to the port of the Update Server with his webbrowser, is able to read all files on the server (at least on the same partition/drive), including Windows configuration files, password files etc., etc.

It also seems, that BitDefender does not have a dedicated response team, responsible for vulnerabilities within their own products. The mail I send to them, in order to inform them about their vulnerability was responded by an automated mail, requesting me to register on their website in order to access their support material…… sorry guys, i dont have time for such games…. please learn how other AV- and Softwarevendors are handling this!!!

You can find the original advisory [here](http://www.oliverkarow.de/research/bitdefender.txt).

More of my humble advisories can be found on my [website](http://www.oliverkarow.de/Research.htm)….

   Muss das erstmal hochladen… bin nicht so gut am computer, daher dauert das etwas länger.

   Aber die Zusammenfassung ist die: Lade dir irgendeine Enterprise Software von Bitdefender runter, installiere Sie, aktiviere den Update Server und mache dann ein: echo -e „GET /../../boot.ini HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n“ | nc host port

   PS: Ich versuche mal im laufe des WE das advisory hochzuladen!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
