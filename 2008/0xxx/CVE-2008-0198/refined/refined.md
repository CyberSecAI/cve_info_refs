Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in WP-ContactForm:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the WP-ContactForm plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly encode or escape data entered into several fields before rendering them in HTML, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent XSS:** Multiple instances of persistent XSS vulnerabilities exist in the WP-ContactForm plugin. The vulnerabilities are located in the plugin options page as well as on the contact form page itself.
*   **Insufficient Anti-automation:** Older versions of the plugin also lack captcha which allows for Insufficient Anti-automation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute when an administrator views the plugin's options page. This can lead to session hijacking, arbitrary actions performed on behalf of the admin, or complete site takeover.
*   **User Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user views the contact form page. This can lead to a variety of attacks including but not limited to redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing user's session data, and defacing the website.
*   **CSRF + XSS:** In some cases, the XSS vulnerabilities can be combined with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Requests:** The attack vectors involve crafting malicious POST requests to the plugin's options page (`http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-contact-form/options-contactform.php`) which can be made via the website itself or through external means.
*   **Vulnerable Fields:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through multiple fields, including:
    *   `wpcf_email`
    *   `wpcf_subject`
    *   `wpcf_question`
    *   `wpcf_answer`
    *   `wpcf_success_msg`
    *   `wpcf_error_msg`
    *  E-mail Address, Subject, Success Message, Error Message fields in version 1.5 alpha.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft POST requests and insert malicious JavaScript code.
*  **No Authentication Required** An attacker does not need prior authentication to craft a malicious post request against the vulnerable plugin.
*  **User Interaction Required** To exploit the user facing XSS, a user would need to visit the contact page or click a malicious link.

**Specific Exploits (examples from the content):**

*   `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` in `Success Message` or `Error Message` fields to attack users.
*   `</textarea><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` in `Success Message` or `Error Message` fields for attacks against both users and admins
*   `"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` in `E-mail Address`, `Subject` fields for attacks against admins.
