  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2008-0675",
      "description": "The Everything Development System Pre-1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize the 'node_id' request variable before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the 'node_id' request variable before using it in a SQL query.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection"
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can modify SELECT queries, leading to information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), or privilege escalation. Additionally, passwords are stored in plaintext, making user accounts easily compromised.",
      "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious URL with a SQL injection payload in the 'node_id' parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database query.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
