Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2008-0429

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `catid` parameter of the `forum_catview` menu, which is used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `catid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator and user credentials, as the passwords are stored in plain text.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining admin credentials, an attacker could gain complete control over the forum.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `catid` parameter of a GET request to the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge about SQL syntax and basic web application vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `index.php` file when the `menu` parameter is set to `forum_catview`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `catid`.
- The exploit uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract data from the `admin` and `users` tables by crafting a malicious `catid` value.
- Example Exploits (from exploit-db.com):
    - `www.site.com/index.php?menu=forum_catview&catid=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,5,concat(auser,0x3a,apass),7/**/FROM/**/admin/*`
    - `www.site.com/index.php?menu=forum_catview&catid=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,5,concat(username,0x3a,uemail,0x3a,upass),7/**/FROM/**/users/*`

**Additional Notes:**
- Passwords are stored in plaintext, exacerbating the impact of the vulnerability.
- The admin login page is typically located at `/admin/`.
- Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability and provide identical attack vectors.
- Exploit-DB also lists CVE-2008-0440, which appears to be a similar or related vulnerability in the same application.
