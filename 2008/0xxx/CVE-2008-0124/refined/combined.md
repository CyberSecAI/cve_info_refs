How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Serendipity 1.3-beta1 released – Serendipity

Not mainstream since 2002

## [Serendipity 1.3-beta1 released](/archives/191-Serendipity-1.3-beta1-released.html)

Serendipity 1.3-beta1 has been released. This beta is considered a release candidate before the final 1.3 release, which is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.

The new release is mainly a feature consolidation release:

* The karma rating plugin has been upgraded to support nice, CSS-based rating graphics and an overall rehaul on the its coding.
* Make the Spartacus plugin be able to use FTP upload, a workaround for SafeMode PHP restrictions. Also add a remote backend for plugin update checks.
* An importer for phpNuke and lifetype has been added.
* Support for pingbacks has been improved a lot. Trackbacks can now be blocked based on Sender IP checks.
* Add better CSS styling for some internal plugins and the embedding of images. Also made the Remote-RSS plugin to be capable of Smarty-Templating.
* Increased Smarty templating features for the {serendipity\_fetchPrintEntries} function, to be able to check for entry properties.
* Add support for SQRelay.

The full list of 35 changes to this release are documented within the **NEWS** file.

Regarding Security, the bundled Smarty library has been updated to version 2.6.19 and adresses an issue in environments where the PHP security mode is required. Also, the new Serendipity release contains tighter backend XSS checks so that environments with untrusted authors can be more secure - many thanks to Hanno Böck for addressing this.

Please test this release and give us feedback here or on the forums so that we can further improve this upcoming version. The files are available on the s9y.org [Downloads](http://www.s9y.org/12.html) page. Upgrade pointers can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.s9y.org/11.html) and is as easy as just to upload the new files.

#### Backend Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Serendipity (S9Y) 1.2.1, CVE-2008-0124

##### References

##### Description

Serendipity (S9Y) is a popular blogging system.

If used in a multiuser environment, one user can inject javascript code into certain fields in the backend
to steal the cookies and hijack the accounts of other users.

Serendipity has the trustxss plugin to prevent XSS between users on multiuser setups, but that doesn't catch
these issues.

In the »Personal Settings«-Dialogue, the »Real name« field can be filled with javascript, which appears on
newly written articles. The »Username« field can also contain javascript, but there's no attack vector, as this
field is only shown to the user itself.

Beside, the media library accepts uploads from any file format, including htm, html and js, which obviously also
leads to xss.

##### Workaround/Fix

If you have a multiuser-blog and don't trust all users, you need to install the trustxss plugin and should
immediately upgrade to 1.3-beta1.

If you're using a single-user blog, you are not affected.

##### Disclosure Timeline

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1528-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
March 24, 2008                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : serendipity
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-6205 CVE-2008-0124
BugTraq ID     : 28298
Debian Bug     : 469667

Peter HÃ¼we and Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that Serendipity, a weblog manager,
did not properly sanitise input to several scripts which allowed for
cross site scripting.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.4-1+etch1.

The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain a serendipity package.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your serendipity package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Serendipity 1.3-beta1 released – Serendipity

Not mainstream since 2002

## [Serendipity 1.3-beta1 released](/archives/191-Serendipity-1.3-beta1-released.html)

Serendipity 1.3-beta1 has been released. This beta is considered a release candidate before the final 1.3 release, which is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.

The new release is mainly a feature consolidation release:

* The karma rating plugin has been upgraded to support nice, CSS-based rating graphics and an overall rehaul on the its coding.
* Make the Spartacus plugin be able to use FTP upload, a workaround for SafeMode PHP restrictions. Also add a remote backend for plugin update checks.
* An importer for phpNuke and lifetype has been added.
* Support for pingbacks has been improved a lot. Trackbacks can now be blocked based on Sender IP checks.
* Add better CSS styling for some internal plugins and the embedding of images. Also made the Remote-RSS plugin to be capable of Smarty-Templating.
* Increased Smarty templating features for the {serendipity\_fetchPrintEntries} function, to be able to check for entry properties.
* Add support for SQRelay.

The full list of 35 changes to this release are documented within the **NEWS** file.

Regarding Security, the bundled Smarty library has been updated to version 2.6.19 and adresses an issue in environments where the PHP security mode is required. Also, the new Serendipity release contains tighter backend XSS checks so that environments with untrusted authors can be more secure - many thanks to Hanno Böck for addressing this.

Please test this release and give us feedback here or on the forums so that we can further improve this upcoming version. The files are available on the s9y.org [Downloads](http://www.s9y.org/12.html) page. Upgrade pointers can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.s9y.org/11.html) and is as easy as just to upload the new files.
