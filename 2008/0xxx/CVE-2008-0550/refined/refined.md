**[CVE-2008-0550]**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **A] NULL pointer in Content-Length:** The server allocates memory based on the `Content-Length` header, but does not check if the `malloc` call fails, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when the program attempts to use the memory.
*   **B] Off-by-one in the HTTP request:** An off-by-one error occurs when handling HTTP requests of exactly 1328 bytes, leading to a buffer overflow when placing the null terminator.
*   **C] crash in OggHeaderParse:** An integer overflow occurs during OGG tag parsing, causing a `memcpy` with a large, potentially negative, size and leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **A] NULL pointer dereference:** Failure to check the return value of `malloc` leads to dereferencing a NULL pointer.
*   **B] Buffer overflow:** An off-by-one error during null termination leads to writing outside the allocated buffer.
*  **C] Integer overflow:** Parsing of OGG headers does not handle integer overflows, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **A] NULL pointer in Content-Length:** Denial of service due to server crash.
*   **B] Off-by-one in the HTTP request:** Potential denial of service due to server crash. The success of exploitation varies by platform.
*  **C] crash in OggHeaderParse:** Denial of service due to server crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **A] NULL pointer in Content-Length:** Sending an HTTP request with a `Content-Length` that causes malloc to fail.
*   **B] Off-by-one in the HTTP request:** Sending an HTTP request of exactly 1328 bytes.
*   **C] crash in OggHeaderParse:**  Sending a crafted OGG file after successful authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **A] NULL pointer in Content-Length:** Ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the server.
*   **B] Off-by-one in the HTTP request:** Ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the server.
*   **C] crash in OggHeaderParse:** Requires valid user credentials (username and password) to access the source mount point.
