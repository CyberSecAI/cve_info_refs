{
  "CVE-2008-0459": {
    "Description": "Liquid-Silver CMS 0.1 is vulnerable to local file inclusion. By manipulating the 'update' parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server. This vulnerability allows reading sensitive files and potentially executing malicious PHP code.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input to the 'update' parameter in the `index.php` file within the `/Script/update/` directory, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary local files.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could read sensitive files on the server, which may contain configuration information, database credentials, or other sensitive data. An attacker could also potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a file containing malicious code, if the web server is configured to execute PHP.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script, specifying the file to be included in the `update` parameter. The vulnerable URL is of the form: `/Script/update/index.php?update=[path to file]`",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required. An attacker would also need to know the location of files on the server to exploit the LFI vulnerability."
