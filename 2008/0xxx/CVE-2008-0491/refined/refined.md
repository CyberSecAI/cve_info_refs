Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2008-0491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `fim_rss.php` file of the fGallery WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The script directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['album']` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
  ```php
  $cat = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM $cats WHERE id = $_GET[album]");
  $images = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM $imgs WHERE cat = $_GET[album] AND status = 'include'");
  ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can extract sensitive data from the WordPress database, such as usernames, password hashes, and email addresses of users.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With access to user credentials, an attacker could gain administrative access to the WordPress site, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `fim_rss.php` with a specially crafted `album` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in a public-facing script and does not require any authentication.

**Exploit Example:**
The provided example demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract user information:
```
[Target.il]/[wordpress_path]//wp-content/plugins/fgallery/fim_rss.php?album=-1%20union%20select%201,concat(user_login,0x3a,user_pass,0x3a,user_email),3,4,5,6,7%20from%20wp_users--
```
This crafted URL injects a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve `user_login`, `user_pass` (password hash), and `user_email` from the `wp_users` table.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit example shows how to retrieve user information. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to perform more complex database operations.
