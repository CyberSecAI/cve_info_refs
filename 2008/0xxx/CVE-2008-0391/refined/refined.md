```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application suffers from multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities due to unsanitized user-supplied input in various PHP files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection in `inc/receivertwo.php` via the `mohit` parameter.
- Password change bypass in `functionz/usercp.php` via the `id`, `old` and `new` parameters.
- User registration bypass in `inc/elementz.php` via the `ubild` and `pa` parameters.
- Admin login SQL Injection in `admin/index.php` via the `username` and `password` POST parameters.
- User login SQL Injection via the user ID and password fields.

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials and other potentially sensitive data.
- An attacker can change user passwords, including the admin account, potentially gaining full control of the application.
- An attacker can create new user accounts and potentially gain privileged access.
- An attacker can bypass authentication and login as admin or other users by injecting SQL code.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests to `inc/receivertwo.php`, `functionz/usercp.php`, `inc/elementz.php`.
- HTTP POST request to `admin/index.php` for admin login.
- HTTP POST request for user login.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- For SQL injection in `inc/receivertwo.php`, the attacker needs to be logged in.
- No special privileges are needed otherwise.
