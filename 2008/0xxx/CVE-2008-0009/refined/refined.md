      "is_related": true,
      "details": "The vulnerability is due to an inappropriate dereference of user-supplied memory pointers in the vmsplice_to_user() kernel function within fs/splice.c. The issue was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.17. Red Hat stated that this specific CVE only affected kernel versions 2.6.22 and newer but the code was different in Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels so RHEL was not affected by this specific issue."

      "source": "isec.pl_1b0418a6_20250125_040956.html",
       "is_related": true,
      "details": "The vulnerability lies in the vmsplice_to_user() function where user-supplied memory pointers are dereferenced without proper validation using access_ok(). Specifically, the code at fs/splice.c:1378 lacks this validation. The __splice_from_pipe() function assumes these pointers are valid user memory and proceeds to dereference them with __copy_to_user_inatomic() leading to an arbitrary kernel memory write. This is further described in the following excerpt of fs/splice.c:\n\n```\nerror = get_user(base, &iov->iov_base);\n/* ... */\nif (unlikely(!base)) {\nerror = -EFAULT;\nbreak;\n}\n/* ... */\nsd.u.userptr = base;\n/* ... */\nsize = __splice_from_pipe(pipe, &sd, pipe_to_user);\n```\n\nAdditionally, the copy_from_user_mmap_sem() function copies data from user-process memory using __copy_from_user_inatomic() without validating the user-supplied pointer with access_ok(). This leads to an indirect arbitrary kernel memory read."
