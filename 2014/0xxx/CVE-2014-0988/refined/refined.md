- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. It occurs when a specially crafted HTML file, designed to parse the `AccessCode` parameter, is processed by the Advantech WebAccess application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow (CWE-119). Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer when parsing the `AccessCode` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely execute arbitrary code on the target machine or crash the WebAccess application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTML file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious HTML file, which can be hosted remotely or locally. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, but requires the user to open a crafted HTML file.
