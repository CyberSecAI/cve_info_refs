Therefore the content is relevant to the specified CVE.
   
**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that PL validator functions, designed for implicit calls during `CREATE FUNCTION`, were also accessible as normal SQL functions to users. No checks were in place to prevent calling a validator designed for one language on a function written in another, leading to potential code execution within the validator and thus privilege escalation.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      - **Lack of Privilege Checks:** PL validator functions were not properly checking the user's privileges when called explicitly.
      - **Type Confusion:** The ability to call a validator function for a different language allowed for unexpected behavior.
      - **Code Execution:** Some validators may perform some level of code execution, which, coupled with the above issues, opens a privilege escalation path.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - A successful exploit allows an authenticated database user to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining administrative or other higher-level access within the database. This could allow an attacker to bypass normal access controls and potentially view, modify, or destroy any data within the database.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
      - The primary attack vector is through direct SQL calls to the validator functions. An authenticated database user could call the validator function of a procedural language directly on a function written in another language.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - The attacker must have a valid user account within the PostgreSQL database, with the ability to issue SQL queries. No specific system-level access is required, but some knowledge of how procedural language validators are implemented would help.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions**
* From Debian Security Advisory DSA-2865-1:
  *   "The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually written in some other language was not checked for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function. Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any."
* From Debian Security Advisory DSA-2864-1:
  *   "The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually written in some other language was not checked for and could be exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function. Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to their own validator functions, if any."
* From Ubuntu USN-2120-1:
  *   "Andres Freund discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly handled validator functions. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to escalate their privileges."
* From Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2014:0469
  *  "A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's procedural languages. An authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges."
* From openSUSE Security Update openSUSE-SU-2014:0368-1:
   *   "Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator functions (CVE-2014-0061)"

**4. Additional Information:**

* The Red Hat bugzilla entry [1065220](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1065220) includes the following description: "It was found that the procedural language (PLs) validator functions could possibly be leveraged for limited code execution. An authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges."

**5. Resolution**
* The fix for the vulnerability involves adding privilege checks to the validator functions. Each validator now checks if the user has the necessary permissions before executing. This change was made in PostgreSQL versions 9.3.3, 9.2.7, 9.1.12, 9.0.16, and 8.4.20.

**6. Summary of Information Provided**
* The primary vulnerability is that any authenticated user can call procedural language validator functions which are meant to be used for validation purposes during function creation.  A user can call any validator function regardless of the language of the function, which can allow a user to bypass privilege checks leading to privilege escalation.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content accurately describes the vulnerability of CVE-2014-0061, involving a privilege escalation flaw due to improper access control for PL validator functions within PostgreSQL.
