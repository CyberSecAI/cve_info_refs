Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks within the WordPress core. Specifically, users with the "contributor" role were able to publish posts, a privilege that should be restricted to higher-level roles like "editor" or "administrator".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with lower privileges (contributor) could bypass intended restrictions and perform actions (publishing posts) that are meant for users with higher privileges. This is a type of authorization bypass.
- **Improper Access Control:** The system did not properly enforce the defined user roles and permissions when processing post save requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious contributor could publish posts without authorization, potentially bypassing editorial processes, publishing unwanted content, or disrupting the normal workflow of the website. This can lead to a loss of control over content publishing and potential defacement of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A contributor crafts a specially crafted request to save or publish a post that exploits the missing checks within WordPress. This could be via the web interface or potentially via the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a registered account with a "contributor" role within the WordPress website. This means the attacker would need to have access to the WordPress backend, though with limited privileges.
- The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerability and the specific crafted request to exploit the flaw.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for CVE-2014-0165 involves adding better checks for contributor roles when saving posts, preventing them from publishing posts. The fixes have been applied to WordPress versions 3.7.2 and 3.8.2 and above.
- The issue was discovered by edik, and the fix was implemented by the WordPress core development team, including props to dd32, kovshenin, and plocha.
