{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The cron.daily and cron.weekly scripts in OpenShift execute user gear's cron jobs. If any of these jobs take a long time to run, they can prevent subsequent cron jobs from running in a timely manner, potentially causing a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper resource management or job scheduling",
      "Long-running user cron jobs can block other scheduled tasks"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, where user cron jobs may not run in a timely manner, or not at all.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious or poorly written user cron jobs that consume excessive time"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create and execute cron jobs within the OpenShift environment."
  }
