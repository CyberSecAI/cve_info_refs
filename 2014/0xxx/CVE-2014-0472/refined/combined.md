## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on April 21, 2014

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.11,
Django 1.5.6, Django 1.6.3 and Django 1.7 beta 2 -- as part of [our
security process](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/). These
releases are now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django) and our [download page](/download/).

These releases address an unexpected code-execution issue, a caching
issue which can expose CSRF tokens and a MySQL typecasting
issue. While these issues present limited risk and may not affect all
Django users, we encourage all users to evaluate their own risk and
upgrade as soon as possible.

For more details, read on.

#### Issue: Unexpected code execution using reverse()

Django's URL handling is based on a mapping of regex patterns
(representing the URLs) to callable views, and Django's own processing
consists of matching a requested URL against those patterns to
determine the appropriate view to invoke.

Django also provides a convenience function --
django.core.urlresolvers.reverse() -- which performs this process
in the opposite direction. The reverse() function takes
information about a view and returns a URL which would invoke that
view. Use of reverse() is encouraged for application developers,
as the output of reverse() is always based on the current URL
patterns, meaning developers do not need to change other code when
making changes to URLs.

One argument signature for reverse() is to pass a dotted Python
path to the desired view. In this situation, Django will import the
module indicated by that dotted path as part of generating the
resulting URL. If such a module has import-time side effects, those
side effects will occur.

Thus it is possible for an attacker to cause unexpected code
execution, given the following conditions:

1. One or more views are present which construct a URL based on user
   input (commonly, a "next" parameter in a querystring indicating
   where to redirect upon successful completion of an action).
2. One or more modules are known to an attacker to exist on the
   server's Python import path, which perform code execution with side
   effects on importing.

To remedy this, reverse() will now only accept and import dotted
paths based on the view-containing modules listed in the project's URL
pattern configuration, so as to ensure that only modules the developer
intended to be imported in this fashion can or will be imported.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0472.

Thanks to Benjamin Bach for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: Caching of anonymous pages could reveal CSRF token

Django includes both a caching framework and a system for preventing
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The CSRF-protection system
is based on a random nonce sent to the client in a cookie which must
be sent by the client on future requests and, in forms, a hidden value
which must be submitted back with the form.

The caching framework includes an option to cache responses to
anonymous (i.e., unauthenticated) clients.

When the first anonymous request to a given page is by a client which
did not have a CSRF cookie, the cache framework will also cache the
CSRF cookie and serve the same nonce to other anonymous clients who
do not have a CSRF cookie. This can allow an attacker to obtain a
valid CSRF cookie value and perform attacks which bypass the check for
the cookie.

To remedy this, the caching framework will no longer cache such
responses. The heuristic for this will be:

1. If the incoming request did not submit any cookies, and
2. If the response did send one or more cookies, and
3. If the Vary: Cookie header is set on the response, then the
   response will not be cached.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0473.

Thanks to committer Paul McMillan for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: MySQL typecasting

The MySQL database is known to "typecast" on certain queries; for
example, when querying a table which contains string values, but using
a query which filters based on an integer value, MySQL will first
silently coerce the strings to integers, and return a result based on
that.

If a query is performed without first converting values to the
appropriate type, this can produce unexpected results, similar to what
would occur if the query itself had been manipulated.

Django's model field classes are aware of their own types and most
such classes perform explicit conversion of query arguments to the
correct database-level type before querying. However, three model
field classes did not correctly convert their arguments:

* FilePathField
* GenericIPAddressField
* IPAddressField

These three fields have been updated to convert their arguments to the
correct types before querying.

Additionally, developers of custom model fields are now warned via
documentation to ensure their custom field classes will perform
appropriate type conversions, and users of the raw() and
extra() query methods -- which allow the developer to supply raw
SQL or SQL fragments -- will be advised to ensure they perform
appropriate manual type conversions prior to executing queries.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0474.

Thanks to the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski,
for providing information regarding this issue.

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import and
execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2014-0472)

It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django
application. (CVE-2014-0473)

It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not properly
perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when processed by a
Django application using a MySQL database, could have various
application-specific impacts on the MySQL database. (CVE-2014-0474)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Benjamin Bach as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0472, Paul McMillan as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0473, and
the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski, as the original
reporters of CVE-2014-0474.

All users of OpenStack Dashboard are advised to upgrade to these updated

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0472 CVE-2014-0473 CVE-2014-0474 CVE-2014-1418
                 CVE-2014-3730

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0472

    Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.

CVE-2014-0473

    Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.

CVE-2014-0474

    Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.

CVE-2014-1418

    Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
    private data or poison caches.

CVE-2014-3730

    Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
    use this to cause unexpected redirects.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

# USN-2169-1: Django vulnerabilities

22 April 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted Python

paths when using the reverse() function. An attacker could use this issue

to cause Django to import arbitrary modules from the Python path, resulting

in possible code execution. ([CVE-2014-0472](/security/CVE-2014-0472))

Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain pages that

contained CSRF cookies. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain

a valid cookie and perform attacks which bypass the CSRF restrictions.

([CVE-2014-0473](/security/CVE-2014-0473))

Michael Koziarski discovered that Django did not always perform explicit

conversion of certain fields when using a MySQL database. An attacker

could possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. ([CVE-2014-0474](/security/CVE-2014-0474))

## Synopsis

Moderate: Django security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0457)

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import and
execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2014-0472)

It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django
application. (CVE-2014-0473)

It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not properly
perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when processed by a
Django application using a MySQL database, could have various
application-specific impacts on the MySQL database. (CVE-2014-0474)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Benjamin Bach as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0472, Paul McMillan as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0473, and
the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski, as the original
reporters of CVE-2014-0474.

All users of OpenStack Dashboard are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for
the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
