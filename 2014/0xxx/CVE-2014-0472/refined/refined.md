{
  "CVE-2014-0472": {
    "Description": "The django.core.urlresolvers.reverse function in Django before 1.4.11, 1.5.x before 1.5.6, 1.6.x before 1.6.3, and 1.7.x before 1.7 beta 2 allows remote attackers to import and execute arbitrary Python modules by leveraging a view that constructs URLs using user input and a \"dotted Python path.\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `reverse()` function in Django's URL handling could import modules specified by a dotted python path from user input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unexpected code execution",
      "Unvalidated user input"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers could import and execute arbitrary Python modules on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted URL",
      "User-provided input"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to submit a request to a Django application using a specially crafted view that uses user-controlled input to build the URL using reverse()."
