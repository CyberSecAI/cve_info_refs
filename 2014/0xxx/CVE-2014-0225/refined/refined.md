- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spring Framework, when processing user-provided XML documents, did not disable the resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform an XXE attack. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution in some cases.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted XML document containing a malicious DTD declaration, an attacker can force the server to resolve external entities, which can then be used to read local files, trigger network connections, or cause other malicious actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide XML documents to the vulnerable Spring application. This could be through a web service endpoint, a file upload functionality, or any other mechanism that processes XML input.
