How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Summary

Upgrade Commons FileUpload to version 1.3.1 (avoids DoS attacks) and adds 'class' to exclude params in ParametersInterceptor (avoid ClassLoader manipulation)

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | DoS attacks and ClassLoader manipulation |
| Maximum security rating | Important |
| Recommendation | Developers should immediately upgrade to [Struts 2.3.16.2](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts23161) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.16.1 |
| Reporter | Peter Magnusson (peter.magnusson at omegapoint.se), Przemysław Celej (p-celej at o2.pl) |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2014-0050 (DoS), CVE-2014-0094 (ClassLoader manipulation) |

## Problem

The default upload mechanism in Apache Struts 2 is based on Commons FileUpload version 1.3 which is vulnerable and allows DoS attacks. Additional ParametersInterceptor allows access to 'class' parameter which is directly mapped to getClass() method and allows ClassLoader manipulation.

## Solution

In Struts 2.3.16.1, Commons FileUpload was updated to version 1.3.1 and "class" was added to excludeParams in struts-default.xml configuration of ParametersInterceptor.

## Backward compatibility

No backward compatibility problems are expected.

## Workaround

If you cannot upgrade to version 2.3.16.2 which is strongly advised, you can apply below workarounds:

### Upgrade commons-fileupload

The fixed commons-fileupload library is a drop-in replacement for the vulnerable version. Deployed applications can be hardened by replacing the commons-fileupload jar file in WEB-INF/lib with the updated jar. For Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>commons-fileupload</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-fileupload</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```
### Exclude 'class' parameter

Simple add '^class\.\*' to the list of excludeParams as below

```
<interceptor-ref name="params">
  <param name="excludeParams">^class\..*,^dojo\..*,^struts\..*,^session\..*,^request\..*,^application\..*,^servlet(Request|Response)\..*,^parameters\..*,^action:.*,^method:.*</param>
</interceptor-ref>
```

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](https:///security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 98 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/)

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF.](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF)

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PIN) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories.](https:///security-alerts/) An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a CVE# which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html)  Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html)

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https:///security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967243.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967243.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy.](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1. Please review the](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy.](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 4 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 3 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](https:///security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the  [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Oracle Fusion Middleware](#AppendixFMW) sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2015), [My Oracle Support Note 1986100.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1986100.1)

The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](https:///security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html#JAVA)

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2014.04.25 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |

# Ver 7.3.0.0 – What’s New?

### Introduction

Version 7.3.0.0 is the first release after version 7.2.0.2 that has been made generally available. It contains many exciting new features and a number of bug fixes. Before upgrading, please read the Upgrade Compatibility Alerts for each version.

### Version 7.3.0.0

Note that some of the features highlighted below are only available in the Enterprise Extensions. See [here](http://www.konakart.com/product/community-or-enterprise) for full details of what is included only in the Enterprise Extensions.

### New Features

* The storefront now uses a responsive design to optimally adapt to mobile devices with different screen resolutions.
* Now possible to define the order of the sections in the Admin Application using File-Based Configuration
* Options for defining Admin user password validity and expiry period.
* Generated passwords now have a mixture of lower case, upper case, numeric and special characters
* When creating a new customer in the Administration Application the chosen password must now conform to the password validity rules defined for the site.
* Current password is now required to modify the email address using the storefront application.
* Now possible to assign the same admin role to the same user in different stores. Previously it was necessary to have separate roles per store to define this.
* Upgraded to ANT 1.9.3
* Upgraded to GWT 2.6.0
* Added the option to add “Other” gender in addition to Male and Female. Default is to show just Male and Female but you can set the ENABLE\_OTHER\_GENDER configuration parameter in the Admin Application if you wish to enable “Other” gender.
* Added validation support to droplist and radio button template based custom product attributes. Allows you to default to an invalid value in order to force a selection.
* Added Authorize Direct Post Method (DPM) to simplify PCI compliance. When using this payment method, the credit card details never enter your servers.
* Added Authorize Payment Tokenization (CIM) to simplify PCI compliance. CIM allows a customer to store and manage his credit cards without these cards ever entering your servers. During checkout a customer may decide to pay using a stored card (CIM) or by entering card details using the Direct Post Method (DPM).
* Added new attributes to the customer object to store various tax-related attributes and reference ids used to look up the customer in external systems.
* Added Paymetric Payment Gateway
* Added Thomson Reuters Tax Order Total Module
* Log into the Admin App by entering username and password then hitting ENTER key – no longer necessary to click on the Login button.
* Added getRMACode() method to the OrderIntegrationMgr where it can be modified to add your own algorithm for creating an RMA code. The output of this method is used to automatically populate the RMA code field in the Admin App when inserting a new Returns object.
* Added a new “User Defined” panel to the Administration Application that allows you to display custom configuration parameters. Any configuration parameters added to configuration group number 31 will appear on the User Defined panel. Enterprise Only.
* Added support for Customer.firstName, Customer.lastName, Address.firstName and Address.lastName in Custom Validation allowing the definition of the validation rules for these attributes.
* Added a new KKEng API call to validate the password of a logged in user.
* Added new KKEng API calls to retrieve coupons based on coupon code and coupon id and to retrieve the promotions associated with a coupon.
* AdminCategory objects now populated with their lastAdded attribute from getCategory calls.
* On the Customer Communications Panel of the Administration Application the “All Customers” emailing option will now either send email to all visible customers or all visible registered customers depending on whether the “Only Registered Customers” checkbox is checked.
* WSDL files (for the storefront service and the admin service) provided with meaningful parameter names (rather than in0, in1 etc).
* Upgraded to Apache Tomcat 7.0.54.
* Java 8 runtime support added. Java 6, Java 7 and Java 8 are all supported.
* Added a new Interceptor class (NoCache) to the storefront application’s Struts configuration to expire pages so that they aren’t visible by using the browser’s back button. This is a security / privacy measure.
* From the Administration Application, Manufacturer images are uploaded by default to the concatenation of the image base path (a configuration variable), the defined “manufacturer” image directory (defined in File-based configuration) and the source filename. Sample manufacturer images have been restored to the default set-up as examples.
* The deleteManufacturer KKAdminIf API call now removes the Manufacturer’s image file from disk if it exists.
* New KKAdminIf API calls – addImage and removeImage. addImage allows you to add an image to a product or a manufacturer in a standard fashion so that you can view it in the Administration Application.
* Added functionality to the Admin App to enable you to remove product prices and quantities from a catalog.
* Modified the Coupons panel in the Admin App so that after editing a coupon it remains selected.
* Enhanced the functionality for creating data entry widgets for configuring promotions. You can now define a rich text editor and add validation to the widget definitions.
* Modified the Admin API call editOrder() to include the OrderProduct custom fields.
* Modified the Admin App popup window to select categories for promotion rules. The categories are now displayed in a collapsible tree view.

### Bug fixes

* Added a new report – OrdersInLast25DaysChart to replace the OrdersInLast30DaysChart report which reported orders in the previous month inaccurately. The earlier version is retained but its use is deprecated.
* GeoZone checking for shipping and payment modules was not working correctly for GeoZones mapped to a country when that country had no defined zones.
* The payment method drop list was not being updated on changes to the billing address on the checkout screen.
* Some source files deployed under the custom directory were mistakenly placed in two directories which could have led to incorrect versions being built into jars. This has been fixed so that no duplicates are now deployed.
* The number of logons and the last logon time was not being populated on the customer object when returned using the storefront server eCommerce engine.
* When in mode that allows checkout without registration, the password entry fields would disappear after changing country when attempting to register.
* Fix to struts.xml to prevent CVE-2014-0094 vulnerability.
* Added security enhancement to the storefront application to prevent XSRF attacks. Thanks to Christian Schneider for reporting the issue.
* Modified TotalDiscount, BuyXGetYFree and ShippingDiscount to deduct tax after applying the discounts.
* The customer group was being reset by the storefront application whenever a customer updated his details.
* Certain product search-related queries were not being logged when the DB Logging flag was set to INFO. The logging of these queries have now been added. (The log4j log flag to set to log the SQL is log4j.logger.com.konakart.db = INFO).
* When returning an array of reviews, the application engine was not calculating the average review score properly whenever an offset was set in the DataDescriptor parameter.
* A Solr search no longer returns products that do not have catalog prices or quantities defined. This matches the search results when Solr isn’t enabled. Note that suggested search returns all enabled products.
* KKAppEng start-up was not looking up alternative property filenames via the customisable PropertyFileNames class.
* Fixes problem with uploading Digital Download files in the Admin App.
* Under certain conditions the Admin Application About box was reporting the wrong version number of the Admin Engine being used.
* The Admin API call getSubscriptions() was not filtering correctly when using the lastBillingDate filter.

### Backwards Compatibility Alert

* A number of classes have been moved from the konakart.jar to the konakart\_custom.jar. This has been done to make it much easier to customise these classes and re-generate the konakart\_custom.jar by using the standard ANT build in the custom directory. The classes that have been moved are:
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/ordertotal/OrderTotalInterface.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/ordertotal/OrderTotalMgr.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/others/AddrValidationInterface.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/payment/PaymentInfo.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/payment/PaymentInterface.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/payment/PaymentMgr.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/shipping/ShippingInfo.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/shipping/ShippingInterface.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/shipping/ShippingMgr.java
  + \*custom/appn/src/com/konakart/bl/modules/shipping/WeightCost.java
* Publish Products and Google Shopping functionality has been removed due to the demise of
   Google Base then Google Shopping.
* Modified the Admin API call editOrder() to include the OrderProduct custom fields.
   This change should be backwards compatible but it’s good to be aware of it.
* The mobile storefront is no longer included in the download package since the
   storefront now has a responsive design.

# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

IT Security Center

Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.
