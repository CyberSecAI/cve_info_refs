Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the information related to CVE-2014-0094:

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-0094 is a vulnerability in Apache Struts related to the `ParametersInterceptor`. It allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions by manipulating the ClassLoader of the application server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the `class` parameter.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `ParametersInterceptor` in Apache Struts, which doesn't properly restrict access to the `class` parameter.
- This oversight allows an attacker to use the `class` parameter to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incomplete fix related to `ParametersInterceptor` and lack of restriction on the `class` parameter.
- Improper access control allowing manipulation of the ClassLoader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Bypassing security restrictions.
- Potential for file disclosure or denial-of-service (DoS).
- In certain situations, remote execution of arbitrary commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based attacks exploiting HTTP requests to manipulate the class parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Remote attacker with the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication required to exploit the vulnerability in some scenarios.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Struts version 2.3.16.2 with a fix that excludes 'class' from parameters in ParametersInterceptor.
- Several vendors, including Huawei, IBM, VMware and Oracle have released security advisories and patches related to this vulnerability affecting their products that use Apache Struts.
-  The vulnerability can be mitigated by either updating to the fixed Struts version or applying workarounds such as upgrading commons-fileupload, or by excluding the 'class' parameter.

**CVSS Score:**

-  The provided sources quote a CVSS Base Score of 5 to 7.5 for CVE-2014-0094.
    - IBM : CVSS Base Score: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
    - Huawei: CVSS Base Score: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)
    - JVN: CVSS V2 Severity: Base Metrics [7.5](AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

- The differences are likely related to different scoring based on the specific product and implementation using the vulnerable Apache Struts component.
