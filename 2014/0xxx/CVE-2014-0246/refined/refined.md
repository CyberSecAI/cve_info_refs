Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `sosreport` tool, when run on a system using a GRUB bootloader password, collects and stores the MD5 hash of that password within the resulting archive of debugging information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The `sosreport` tool unintentionally captures a hashed version of a sensitive credential, the GRUB bootloader password, exposing it in the diagnostic archive.
- **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The tool lacks proper sanitization measures to prevent the collection of sensitive information like password hashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker who gains access to the `sosreport` archive could potentially obtain the GRUB bootloader password by cracking the exposed MD5 hash. This would allow them to bypass GRUB authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Unauthorized Archive Access:** An attacker would need to gain access to a system's `sosreport` archive. This could occur through various means, such as:
  - Compromising the system where the archive is stored.
  - Intercepting the archive while it is being transferred.
  - Gaining access to the archive if an authorized user shares it without reviewing the content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker must have access to the archive generated by the sosreport tool.
- The attacker would then need to possess the capability to attempt to crack the MD5 hash of the GRUB password.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Dolev Farhi of F5 Networks.
- Red Hat initially classified this as a security issue but later marked it as "NOTABUG," arguing that `sosreport` makes a best effort to scrub data, and users are responsible for reviewing the collected data before sharing it. They claim that the program cannot account for every single password in every file it collects.
- A similar issue with the collection of sensitive information in `sosreport` was previously identified and tracked as CVE-2012-2664
- A fix was pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository as sos-3.1-1.fc19.
