## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites include:**
| Version of IBM Installation Manager required: [IBM Installation Manager 1.7.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036814). |
| --- |
| Review technote [1682434: Prerequisite steps before upgrading the RLKS Administration Agents to 8.1.4.4 for RLKS redundant setup](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682434) before upgrading. |
|

IBM Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool (ART) and IBM Rational License Key Server Administration Agent **MUST BE CONFIGURED** according to the following hardware and software specifications. Otherwise failure may occur during license administration and usage reporting.

 **Additional Notes**: Upgrade the agent and ART to version 8.1.4.4 to obtain the improvements that are included in this release.  **Important**: ART cannot be upgraded to version 8.1.4.4 using the IBM Installation Manager Update option. To upgrade to version 8.1.4.4, you must uninstall the previous version of ART. After you uninstall the previous version, the data in the installation directory remains. Do not delete this directory. When you install version 8.1.4.4, the installer migrates the data from the old installation directory into the new installation directory. Ensure that you select the option to migrate data from the old installation location during the installation. See the [Upgrading](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSTWP_8.1.4/com.ibm.rational.license.doc/topics/c_upgrading_rcl.html) section of the IBM Knowledge Center.  You can use Installation Manager 1.7.2 to upgrade the agent to version 8.1.4.4.  If the 8.1.4 agent is configured with the administration and reporting tool, when you upgrade the agent to 8.1.4.4, the tool shows the reporting status as **Not Running**. When you select **Start reporting** for the first time, the log file conversion process begins. Depending on the size of your server log file, it can take time for the initial conversion of the data. The system must convert the data in the entire log to the required format. NEW: Data backup and upgrade When you upgrade from version 8.1.4.4 or later, the installer automatically creates a backup of your license usage data. However, if you prefer to create your own backup, copy this directory: RLKSAdmin/server/conf/lqe. Hardware requirementsRational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool:  * Memory: 8 GB RAM * Disk space: 100 GB  Rational License Key Server Administration Agent:  * Memory: 8 GB RAM * Disk space: 50 GB  Software requirementsWeb browser requirement for Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool:  * Mozilla Firefox: 10 ESR and future fix packs * Internet Explorer: Version 9, 10, or 11   **Important:** Switch to Standard View by clicking **Tools > Developer tools** to work with the server administration and reporting tool. Internet Explorer does not render the server administration and reporting tool properly in Compatibility View.  Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool:  * Rational License Key Server: version 8.1.2, 8.1.3, or 8.1.4   **Note:** Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool does not support Rational License Key Server 8.1.1 * Jazz team server version 4.0.1 and later * Operating systems: **ONLY 64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE SUPPORTED**  Rational License Key Server Administration Agent:  * Installation Prerequisite: The Server Administration Agent **MUST BE COLLOCATED** with the license server * Operating Systems: All operating systems supported by Rational License Key Server (version 8.1.2 and later versions) and the IBM solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management (version 4.0.1 and later versions) server. |

## How critical is this fix?

*Impact Assessment*
| Impact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Corrective** | This is a fixpack release. It contains fixes for client-reported and internally found defects. |
| [Test Results](#typeRESULT)   [Close [x]](#close)   Definitions  **Regression:** An error in the [Maintenance Delivery Vehicle](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656) (MDV) that produces incorrect or unexpected behavior causing a supported feature to stop functioning as designed. This includes:  * Coding errors that cause a regression * Documentation or packaging problems that cause a regression * Errors reported in a new function delivered in a MDV that cause a regression  **Incomplete:** An error in the MDV has not regressed, but does not work as designed. This includes:  * Fixed APARs which did not solve the original problem but did not break anything new * APARs reporting documentation errors, such as readme errors, that cause problems applying an MDV but do not lead to a regression   ---   **Notes:  * Regression and incomplete APARs are considered fix-in-error or MDV-in-error * Definitions above apply only to valid APARs that result in product fixes (APARs returned as *working-as-designed* are not assessed for being fix-in-error) * Issues in major releases due to new functionality do not apply in this definition** |

 **There are no known regressions to report.** |
