Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Rational License Key Server (RLKS) Administration and Reporting Tool's failure to set the "secure" flag for the session cookie when operating in SSL mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure session cookie handling: The absence of the "secure" flag on the session cookie means that the cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, even when the application is accessed via HTTPS (SSL).
- Sensitive information exposure: The session cookie potentially contains sensitive information related to the user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: An attacker could intercept the session cookie and gain access to sensitive information, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker positioned between the client and the server could intercept the HTTP traffic and capture the session cookie.
- Network eavesdropping: An attacker monitoring network traffic could capture the unencrypted cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
- They need to be able to conduct a MITM attack or eavesdrop on network traffic.
- They do not need to have prior access to the system or have valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in RLKS Administration and Reporting Tool versions 8.1.4, 8.1.4.2, and 8.1.4.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Rational License Key Server Fix Pack 4 (8.1.4.4) for 8.1.4.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available besides upgrading to the fixed version.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring all access is done through SSL, however the secure flag must be set to prevent leakage if HTTP is used inadvertently.
