Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0066:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from multiple sources (Red Hat Bugzilla, PostgreSQL Wiki, Ubuntu Security Notice, Red Hat Security Advisories, openSUSE mailing lists, Apple Support documents) explicitly mentions **CVE-2014-0066** with the description: **"Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL"** or equivalent. All content is therefore related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `chkpass` extension in PostgreSQL did not check the return value of the `crypt()` library function, which can return NULL upon failure (e.g. if an unsupported hashing algorithm is requested).  The extension then tries to dereference the returned NULL pointer.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of return values, specifically the lack of NULL check after calling `crypt()`. This leads to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Impact:** A crash of the PostgreSQL server due to a null pointer dereference. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Potentially more if leveraged as part of a more complex attack.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An authenticated database user can trigger the vulnerability by using the `chkpass` extension and causing the `crypt()` function to return NULL.
    *   The most common scenario in which `crypt()` would return NULL is when libc is configured to refuse to execute unapproved hashing algorithms (FIPS mode).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated database user.
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to use the `chkpass` extension

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated database user, and is not exploitable remotely without prior credentials.
*   The issue is present in PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a null check to the `chkpass` extension, preventing the dereference of a NULL pointer.
*   Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2014:0211 fixes this vulnerability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, while RHSA-2014:0249 addresses it in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. RHSA-2014:0469 fixes the vulnerability in Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.x.
*   openSUSE has released an update for openSUSE 11.4 with patch 2014-32.
*   Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2120-1 fixes this vulnerability in Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 12.10, and 13.10.
*   Apple's security update for OS X Server v3.2.1 and v4.0 included this fix for the PostgreSQL component.

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root Cause**               | The chkpass extension does not check if crypt() returns NULL before dereferencing the result.                                  |
| **Vulnerability**           | Null pointer dereference                                                                                                      |
| **Impact**                   | PostgreSQL server crash, denial-of-service                                                                                      |
| **Attack Vectors**            | Authenticated database user triggering `crypt()` to return NULL via the `chkpass` extension                                                |
| **Required Capabilities**     | Authenticated database user with ability to use `chkpass` extension.                                                  |
| **Affected Versions**         | PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later, including those shipped with various OS and applications                             |
| **Fix**                       | Added a check for NULL return value of crypt() before dereferencing it in chkpass extension.                                   |
| **Additional Notes**          | Issue mostly occurs when libc is configured in FIPS mode. Multiple OS vendors have issued patches to address this vulnerability. |
