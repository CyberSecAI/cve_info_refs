Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the KPI display name field and various portlet fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability: This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality issues: Exploitation could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, although the specific impact is not detailed beyond "confidentiality issues". The CVSS score indicates limited impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through user interaction with the affected fields. The specific method of injection is not specified, but it involves user-supplied data within the application.
- Attack occurs over the network, and requires a user to be authenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into specific fields (KPI display name or portlet fields) within the affected applications.
- The attacker must have at least some level of access to the system to modify fields or have the ability to manipulate another user into providing input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple IBM products, including Maximo Asset Management, Tivoli Asset Management for IT, Tivoli Service Request Manager, Change and Configuration Management Database, and SmartCloud Control Desk, across various versions.
- The provided IBM bulletin lists specific affected versions and provides links to fixes where available. Some fixes must be obtained by contacting IBM support.
- IBM recommends upgrading to the latest supported versions to ensure protection.
- There is a suggested temporary mitigation of limiting protocols and removing user privileges, but this approach may impact functionality.
- The issue was discovered by Jamie Riden of Pen Test Partners.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 3.5, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N, indicating a network-based attack requiring user interaction, with limited impact to confidentiality and moderate impact to integrity.
