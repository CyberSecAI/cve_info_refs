  "CVE-2014-0429": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect validation in medialib operations where mlib and raster images do not properly correspond to each other.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of image data leading to memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could trigger a Java Virtual Machine memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing of specially crafted image.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker or untrusted Java application or applet capable of processing the malicious image."
  },
  "CVE-2014-0457": {
