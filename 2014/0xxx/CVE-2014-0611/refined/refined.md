Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-0611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws within the WebAccess component of Novell GroupWise.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in GroupWise WebAccess. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's WebAccess session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's WebAccess session.
*   This could potentially lead to:
    *   Session hijacking/takeover
    *   Data theft
    *   Malicious actions performed in the name of the user
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript into WebAccess. The specific injection points or mechanisms are not detailed in this content.
*   It can be inferred that the attack requires a user to interact with the malicious content within the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code that a victim user will execute while using WebAccess.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in with valid credentials to perform the attack.
*   The attacker could potentially use social engineering or some other method of tricking the user to visit a specially crafted link that contains the malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Mario Heiderich of Cure53 and Adrian Vollmer of SySS.
*   The affected products are Novell GroupWise 2012 (up to and including SP3 HP1) and Novell GroupWise 2014 (up to and including SP1 HP1).
*   The resolution involves upgrading to GroupWise 2012 SP4 or GroupWise 2014 SP2 or later.
*   Previous, no longer supported versions of GroupWise are also likely vulnerable.
