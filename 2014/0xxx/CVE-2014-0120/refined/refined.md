Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0120:

**CVE-2014-0120:** hawtio-karaf-terminal: cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The hawtio-karaf-terminal component in the hawtio web console is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Karaf server if a user is logged into the hawt.io web console.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection in the hawtio-karaf-terminal component.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Karaf server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious web page that, when visited by a user logged into the hawt.io web console, triggers a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on social engineering to trick the victim into visiting the crafted web page.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need direct access to the server.
    *   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in user to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github commit `b4e23e002639c274a2f687ada980118512f06113` shows the patch implemented to address this vulnerability which involves using a login token. This patch adds `LoginTokenServlet` and modifies `TerminalServlet` to check for the token.
