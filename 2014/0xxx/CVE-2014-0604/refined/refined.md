Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0604:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `StartLog` method of the Attachmate Reflection Secure FTP Client ActiveX control.
*   The `StartLog` method suffers from a directory traversal flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw within the `StartLog` method. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, potentially accessing or creating files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Context of Execution:** The code is executed under the context of the user running the browser or opening the malicious file, allowing for the possibility of privilege escalation if the user has elevated permissions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker can host a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when visited by the target user.
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can deliver a malicious file that, when opened, exploits the flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker can be remote from the victim machine, exploiting the vulnerability over the network.
*   **Social Engineering:** User interaction is required to initiate the exploit, either by visiting the malicious web page or opening the malicious file.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable ActiveX control and its method.
*   **Crafting Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to craft malicious file paths within the `StartLog` method to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   Attachmate has released a patch to fix this vulnerability.
