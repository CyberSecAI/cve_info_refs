  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-0168",
    "description": "It was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Jolokia"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Jolokia agent did not properly validate the origin of incoming requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
    "impact": "A successful CSRF attack could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker crafts a malicious web page. When a user logged into Jolokia visits this page, the attacker can send unauthorized requests to the Jolokia agent.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user who is logged in to Jolokia into visiting a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker."
