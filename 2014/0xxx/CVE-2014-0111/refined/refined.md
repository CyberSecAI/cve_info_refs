Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of Apache Commons JEXL expressions in various parts of Apache Syncope, such as derived schema definitions, user/group templates, and `connObjectLinks` of resource mappings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Malicious administrators can inject arbitrary Java code within JEXL expressions. This code is then executed by the Java EE container running the Apache Syncope core, leading to remote code execution.
- **Insecure use of JEXL expressions:** Allowing administrators to use arbitrary JEXL expressions without proper sanitization or restrictions creates a significant security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where Apache Syncope is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, system manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JEXL Expression Injection:** An attacker (malicious administrator) injects malicious Java code within JEXL expressions in the following configurations:
    - Derived schema definitions
    - User/group templates
    - `connObjectLinks` of resource mappings
- **Remote Execution:** The injected code is remotely executed by the Java EE container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to access and modify the vulnerable configurations, specifically derived schema definitions, user/group templates, and resource mappings.
- **Knowledge of JEXL and Java:** The attacker needs to be familiar with JEXL syntax and be able to craft malicious Java code that can be executed in the context of the Java EE container.
