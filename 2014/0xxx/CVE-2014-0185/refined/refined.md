        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the default permissions of UNIX sockets created by PHP-FPM. Specifically, when not explicitly overridden, these sockets default to 0666 permissions, making them world-writable.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is present in the default configuration of PHP-FPM where UNIX sockets are created with 0666 permissions allowing any local user to connect to them, and in the code itself which defaults to 0666. Also example config used 0666 by default.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Any local user, or any user with the ability to connect to UNIX sockets, can connect to the PHP-FPM socket and execute arbitrary PHP code with the permissions of the target process pool (e.g., the 'www-data' user). This leads to privilege escalation.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a local user connecting to a world-writable UNIX socket used by PHP-FPM.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user or any user with the ability to connect to UNIX sockets."

      "details": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default permissions of the UNIX socket created by the PHP-FPM are insecure, defaulting to 0666 instead of a more restrictive setting.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure default permission mode (0666) for UNIX sockets created by the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) in PHP. This setting allows any local user to connect to the socket.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the FPM process user (e.g., www-data), which may lead to privilege escalation.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local user connects to the world-writable UNIX socket using a FastCGI client, and injects code to be executed by the FPM worker.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the server and the ability to connect to UNIX domain sockets."

      "details": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default permissions for UNIX sockets created by PHP-FPM were set to 0666.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The PHP-FPM default configuration and code used 0666 as the default permission for UNIX sockets, making them world-writable.  This allows any local user to connect to the socket.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could gain the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the PHP-FPM worker (e.g. www-data), leading to privilege escalation.",

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability was due to the default configuration and compiled-in defaults of PHP-FPM which resulted in UNIX sockets with world-writable (0666) permissions.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The issue stemmed from the combination of the default PHP-FPM configuration and compiled-in defaults, which resulted in a world-writable UNIX socket. This allowed any local user to connect to the socket.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with the ability to connect to UNIX sockets could execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the PHP-FPM process pool's user (e.g. www-data), allowing for local privilege escalation.",
        "Attack vectors": "Attackers exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the world-writable UNIX socket with a FastCGI client and executing arbitrary PHP code.",

            "Root cause of vulnerability": "The FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) in PHP was configured to use 0666 permissions for the UNIX socket by default.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability arises from the default file permission (0666) of the UNIX socket used by PHP-FPM, making it world-writable, and the fact that when using unix sockets the permissions default to 0666 unless overridden.",
            "Impact of exploitation": "Any local user could execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the PHP-FPM process user (e.g., www-data). This can result in local privilege escalation.",

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause lies in the insecure default permissions assigned to UNIX sockets by PHP-FPM, which were 0666, making them world-writable.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability exists due to insecure default configurations and coding within the FPM module of PHP where, by default, UNIX sockets are created with permissions allowing any user on the system to connect, and that when the 'listen.mode' variable is not explicitly set, the code defaults to using 0666. This leads to world-writable sockets.",

        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The issue lies in the default permissions (0666) set for UNIX sockets by PHP-FPM when not explicitly configured, which makes the sockets world-writable and accessible by any local user. This default behavior, combined with the lack of strict access control on the socket file itself, results in a privilege escalation vulnerability.",
