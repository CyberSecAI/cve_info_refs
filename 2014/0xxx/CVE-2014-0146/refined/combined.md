| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-20 11:59:49 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way qemu processed MAC addresses table update requests from the guest.  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt qemu process memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the qemu process.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-20 12:07:33 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does affect the qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future qemu-kvm updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:00:16 UTC  ``` Upstream patch submission:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/266713>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:01:50 UTC  ```  Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1086776](show_bug.cgi?id=1086776 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0150 xen: qemu: virtio-net: buffer overflow in virtio_net_handle_mac() function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c6)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:01:54 UTC  ```  Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1086775](show_bug.cgi?id=1086775 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0150 qemu: virtio-net: buffer overflow in virtio_net_handle_mac() function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-22 17:41:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2014:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0421.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-22 17:42:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0420 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0420.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-24 17:37:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0435 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0435.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-24 17:38:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0434 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0434.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c14)  Fedora Update System    2014-05-01 22:27:08 UTC  ``` qemu-1.6.2-4.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer
overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker
able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to
crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially
resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of
the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0143, CVE-2014-0144, CVE-2014-0145,
CVE-2014-0147)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the virtio\_net\_handle\_mac()
function of QEMU processed guest requests to update the table of MAC
addresses. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU
process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
(CVE-2014-0150)

A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the seek\_to\_sector() function of the
parallels block driver in QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image
file loaded by a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
(CVE-2014-0142)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QCOW2 block driver in
QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could
use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0146)

It was found that the block driver for Hyper-V VHDX images did not
correctly calculate BAT (Block Allocation Table) entries due to a missing
bounds check. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a
guest could use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0148)

The CVE-2014-0143 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf and Stefan Hajnoczi
of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0144 issues were discovered by Fam Zheng, Jeff
Cody, Kevin Wolf, and Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0145 issues
were discovered by Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0150 issue was
discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0142,
CVE-2014-0146, and CVE-2014-0147 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf of
Red Hat, and the CVE-2014-0148 issue was discovered by Jeff Cody of
Red Hat.

All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments
managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer
overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker
able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to
crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially
resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of
the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0143, CVE-2014-0144, CVE-2014-0145,
CVE-2014-0147)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the virtio\_net\_handle\_mac()
function of QEMU processed guest requests to update the table of MAC
addresses. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU
process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
(CVE-2014-0150)

A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the seek\_to\_sector() function of the
parallels block driver in QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image
file loaded by a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
(CVE-2014-0142)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QCOW2 block driver in
QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : qemu-kvm
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0142 CVE-2014-0143 CVE-2014-0144 CVE-2014-0145
                 CVE-2014-0146 CVE-2014-0147 CVE-2014-0222 CVE-2014-0223
                 CVE-2014-3615 CVE-2014-3640

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware:

* Various security issues have been found in the block qemu drivers.
  Malformed disk images might result in the execution of arbitrary code.
* A NULL pointer dereference in SLIRP may result in denial of service
* An information leak was discovered in the VGA emulation

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
