- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Artiva Agency Single Sign-On (SSO) feature checks only the local Windows login name and does not consider the associated user's domain name when authenticating users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication mechanism. Specifically, the application fails to validate the user's domain, relying solely on the local Windows login name.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate another Artiva Agency user by creating a local Windows user account with the same username as a legitimate user on a domain. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Artiva Agency application as the impersonated user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local to the system where the Artiva Agency application is running, where the attacker needs to create a local user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to create a local Windows user account on a system that is used to access the Artiva Agency application. The attacker needs to know a valid username within the domain used by Artiva Agency.
