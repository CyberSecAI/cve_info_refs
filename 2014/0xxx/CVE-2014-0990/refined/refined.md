The provided content is related to CVE-2014-0990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs due to the improper handling of the `UserName` parameter when parsed from a specially crafted HTML file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow (CWE-119). The Advantech WebAccess application does not properly restrict the size of the data copied into a stack buffer when parsing the `UserName` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target device or cause the WebAccess application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted HTML file. An attacker would need to convince a user to open this file. The file could be hosted on a malicious website or located on the local machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML file and convince a user of the Advantech WebAccess application to open the file. The attacker can be remote from the target system. Social engineering is required to convince the user to open the malicious HTML file.
