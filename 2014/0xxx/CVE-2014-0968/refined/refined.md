- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL that, when clicked, executes malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and have a victim click on it. This does not appear to require any special privileges beyond being able to send a URL to a victim user.
