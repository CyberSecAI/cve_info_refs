Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the interaction of Django's `RemoteUserMiddleware` and `RemoteUserBackend` when handling the `REMOTE_USER` header. If the `REMOTE_USER` header changes without a corresponding logout/login sequence, the middleware could incorrectly associate the new user with the existing session of the previous user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** The core vulnerability is the possibility of session hijacking. When the `REMOTE_USER` header changes, the existing session isn't invalidated, potentially leading to the current user inheriting the previous user's session.
*   **Inadequate Logout Mechanism:** The `RemoteUserMiddleware` did not enforce a proper logout when a new `REMOTE_USER` was detected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to another user's session and, consequently, their account.
*   **Data Exposure:** If the exploited account has sensitive information associated with it, this data would be exposed to the attacker.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the hijacked session belongs to a user with elevated privileges, the attacker could perform actions within the application with those elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REMOTE_USER Header Manipulation:** An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `REMOTE_USER` header, which is typically controlled by a reverse proxy or web server placed in front of the Django application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over the `REMOTE_USER` Header:** The attacker must have some level of control or the ability to influence the `REMOTE_USER` header. This often occurs in environments utilizing a reverse proxy that sets this header based on authentication.
*   **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs to be a user of the Django application protected by the vulnerable middleware configuration.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware that the application is using `RemoteUserMiddleware` and `RemoteUserBackend` and how to exploit the lack of session invalidation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying the middleware to force a logout and subsequent login when the `REMOTE_USER` header is changed without an explicit logout action from the user.
*   The vulnerability affects Django versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 release candidates.
