Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-0879

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A Taskmaster Web ActiveX control used for scanning and displaying images was found to be vulnerable to crafted attacks. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the bulletin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies within an ActiveX control, making it susceptible to attacks involving specially crafted inputs or data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The bulletin states the control was vulnerable to "crafted hacking", implying that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior on the client machine, as ActiveX controls run with a high degree of privilege within the browser. The full impact is not detailed in the bulletin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious inputs or data that are processed by the vulnerable ActiveX control when a user accesses a website with an embedded vulnerable control. This implies a network attack vector, where an attacker could host malicious content or compromise a legitimate website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious inputs or data to a user's browser which then interacts with the vulnerable ActiveX control. This typically involves the attacker having some control over a website the user visits.
- The attacker does not need to have access to the internal system of the user, since the attack is performed through the browser.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.0.1
- IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.1

**Remediation/Fixes:**
- Apply Fix Pack 2 for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture v8.1.
- An interim GA fix was scheduled for IBM Datacap Taskmaster Capture 8.0.1 in September 2014.
