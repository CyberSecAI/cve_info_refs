Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Ecava IntegraXor application's failure to adequately isolate the "guest" user. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The application's web server does not properly restrict access, allowing the "guest" user (or an anonymous attacker) to run SELECT queries.
- **Insecure Default Access Control:** The default configuration allows guest users to access sensitive data without proper authorization.
- **Clear Text Credentials:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to read administrative credentials in clear text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Administrative Credentials:** An attacker can gain access to administrative credentials, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Unauthorized Access to Data:** Attackers can read sensitive information through SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Network Access:** The attacker exploits the web interface that is connected to the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to access the web interface of the vulnerable system.
- **Low Skill Level:**  The exploit requires low level technical expertise to perform.
- **No authentication required:**  The attacker does not need valid credentials, they can use the default guest access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified by an independent researcher and reported through ZDI and ICS-CERT.
- Ecava has released a patch (version 4.1.4410) to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned to this vulnerability (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
- There were no known public exploits at the time of the advisory publication.
