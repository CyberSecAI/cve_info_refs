Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0157:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Description" fields of Heat templates within the Horizon orchestration dashboard. Specifically, the application was not correctly escaping HTML characters, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the Heat template descriptions, and this code is executed when a user interacts with the template through the Horizon dashboard.

- **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize the "Description" fields, allowing HTML and JavaScript code to be rendered by the browser. The use of `.html()` in the bootstrap tooltip was a key weakness.

- **Autoescaping Bypass:** Although Django autoescapes the help text, the bootstrap-tooltip was retrieving the escaped text and using `.html()` to insert it into the DOM, which bypasses the autoescaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Theft:** An attacker can steal Horizon user/admin access credentials, including session cookies and CSRF tokens.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers could gain access to tenant-confidential information.
- **System Manipulation:** Potentially manipulate VMs and network configurations.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A malicious template could be used to escalate privileges if the user interacting with the template has elevated permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Heat Templates:** The primary attack vector is through malicious Heat templates. These templates can be introduced either by:
    - A malicious template owner directly creating a template.
    - A malicious template catalog providing compromised templates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Heat template creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control Heat templates.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a Horizon user into using the malicious template via the Orchestration/Stack section of the Horizon dashboard.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Horizon versions 2013.2 up to 2013.2.3.
- The vulnerability was found in the orchestration dashboard which is used alongside Heat service.
- The fix involves double-escaping help\_text to avoid bootstrap tooltip XSS, as well as properly escaping untrusted Heat template 'outputs'.

This information is more detailed than the placeholder description, as it specifies the vulnerability type (XSS), the affected component (Horizon Orchestration), the attack vector (malicious Heat templates), and the potential impact (credential theft, information disclosure, system manipulation). It also provides an analysis of the root cause and the fix.
