Subject: [OSSA 2014-010] XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard (CVE-2014-0157)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-010
CVE: CVE-2014-0157
Date: April 08, 2014
Title: XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard
Reporter: Cristian Fiorentino (Intel)
Products: Horizon
Versions: 2013.2 version up to 2013.2.3

Description:
Cristian Fiorentino from Intel reported a vulnerability in Horizon
Orchestration dashboard. By tricking a Horizon user into using a
malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a
remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It may
result in potential assets theft (Horizon user/admin access credentials,
tenants confidential information, etc.). Only setups exposing the
orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86059>

Icehouse (milestone-proposed branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86054>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86056>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-rc2 development milestone and
in a future 2013.2.4 release.

### Bug Description

\*Description\*

XSS vulnerability identified in Horizon-Orchestration while uploading a stack template.

Arbitrary Javascript code may be introduced via the "Description" fields of Heat templates; such code was found to be executed by Horizon.

\*Threat Description\*

-Potential Adversaries: malicious Heat templates owners/malicious Heat templates catalogs.

-Potential Assets: horizon user/admin access credentials (session cookies/CSRF tokens), VMs/Network configuration/management, tenants confidential informartion, etc.

-Potential Threats: Malicious Heat template owner/catalog makes an Horizon user to utilize a malicious template, which once introduced in Horizon obtains user access credentials and send them back to the attacker.

\*Environment\*

One node with Devstack over Ubuntu13.10, latest Icehouse code, Firefox web browser and the following OpenStack configuration:

shell, key, horizon, g-reg, g-api, n-api, n-cpu, n-cond, n-crt, n-net, n-sch, n-novnc, n-xvnc, n-cauth, n-obj, c-api, c-sch, c-vol, ceilometer-acompute, ceilometer-acentral, ceilometer-collector, ceilometer-api, ceilometer-alarm-notifier, ceilometer-alarm-evaluator, h-eng, h-api, h-api-cfn, h-api-cw

\*Steps to reproduce\*

1- Sign-in to Horizon and click on Orchestration/Stack section.

2- Click on "Launch Stack"

3- Select "Direct input", and copy-paste into "Template data" the contents of some template (I have used:

<https://github.com/openstack/heat-templates/blob/master/cfn/F17/AutoScalingMultiAZSample.template>)

4- Update the contents of the DBUsername "Description" field with the following:

   "DBUsername": {

 ...

      "Description" : "<script>alert('XSS!!!')</script>",

 ...

    },

5- Click on Next

6- Being on the Launch Stack form, click on DBUsername text box as if you were going to modify its value.

7- A pop-up saying "XSS!!!" will appear, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

\*How to fix\*

- Perform input validation for "Description" fields in templates (need to take into account all template input methods: upload from URL, upload from file, direct input).

- Perform output sanitization when displaying template's "Description" messages.

Having analyzed the issue, the problems seems to be that the template structure used to display the "Description" message is not performing autoescaping. I will be proving a patch proposal soon.

Question on the process: are Gerrit reviews on security bugs automatically being set to private, or should I perform any additional steps to maintain the review private? Thanks.

Hello Crisitan,

Our gerrit does not support private review, in order to get the patch private, you have to attach them to LP and get the review done here too.

Thank you in advance!

I have tried the patch and it works well to solve the issue. It's a nice general fix to catch this particular exploit in other forms as well.

Please let me know if I am wrong, but I think there is still the need for further reviews on the proposed patch.

Impact description review:

\* I would title it "XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard"

\* the "By tricking" sentence is confusing. i would say "By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It may result in..."

\* the double parenthesis listing the effects is very confusing. I would simplify it a lot.

\* "Only setups using Heat and Horizon are affected." -- do you need to use Heat, or just the orchestration dashboard ? Or would rendering a template in Horizon (without using Heat) also trigger the issue ? In doubt I would just say "Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected".

@ttx Thanks! Concerning the affected setups, the orchestration dashboard should only be displayed if a heat service is defined. Which is better covered by your sentence anyway.

Description:
Cristian Fiorentino from Intel reported a vulnerability in Horizon Orchestration dashboard. By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It may result in potential assets theft (Horizon user/admin access credentials, tenants confidential information, etc.). Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.

Thanks Cristian. The patch fixes the issue for me too. I would really like to understand \*why\* this help\_text variable isn't autoescaped in the original template though. I haven't been able to answer that question.

BUT in reviewing this I've discovered another related issue that we'll need to fix at the same time:

openstack\_dashboard/dashboards/project/stacks/templates/stacks/\_detail\_overview.html uses {% autoescape off %}

This makes Horizon vulnerable to script data inside the "outputs" section of a Heat template:

outputs:

  instance\_ip:

    description: The IP address of the deployed instance

    value: "<script>alert('XSS!!!')</script>"

After a stack is created successfully, clicking through to the detail of that particular stack will run the script.

The original issue is more complicated than it seems. Here's the HTML that's generated without the fix:

<span class="help-block"> &lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;XSS!!!&#39;)&lt;/script&gt; </span>

And with the fix:

<span class="help-block"> &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&amp;#39;XSS!!!&amp;#39;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; </span>

So Django \*is\* autoescaping the help text. The patch above escapes the text a second time. This is also why when I tried making the patch neater by using {{ field.help\_text|force\_escape }}, it didn't fix the bug, as that doesn't result in double-escaping.

The real cause of the bug is feeding the escaped HTML from the <span> tag into bootstrap-tooltip:

$(document).tooltip({

...snip...

    title: function () {

      return $(this).closest('div.form-field').children('.help-block').text();

    }

  });

Which inserts it straight back into the DOM with .html:

$tip.find('.tooltip-inner').html(this.getTitle())

So the text is effectively unescaped once the tooltip is triggered.

Thank you for looking into this, Cristian and Kieran. The patch in comment 16 looks good to me. I tested it on master and can confirm it works well. I haven't had a chance to test it on the Havana branch yet.

Introduces escaping in Horizon/Orchestration

1) Escape help\_text a second time to avoid bootstrap tooltip XSS issue

The "Description" parameter in a Heat template is used to populate

    a help\_text tooltip in the dynamically generated Heat form. Bootstrap

    inserts this tooltip into the DOM using .html() which undoes any

    escaping we do in Django (it should be using .text()).

This was fixed by forcing the help\_text content to be escaped a second

    time. The issue itself is mitigated in bootstrap.js release 2.0.3

    (ours is currently 2.0.1).

2) Properly escape untrusted Heat template 'outputs'

The 'outputs' parameter in a Heat template was included in a Django

    template with HTML autoescaping turned off. Malicious HTML content

    could be included in a Heat template and would be rendered by Horizon

    when details about a created stack were displayed.

This was fixed by not disabling autoescaping and explicitly escaping

    untrusted values in any strings that are later marked "safe" to render

    without further escaping.
