- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient safeguards against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a legitimate user into opening a URL that results in an action being taken as that user, potentially without the knowledge of that user. Any actions taken require that the legitimate user be already authenticated or to authenticate separately as part of the attack.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trick a legitimate user into opening a crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a legitimate user into clicking a malicious URL while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application or is tricked into authenticating as part of the attack.
