Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0093:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Java Security Manager (JSM) permissions configured via a policy file were not properly applied in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect application of Java Security Manager permissions.
- Deployed applications were granted `java.security.AllPermission` regardless of the policy file configurations.
- This effectively bypassed security restrictions intended by the use of JSM.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could circumvent expected security measures.
- The attacker could perform actions that would otherwise be restricted by the JSM.
- Potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability could occur if an attacker manages to deploy an application that takes advantage of the improperly applied security permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to deploy an application within the JBoss EAP environment.
-  The attacker would need to craft an application that exploits the unrestricted permissions.
- No special network location is needed, as deployment could be achieved remotely.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP Quality Engineering team.
- This issue was addressed in JBoss EAP 6.2.2 and later, with updates provided in Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) like RHSA-2014:0343, RHSA-2014:0344, and RHSA-2014:0345.
- Affected products include JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and 6.4 on RHEL 5 and 6.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity by Red Hat.
