Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-0516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the Adobe Flash Player that allows bypassing the Same Origin Policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP). The SOP is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from a different origin, which helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other related attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to circumvent the security restrictions imposed by the SOP. This could enable the attacker to perform actions on a user's behalf on other sites, potentially accessing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves a specially crafted SWF file, which is loaded within a browser using the flash-plugin.
-  The specific vectors for the bypass are not mentioned explicitly in the provided text, but the underlying cause is due to the way flash-plugin handles certain content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious SWF content to the victim. This could be done by:
    - Hosting the malicious SWF file on a website visited by the victim.
    - Embedding the malicious SWF in a website, advertisement, or any other mechanism that would lead the victim's browser to load it.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability is addressed in Flash Player version 11.2.202.359.
-  The issue is also referenced in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-14.
-  Multiple sources indicate that this vulnerability is related to other flaws (CVE-2014-0517, CVE-2014-0518, CVE-2014-0519, and CVE-2014-0520), and that all are addressed in the same update.
