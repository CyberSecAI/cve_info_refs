Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-0602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the NQMcsVarSet ActiveX control in NetIQ Security Manager versions prior to 6.5.4 Hotfix 20140606. This ActiveX control contained a vulnerable method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerable method in the NQMcsVarSet ActiveX control allowed for arbitrary code execution.
- It also allowed directory traversal which could potentially be used to access sensitive files or resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system where NetIQ Security Manager is installed.
- This could allow the attacker to gain control of the system or perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a vulnerable method of NQMcsVarSet ActiveX control, which suggests a web-based attack vector
- User interaction is required for exploitation to occur. The user would likely need to interact with a malicious webpage or file that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user of a system running vulnerable NetIQ Security Manager into interacting with malicious content to trigger the vulnerability, given that user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content explicitly links to the CVE page and identifies it as the root cause of vulnerability.
- The vendor (NetIQ/Micro Focus) provides a clear explanation of the cause, impact, and resolution.
- The vendor states that starting with Security Manager 6.5.4 Hotfix 20120606 (should be 20140606), the vulnerable method is no longer used, therefore the vulnerability is remediated.
