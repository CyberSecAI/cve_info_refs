{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A missing check during the assembly of the HTTP request line in the PROXY-CONNECT address processing leads to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation when handling the target server name in the PROXY-CONNECT address.",
      "Missing length check during the assembly of HTTP request line in PROXY-CONNECT functionality."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service due to a segmentation fault. It may potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated and is a common consequence of buffer overflows.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted command line argument to the socat program, specifically within the PROXY-CONNECT address. An attacker needs to supply an overly long target server name."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide the target server name to the PROXY-CONNECT address in the command line. This could occur when using scripts or applications that pass data from untrusted sources directly into socat command arguments."

    "1.7.2.3 and later",

        "Truncate the target server name to a maximum of 256 characters before passing it to socat's command line."
