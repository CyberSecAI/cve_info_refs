Socat security advisory 5 - PROXY-CONNECT address overflow
Overview
socats PROXY-CONNECT address is vulnerable to a buffer overflow with
data from command line
Vulnerability Id: CVE-2014-0019
Severity: Low
Details
Due to a missing check during assembly of the HTTP request line a
long target server name ( in the documentation) in
the PROXY-CONNECT address can cause a stack buffer overrun.
Exploitation requires that the attacker is able to provide the
target server name to the PROXY-CONNECT address in the command
line. This can happen for example in scripts that receive data
from untrusted sources.
Testcase
This overflow can not always be reliably reproduced. It may be helpful
to build socat with gcc option -Wp,-D\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE=2 or to run socat
under ElectricFence or another memory checker.
In one terminal run a dummy server because socat first needs to
establish a connection:
socat tcp-l:8080,reuseaddr /dev/null
In a second terminal run the check:
socat - PROXY-CONNECT:localhost:$(perl -e "print 'A' x 384"):1,proxyport=8080
If this command terminates with Segmentation Violation, with a
buffer overflow message or similar, your version of socat is
vulnerable.
However, a Connection refused message does not necessarily mean that your
version is not vulnerable!
Affected versions
1.3.0.0 - 1.7.2.2
2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b6
Not affected or corrected versions
1.0.0.0 - 1.2.0.0
1.7.2.3 and later
2.0.0-b7 and later
Workaround
Truncate the target server name to a length of 256 characters before
passing it to socats command line

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=927161#c0)  Ruediger Meier   2015-04-14 19:02:45 UTC  ``` socat crashes on OBS build host when trying to listen or writing UNIX domain sockets. It happens mostly on ppc or armv7l only. socat from openSUSE 13.2 works. Seems the bug is fixed in 1.7.2.4  I'd like to prepare a maintenance update from socat 1.7.2.2 to 1.7.2.4 if that would be ok.  Reproducible for example like this:  $ socat -u UNIX-LISTEN:socket,fork,max-children=1,backlog=128 STDOUT > outfile $ socat -u /dev/null UNIX-CONNECT:socket  ...*** stack smashing detected ***: socat terminated ======= Backtrace: ========= /lib/libc.so.6(+0x7e140)[0xfb4e140] /lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x4c)[0xfbd468c] /lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x0)[0xfbd4640] socat[0x100131a8] socat[0x100132c8] socat[0x10016320] socat[0x10008a18] socat[0x10008af0] socat[0x10007130] socat[0x10003e8c] /lib/libc.so.6(+0x23330)[0xfaf3330] /lib/libc.so.6(+0x234c0)[0xfaf34c0] ======= Memory map: ======== 00100000-00120000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                                  [vdso] 0fa10000-0fa30000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720965                             /lib/libz.so.1.2.8 0fa30000-0fa40000 rw-p 00010000 fe:00 720965                             /lib/libz.so.1.2.8 0fa50000-0fa60000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720916                             /lib/libdl-2.18.so 0fa60000-0fa70000 rw-p 00000000 fe:00 720916                             /lib/libdl-2.18.so 0fa80000-0fab0000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720973                             /lib/libtinfo.so.5.9 0fab0000-0fac0000 rw-p 00020000 fe:00 720973                             /lib/libtinfo.so.5.9 0fad0000-0fc60000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720910                             /lib/libc-2.18.so 0fc60000-0fc70000 rw-p 00180000 fe:00 720910                             /lib/libc-2.18.so 0fc70000-0fc80000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 0fc90000-0fe70000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 721059                             /lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 0fe70000-0fe80000 r--p 001e0000 fe:00 721059                             /lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 0fe80000-0fe90000 rw-p 001f0000 fe:00 721059                             /lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 0fea0000-0ff10000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 721060                             /lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 0ff10000-0ff20000 rw-p 00060000 fe:00 721060                             /lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 0ff30000-0ff80000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720978                             /lib/libreadline.so.6.2 0ff80000-0ff90000 rw-p 00040000 fe:00 720978                             /lib/libreadline.so.6.2 0ffa0000-0ffb0000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 720946                             /lib/libutil-2.18.so 0ffb0000-0ffc0000 rw-p 00000000 fe:00 720946                             /lib/libutil-2.18.so 0ffd0000-0ffe0000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 721069                             /lib/libwrap.so.0.7.6 0ffe0000-0fff0000 rw-p 00000000 fe:00 721069                             /lib/libwrap.so.0.7.6 10000000-10050000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 313811                             /usr/bin/socat 10050000-10060000 rw-p 00040000 fe:00 313811                             /usr/bin/socat 10060000-100a0000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 10790000-107c0000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap] f79c0000-f79d0000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 f79d0000-f7a00000 r-xp 00000000 fe:00 721038                             /lib/ld-2.18.so f7a00000-f7a10000 rw-p 00020000 fe:00 721038                             /lib/ld-2.18.so ff990000-ff9c0000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [stack] /home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/util-linux-2.26.git211.276f1/tests/ts/logger/../../functions.sh: line 679:  3028 Aborted                 socat -u /dev/null UNIX-CONNECT:$socket ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=927161#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2015-04-15 05:51:06 UTC  ``` would the version update fix it? :) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=927161#c2)  Ruediger Meier   2015-04-15 08:17:39 UTC  ``` I've checked again. A fresh rebuild of the same version 1.7.2.2 already fixes the problem. Seems like it's just a bad build which made it into the release.  Nevertheless 1.7.2.4 mentions some issues which could have something to do with this bug. There are even other important issues fixed, see changelog below.

## What's new?

### Recent Releases

2024-12-11: Socat [version 1.8.0.2](download/socat-1.8.0.2.tar.gz) has been released. It fixes an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability in readline.sh ([Socat security advisory 9](contrib/socat-secadv9.html), CVE-2024-54661)

2024-08-24: Socat [version 1.8.0.1](download/socat-1.8.0.1.tar.gz) has been released. It fixes a couple of regressions in version 1.8.0.0 (see below), and a few other minor issues, see file <CHANGES>

#### Failures report for 1.8.0.0

A group of failures in Socat version 1.8.0.0 have been reported for commands that worked fine in previous versions (regression). They affect addresses using IP protocols without explicit IP version, with options bind and/or range.
Examples are TCP-LISTEN, UDP, UDP-RECV, OPENSSL.
The error messages are:

* E syntax error in "localhost"
* E syntax error in range "127.0.0.1/8" of unspecified address family: use <addr>:<mask>
* E xioopen\_ipdgram\_listen(): unknown address family 0
* E getaddrinfo("127.0.0.1", "NULL", {0x01,10,2,17}, {}): Address family for hostname not supported
* E xioparsenetwork\_ip6("localhost:255.255.255.255",,): missing mask bits delimiter '/'
* E missing brackets for IPv6 range definition "127.0.0.1/8"

These issues will be addressed by version 1.8.0.1, planned for **August**; possible workarounds are:

* Use Socat up to version 1.7.4.4 (or 1.7.4.5 from git)
* Apply option -4 (does not help in some cases)
* Use explicit IP version in address key word like TCP4-LISTEN, UDP4 etc;
* Add address option pf=ip4 (esp.with OPENSSL)

2023-11-13: Socat [version 1.8.0.0](download/socat-1.8.0.0.tar.gz) has been released. It adds a couple of new features:

* Support for **network namespaces** ([option netns](doc/socat.html#OPTION_NETNS))
* TCP client now automatically **tries all addresses** (IPv4 and IPv6) provided by nameserver until success
* Implementation of **POSIX message queue** (mq) control and access on Linux ([addresses POSIXMQ-READ and following](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_POSIXMQ_READ))
* New wrapper script socat-chain.sh allows to **stack two addresses**, e.g.HTTP proxy connect over SSL
* New script socat-mux.sh allows **n-to-1 / 1-to-n communications**
* New script socat-broker.sh allows **group communications**
* Experimental [**socks5 client**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SOCKS5_CONNECT) feature
* Address [ACCEPT-FD](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_ACCEPT_FD) for **systemd "inetd" mode**
* [**UDP-Lite**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_UDP6_RECV) and [**DCCP**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_DCCP_CONNECT) address types
* Addresses [**SOCKETPAIR**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SOCKETPAIR) and [**SHELL**](doc/socat.html#ADDRESS_SHELL)* New [option bind-tmpname](doc/socat.html#OPTION_UNIX_BIND_TEMPNAME) allows forked off children to **bind UNIX** domain client sockets to random **unique pathes**
  * New [option retrieve-vlan](doc/socat.html#OPTION_RETRIEVE_VLAN) (with INTERFACE addresses) now makes kernel **keep VLAN tags** in incoming packets
  * Simple **statistics output** with [Socat option --statistics](doc/socat.html#option_statistics) and with SIGUSR1
  * A couple of new options, many fixes and corrections, see file <CHANGES>

**Notes to distribution maintainers and packagers:**

* Socat now installs as socat1, and a symlink socat points to it, same with man page
* test.sh now provides option "--expect-fail 123,216" to gain rc=0 even with some failures

## History

# Socat security advisory 5 - PROXY-CONNECT address overflow

Socat security advisory 5 - PROXY-CONNECT address overflow

Overview
  socats PROXY-CONNECT address is vulnerable to a buffer overflow with
  data from command line

Vulnerability Id: CVE-2014-0019

Serverity: Low

Details
  Due to a missing check during assembly of the HTTP request line a
  long target server name (<hostname> in the documentation) in
  the PROXY-CONNECT address can cause a stack buffer overrun.
  Exploitation requires that the attacker is able to provide the
  target server name to the PROXY-CONNECT address in the command
  line. This can happen for example in scripts that receive data
  from untrusted sources.

Testcase
  This overflow can not always be reliably reproduced. It may be helpful
  to build socat with gcc option -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 or to run socat
  under ElectricFence or another memory checker.

  In one terminal run a dummy server because socat first needs to
  establish a connection:

    socat tcp-l:8080,reuseaddr /dev/null

  In a second terminal run the check:

    socat - PROXY-CONNECT:localhost:$(perl -e "print 'A' x
384"):1,proxyport=8080

  If this command terminates with Segmentation Violation, with a
  buffer overflow message or similar, your version of socat is
  vulnerable.

  However, a Connection refused message does not necessarily mean that your
  version is not vulnerable!

Affected versions
  1.3.0.0 - 1.7.2.2
  2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b6

Not affected or corrected versions
  1.0.0.0 - 1.2.0.0
  1.7.2.3 and later
  2.0.0-b7 and later

Workaround
  Truncate the target server name to a length of 256 characters before
  passing it to socats command line
