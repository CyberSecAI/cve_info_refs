{
  "CVE-2014-0048": {
    "Root cause": "Docker was downloading and executing programs/scripts via HTTP, instead of HTTPS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure downloading of resources",
      "Unsafe execution of downloaded content"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential for arbitrary code execution and compromise of the system. Downloading signing keys over HTTP instead of HTTPS could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Man-in-the-middle position to intercept HTTP traffic.",
        "More details": "Sensitive content like Debian signing keys were being downloaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This could lead to execution of malicious code or the system being compromised"
  }
}
