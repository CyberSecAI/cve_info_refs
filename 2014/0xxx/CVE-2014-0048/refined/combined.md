| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1063550#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-11 01:33:59 UTC  ``` Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team reports:  There are a number of programs and scripts in Docker that download content via  HTTP and then execute the content or use it in other unsafe ways (e.g. signing keys used to further verify content that is downloaded and executed).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1063550#c2)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-24 05:19:04 UTC  ``` I can't speak for the build process etc. but monitoring 1.5 on the network I no longer detect any http traffic when issuing a docker pull. Anything else (e.g. bad Dockerfile hygeine) is a separate issue.   ``` |  |

tjay@  (our docker guy) verified they were fixed as you can see from his

No, this was stuff like downloading debian signing keys over http rather

It would seem so, yes.

For the 'tmp' issue, we were contacted at Docker about tmp directory usage
during building or running of tests for Docker itself. It is not clear if
CVE-2014-0047 is a reflection of this, but it appears so. In that specific
case, we performed triage and determined that either no such abuses of tmp
existed at the time, or that those uses of tmp were run within containers
in such a way that no vulnerability existed.

duplicate of CVE-2014-5277 (HTTP downgrade attack against registry).

Both of these reports precede the establishment of a focused security team
and process at Docker.

Eric Windisch

There is no hard information in those bug reports.  It's not clear
what, precisely, they are about, and so it is impossible to tell if
they actually have been fixed.  I appreciate that you clean out old
stuff, but doing it this way makes it seem you suddenly have developed
a policy for secrecy around security issues.

(CVE-2014-0048)

Could this be a dupe of the index.docker.io registry misconfiguration
that had at least one redirect to http:// (now fixed) for the actual
(unverified) image data?

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
