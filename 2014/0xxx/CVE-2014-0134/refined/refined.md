Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way OpenStack Nova handles image formats during instance rescue operations, specifically when using libvirt and raw images (`use_cow_images = False`).  When an instance is put into rescue mode, Nova attempts to determine the disk image format. A malicious user can overwrite the disk inside a running VM with a crafted qcow2 image that has an arbitrary file path specified as its backing file. When the instance is rescued, Nova's libvirt driver probes the disk format again. Since the disk is overwritten with a qcow2 image (even if backed by a raw file), it will incorrectly identify it as a qcow2 disk, thus exposing the host path to the rescued instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Image Format Guessing:** The libvirt driver in Nova incorrectly guesses the image format during rescue, instead of relying on the original image format.
- **Lack of Enforcement:** Nova doesn't enforce the image format during the rescue process, allowing an attacker to influence the detected disk format.
- **Exposure of Host File System:** By misidentifying the image as qcow2, Nova exposes the file specified as the backing file in the malicious qcow2 image to the rescued VM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Host Data Leakage:** An authenticated user can read arbitrary files from the compute host within the VM by crafting a malicious qcow2 image with a backing file pointing to the desired host file.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information on the host could be exposed to the malicious user.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Crafted Malicious Image:** An attacker crafts a qcow2 image with a backing file that points to a file on the compute host that they wish to access.
2.  **Instance Disk Overwrite:** The attacker overwrites the disk of a running instance with the crafted qcow2 image.
3.  **Rescue Operation:** The attacker shuts down the instance and places it in rescue mode.
4.  **Host File Access:** During rescue, the libvirt driver exposes the host file specified in the qcow2 image's backing file as a disk to the rescued VM.  The attacker can then read this file within the rescue VM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the OpenStack cloud, capable of creating and managing instances.
- **Instance Control:** The attacker must have control over an instance to overwrite its disk.
- **`use_cow_images = False` Configuration:** The compute environment must have `use_cow_images` set to `False` in Nova configuration.
- **Libvirt/KVM Environment:** The environment must be using libvirt to spawn instances.

**Mitigating factors:**

- **File permissions:** files have to be readable by libvirt/kvm
- **Apparmor/SELinux:** Apparmor/selinux will limit the number of accessible files
- **Block visibility**: Only full blocks of the file are visible in the rescued instance, so short files will not be available at all and long files are going to be truncated

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by a patch that tried to determine the image format by using `qemu-img info`.
- The fix involves creating a `disk.info` file per instance, stored in the instance directory, that persists the detected image format on initial boot. This prevents re-probing during rescues and other operations.
- The fix was applied to both `stable/havana` and `master` branches of Nova.
- The affected versions of Nova are `2013.2` versions up to `2013.2.2`.
