Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in JBoss RichFaces when handling certain malformed requests. Specifically, the `PushHandlerFilter` in RichFaces was not properly releasing resources when processing these malformed requests, especially when using the Atmosphere framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The core vulnerability is a memory leak caused by improper handling of malformed requests by the `PushHandlerFilter`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application is not adequately validating or sanitizing the incoming requests leading to the memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending a large number of malformed requests to a RichFaces application. The application server, in turn, consumes excessive memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Malformed HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to send specifically crafted malformed HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. These malformed requests trigger the memory leak in RichFaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running a vulnerable RichFaces application.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not need any specific knowledge beyond knowing that the target uses RichFaces with the Atmosphere framework.

*   The issue is tracked in JBoss bug tracker as RF-13250 ([https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-13250](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-13250)).
*   Red Hat has addressed this issue in:
    *   Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 (RHSA-2014:0335)
    *   JBoss Portal 6.2.0 (RHSA-2015:1009)
*   The code commit on GitHub ([https://github.com/pslegr/core-1/commit/8131f15003f5bec73d475d2b724472e4b87d0757](https://github.com/pslegr/core-1/commit/8131f15003f5bec73d475d2b724472e4b87d0757)) shows a patch to the `PushHandlerFilter.java` file that addresses the memory leak, specifically within the `doFilter` method and related to the handling of `Meteor` requests
