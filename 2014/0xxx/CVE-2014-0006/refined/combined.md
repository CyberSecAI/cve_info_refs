### Bug Description

Swift's TempURL middleware compares a user-submitted string (HMAC digest) against a list of valid strings to determine whether or not to allow access to an object. The string comparison uses Python's builtin string comparison, which short-circuits evaluation on the first differing character, which may let an attacker perform timing analysis.

The attached patch changes the string comparison to be constant-time.

Looks like TempURL came in with Swift 1.4.6, which was released in Feb 2012.

Okay, so that means Essex from an integrated release perspective? In that case we're going to need stable/grizzly and stable/havana series tasks and backport patches.

That impact description looks fine to me. Would it help at all (from a risk identification perspective) to point out that this exploit involves identifying objects at random, and so poses additional hurdles for any sort of targeted attack (needle in haystack situation)?

I think that yes, it would be helpful to mention that an object name must already be known in order to use this attack.

Also, the object's account must have a TempURL key set (X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key or X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key-2) in order for this to work; without that, there are no valid signatures at all, so no amount of timing analysis will help.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## What is OpenDev?

OpenDev is a collaboratory for open source software
development at scale. Its focus is on code review, continuous
integration, and project hosting provided exclusively through open source
solutions like Git, Gerrit, Zuul, and Gitea. It also provides a number of
peripheral collaboration services (like Mailman mailing lists, IRC bots for
notifications and annotating text-based meetings, Jitsi-Meet for
videoconference discussions integrated with Etherpad for collective text
editing). All of these services are openly operated by the community, and
continuously integrated and deployed using OpenDev itself.

## How is development different with OpenDev

OpenDev doesn't use a pull request (or merge request)
workflow, like those implemented by GitHub or Gitlab. Instead it follows
Gerrit's iterative change proposal workflow, which results in a slightly
different experience.

In GitHub or Gitlab, contribution typically starts by
forking a personal copy of the original repository, cloning that locally, and
pushing one or more commits to that personal fork. Once your code seems ready
to merge, you ask the service to create a pull request for your branch into the
original repository. The pull request is reviewed, and if accepted your changes
get merged into the original repository. If not, you push more commits to your
fork and update the request seeking more reviews.

By contrast, contribution with Gerrit starts by cloning
the original repository locally. You iterate on development of one or more
local commits, and then use git push (or the git-review tool) to propose your
commits as a series of changes to the Gerrit code review service. Each change
in the series is reviewed, and if it's accepted (and passing tests) then it
gets merged into the original repository. If more work is needed, you amend
the same commits and push new versions of them for re-review.

The difference is subtle, but significant. In the
pull request model, you create a fork of the original repository, push
changes to it, and ultimately propose to merge changes back. In the change
proposal model, you prepare a change, and propose it. You do not create a
complete fork and everyone contributes into the same original repository with
what are basically lightweight, ephemeral topic branches. It results in less
fragmentation overall, and avoids confusion between the original repository and
its numerous forks.

That high-level difference also affects lower-level
details. A pull request may contain several commits, and if merged all those
commits will appear in the original repository history. In Gerrit, every commit
is a separate change (optionally depending on other related changes) for code
reviewers to review, so developers squash or amend edits made while developing
to represent the desired final state of that change. Each prior revision of a
change is still retained by the service, as are all the review comments, so
updates can be compared side-by-side for a clear picture of how the change
evolved. It generally results in easier code review, but also a cleaner branch
history with the commit messages reviewed as an integral part of each
change.

In summary, the Gerrit workflow, its user experience and
UI are different from the pull request workflow. While it may not be
immediately familiar to developers used to pull request workflows, it's worth
learning. Long-term benefits outweigh the short-term cost of having to learn a
new tool, especially for someone who is going to spend a lot of time developing
for that project anyway.

## Integrated Continuous Integration

One key benefit of OpenDev is that it integrates
powerful continuous integration features, made possible by the donation of
compute resources from our generous infrastructure partners. Test jobs are
run when changes are proposed and provide code reviewers with valuable
information. Test jobs also run again at merge time, in case recently approved
changes introduce an incompatibility, preventing code which doesn't pass tests
from merging to the repository.

Advanced Zuul features like speculative execution of
tests allow the testing of sequenced changes in parallel, so development
velocity is rarely limited by how thorough you want your tests to be. Changes
in one Git repository can depend on proposed changes in another repository,
allowing integration testing of features actively developed across multiple
projects, removing artificial barriers between development teams.

This advanced continuous integration system was
developed to sustain the complexity and scale of OpenStack development, one of
the three most actively developed open source projects in the world. OpenDev
makes this system available to other projects, enabling open development at
scale for everyone.

## Free software needs free tools

Finally, another key difference between OpenDev and
other development infrastructure services like GitHub or Gitlab.com is that
it's built purely using open source software. GitHub and Gitlab.com are
provided free of charge for open source projects, but they are both implemented
using proprietary code. If development of your free and open source software
requires interaction with proprietary code, is it truly free (as in
freedom)?

It is widely accepted today that using open source
technology reduces your reliance on outside parties and enables innovation. It
should be obvious that developing software by using open source toolchains has
the same effect. Nothing prevents a service provider from changing its terms of
service, creating new limitations, blocking access for contributors connecting
from specific countries, or even fully removing your project. Proprietary
development services create the same form of hard limits, lock-in and
dependency that proprietary software does, and prevent open innovation in the
development infrastructure space.

OpenDev is entirely built using open source software,
but goes one step beyond: it is also openly operated. Even its operation
tooling and configuration is open source, lives in Git, and is
continuously-deployed. It serves as a clear example of transparent
collaboration for systems administration. Like free and open source software,
it requires engaging with its community to get the most of it -- OpenDev is not
a service you consume, it's a community you join. That can be a bit
overwhelming if you just want to focus on development, especially when
ready-to-consume services are available. But it's worth it, especially if you
want to have a say in what services are provided, or just support the idea of
improving open source tools in that space.

## FAQ

### Isn’t this just OpenStack Infrastructure rebranded?

It is more than that. We want to make this toolset
available to others that would find it helpful. OpenStack is one of the OpenDev
tenants, but other tenants like Zuul or $gizmo would be just as important.

### Can I host my project on OpenDev?

Yes! However, as noted above it is still early days yet
and the early experience might be a bit bumpy. Certain things may still say
“OpenStack” on them as we figure out the transition. And while any moves should
come with appropriate redirects, we may have some inadvertent misses.

### Can I run tests on Windows or OSX machines?

Currently all of our test resources are Linux based.
Adding additional platforms would likely require someone to help us get that
running, but Zuul will support systems with ansible connection plugins.
Talk to us!

### I am an existing OpenStack Infra user do I need to do anything?

No. We’ll continue to communicate changes as they
happen. We’ll also do our best to make this as smooth a transition as
possible. If we run into situations that force us to break something we’ll
be sure to let you know at that point.

### Is a CLA required for hosted repos?

No.

### What if I don’t like Gerrit and would prefer (insert tool here)?

We’ve got a fair bit of experience with the existing
toolset and adding new tools for which we’ve already got an answer is currently
out of scope. We think the existing tools (like Gerrit) work well, and should
only get better as we update them. The system is able to scale because we do
not need multiple implementations of different software that solve similar
problems.

### Why can't we use Gitea's issue tracker and wiki?

For scaling and redundancy purposes we are actually
running a number of independent Giteas behind a load balancer. We can keep
Git repos in sync from Gerrit reasonably well, but the issue tracker and
wiki functionality would need another level of state syncing. Once Gitea
can be run as a proper cluster this may change, but until then the
functionality is limited.

Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:52:39 +0100

Subject: [OSSA 2014-002] Swift TempURL timing attack (CVE-2014-0006)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-002
CVE: CVE-2014-0006
Date: January 16, 2013
Title: Swift TempURL timing attack
Reporter: Samuel Merritt (SwiftStack)
Products: Swift
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Samuel Merritt from SwiftStack reported a timing attack vulnerability in
Swift TempURL middleware. By analyzing response times to arbitrary
TempURL requests, an attacker may be able to guess valid secret URLs and
get access to objects that were only intended to be publicly shared with
specific recipients. In order to use this attack, the attacker needs to
know the targeted object name, and the object account needs to have a
TempURL key set. Only Swift setups enabling the TempURL middleware are
affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67185/>

Havana (1.10.0) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67186/>

Grizzly (1.8.0) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/67187/>

Note: the Icehouse fix will be included in upcoming 1.12.0 release.

### Bug Description

Swift's TempURL middleware compares a user-submitted string (HMAC digest) against a list of valid strings to determine whether or not to allow access to an object. The string comparison uses Python's builtin string comparison, which short-circuits evaluation on the first differing character, which may let an attacker perform timing analysis.

The attached patch changes the string comparison to be constant-time.

Okay, so that means Essex from an integrated release perspective? In that case we're going to need stable/grizzly and stable/havana series tasks and backport patches.

That impact description looks fine to me. Would it help at all (from a risk identification perspective) to point out that this exploit involves identifying objects at random, and so poses additional hurdles for any sort of targeted attack (needle in haystack situation)?

I think that yes, it would be helpful to mention that an object name must already be known in order to use this attack.

Also, the object's account must have a TempURL key set (X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key or X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key-2) in order for this to work; without that, there are no valid signatures at all, so no amount of timing analysis will help.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1051670#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-10 20:41:03 UTC  ``` Thierry Carrez of the Openstack project reports:  Title: Swift TempURL timing attack Reporter: Samuel Merritt (SwiftStack) Products: Swift Affects: All supported versions  Description: Samuel Merritt from SwiftStack reported a timing attack vulnerability in Swift TempURL middleware. By analyzing response times to arbitrary TempURL requests, an attacker may be able to guess valid secret URLs and get access to objects that were only intended to be publicly shared with specific recipients. In order to use this attack, the attacker needs to know the targeted object name, and the object account needs to have a TempURL key set. Only Swift setups enabling the TempURL middleware are affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1051670#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-10 20:46:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 848380](attachment.cgi?id=848380&action=diff "CVE-2014-0006-grizzly.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=848380&action=edit "CVE-2014-0006-grizzly.diff") CVE-2014-0006-grizzly.diff   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1051670#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-10 20:46:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 848381](attachment.cgi?id=848381&action=diff "CVE-2014-0006-havana.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=848381&action=edit "CVE-2014-0006-havana.diff") CVE-2014-0006-havana.diff   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1051670#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-10 20:47:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 848382](attachment.cgi?id=848382&action=diff "CVE-2014-0006-master.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=848382&action=edit "CVE-2014-0006-master.diff") CVE-2014-0006-master.diff   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1051670#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2014-01-10 20:47:59 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Openstack Project for reporting this issue.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0232)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
deployment.

A timing attack flaw was found in the way the swift TempURL middleware
responded to arbitrary TempURL requests. An attacker with knowledge of an
object's name could use this flaw to obtain a secret URL to this object,
which was intended to be publicly shared only with specific recipients, if
the object had the TempURL key set. Note that only setups using the TempURL
middleware were affected. (CVE-2014-0006)

Red Hat would like to thank the Openstack Project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Samuel Merritt of SwiftStack as the original
reporter.

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
