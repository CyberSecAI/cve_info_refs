```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The TempURL middleware in OpenStack Swift uses Python's built-in string comparison, which short-circuits evaluation on the first differing character. This allows an attacker to perform timing analysis by observing response times to arbitrary TempURL requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability due to short-circuiting string comparison in TempURL middleware."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can guess valid secret URLs and gain access to objects that were intended to be shared only with specific recipients.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Analyzing response times to arbitrary TempURL requests."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the targeted object name and the object's account must have a TempURL key set (X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key or X-Account-Meta-Temp-URL-Key-2).",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in Swift versions that enable the TempURL middleware (introduced in Swift 1.4.6). Patches were created for stable/grizzly (1.8.0), stable/havana (1.10.0), and master."
