#### Description

ListNetworkACL API should filter ACLs by caller and list ACLs which can be accessed by the user only.

If API call is not called with a networkid or other filter, every ACL in the system is dumped, which is both a performance issue and a security issue. If a networkid is provided, but the network doesn't have an ACL list or any ACL items attached, the same issue occurs.

Likewise, listNetworkACLLists gives access to see non-owned lists, which in turn gives vpc ids for non-owned resources.

Example:

1. Set up a zone

2. Create a VPC or network as admin

3. Create an ACL list for the network

4. Create a new domain and unprivileged user

5. Generate API keys for user

6. Issue a 'listNetworkACLs' API call. You should see the ACL list items from the admin-owned list

7. Issue a 'listNetworkACLLists' API call referencing aclid from non-owned acl item. You should see the acl list info and which vpc it belongs to.

8. Listing the vpc attached to the acl list properly stops with an 'unauthorized' response as step 7 above should.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
