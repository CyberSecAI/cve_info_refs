**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.
