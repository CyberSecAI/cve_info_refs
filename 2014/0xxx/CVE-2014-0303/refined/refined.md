        "source": "docs.microsoft.com_8d8c513b_20250124_175422.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.",

This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Internet Explorer. They could also leverage compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content or ads. Users would need to be convinced to visit these malicious sites, typically through links in emails or instant messages.",
