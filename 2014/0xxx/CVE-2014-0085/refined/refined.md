{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "JBoss Fuse did not enable encrypted passwords by default when using Apache Zookeeper. This resulted in admin user's password being stored in cleartext in log files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cleartext storage of sensitive data (admin password) in log files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could read the plaintext password from the logs and use it to gain administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system where the logs are stored.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system."
