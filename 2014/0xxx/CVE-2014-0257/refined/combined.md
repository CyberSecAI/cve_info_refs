How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2916607)

Published: February 11, 2014 | Updated: September 24, 2014

**Version:** 1.3

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits a specially crafted website or a website containing specially crafted web content. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the compromised website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3, Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 on affected editions of Microsoft Windows.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework by correcting how it terminates stale or closed HTTP requests that are started by clients, by improving how it deems a method safe for execution, and by ensuring that it properly implements Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912).

## POST Request DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0253

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Microsoft ASP.NET that could allow an attacker to cause an ASP.NET server to become unresponsive.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0253).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on any supported edition of Microsoft Windows. To be affected by the vulnerability, customers must manually install and enable ASP.NET by registering it with IIS.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configure the <serverRuntime>, <requestLimits>, and <httpRuntime> elements so that requests that attempt to exploit the vulnerability are rejected**

  To block requests that attempt to exploit the vulnerability, in the ASP.NET configuration file for the application configure the following:

  1. Set the **httpRuntime/maxRequestLength** attribute to a specific value that is appropriate for your application. The default value is 4096 KB.
     For more information on this attribute, see [httpRuntime Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641%28v%3Dvs.100%29.aspx).
  2. Set the **requestLimits/maxAllowedContentLength** attribute to a value equal to the maxRequestLength configured in step 1. Note that this value is specified in bytes rather than kilobytes.
     For more information on this attribute, see [Request Limits <requestLimits>](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering/requestlimits).
  3. Set the **serverRuntime/uploadReadAheadSize** attribute to a value equal to the maxRequestLength configured in step 1. Note that this value is specified in bytes rather than kilobytes.
     For more information on this attribute, see [Server Runtime <serverRuntime>](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/serverruntime).

     **Note** The developer should set the above attributes to a value appropriate for the application. The example below shows setting the value to 32 KB.

     ```
             <system.web>
               <httpruntime maxrequestlength="32">
            </httpruntime></system.web>
            <system.webserver>
               <security>
                  <requestfiltering>
                     <requestlimits maxallowedcontentlength="32768">
                  </requestlimits></requestfiltering>
               </security>
               <serverruntime enabled="true">
            </serverruntime></system.webserver>

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** These limits are set by the developer and could have negative performance implications.

## VSAVB7RT ASLR Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0295

A security feature bypass exists in a .NET Framework component that does not properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature, after which the attacker could load additional malicious code in the process in an attempt to exploit another vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0295](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0295).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Install the Force ASLR feature hotfix and enable the IFEO registry entry**

  The Force ASLR feature, which is an addition to the ASLR feature for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, makes it possible for applications to forcibly relocated images that are not built with the /DYNAMICBASE linker flag. Once installed, computer administrators and software developers can enable the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) in the registry to force ASLR behavior for non-ASLR images.

  For more information and installation instructions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308).

  **Impact of workaround.** Forcibly relocates images that are not built with support for ASLR, which can cause application compatibility problems.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308) for information on setting the IFEO registry entry to the default setting.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a security feature bypass vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because specific .NET Framework components were not built to implement the ASLR security feature. As a result, an attacker can more reliably predict memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.

**What is ASLR?**

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) moves executable images into random locations when a system boots, which helps prevent an attacker from leveraging data at predictable locations. For a component to support ASLR, all components that it loads must also support ASLR. For example, if A.exe consumes B.dll and C.dll, all three must support ASLR. By default, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 will randomize system DLLs and EXEs, but DLLs and EXEs created by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) must opt in to support ASLR using the /DYNAMICBASE linker option.

ASLR also randomizes heap and stack memory:

* When an application creates a heap in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2, the heap manager will create that heap at a random location to help reduce the chance that an attempt to exploit a heap-based buffer overrun succeeds. Heap randomization is enabled by default for all applications running on Windows Vista and later.
* When a thread starts in a process linked with /DYNAMICBASE, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 move the thread's stack to a random location to help reduce the chance that a stack-based buffer overrun exploit will succeed.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In a web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the ASLR security feature, which protects users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

When a user visits a website that contains malicious content using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components, such as Internet Explorer, the affected .NET Framework component can be loaded to bypass ASLR.

An attacker could tie this security feature bypass vulnerability to an additional vulnerability, usually a remote code execution vulnerability. The additional vulnerability would take advantage of the security feature bypass for exploitation. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

In the web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**
Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that the .NET Framework component properly implements ASLR.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-0295](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0295).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
