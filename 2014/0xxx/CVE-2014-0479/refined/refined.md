Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `reportbug` tool's handling of version numbers when comparing them. Specifically, it uses `os.system` to compare versions, allowing for the injection of shell metacharacters into the version number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code.
- **Shell Injection:** By including shell metacharacters within a version number, an attacker can inject commands that will be executed by the system.
- **Insecure use of `os.system`:** The use of `os.system` with untrusted input (in this case, the version number) allows for command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the `reportbug` tool. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attack relies on a MitM attacker who can manipulate the version number before it reaches the `reportbug` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MitM Position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic to inject malicious shell characters into the version number.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `reportbug` versions prior to 6.4.4+deb7u1 (for Debian stable/wheezy) and 6.5.0+nmu1 (for Debian unstable/sid).
*   The fix involves removing the use of `os.system` for version comparisons and instead using a secure method.
*   Ubuntu also addressed this vulnerability in various releases, including precise, trusty, and utopic.
*   The specific file that was patched is reportbug/checkversions.py.

In summary, CVE-2014-0479 describes a vulnerability in `reportbug` that could allow a MitM attacker to inject shell commands via manipulated version numbers, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was fixed by removing the use of `os.system` for version comparisons.
