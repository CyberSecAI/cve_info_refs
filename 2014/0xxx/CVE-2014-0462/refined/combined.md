## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [openjdk-6](/security/cves?package=openjdk-6) - Open Source Java implementation

## Details

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to

information disclosure, data integrity and availability. An attacker could

exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive data over

the network. ([CVE-2014-0429](/security/CVE-2014-0429), [CVE-2014-0446](/security/CVE-2014-0446), [CVE-2014-0451](/security/CVE-2014-0451), [CVE-2014-0452](/security/CVE-2014-0452),

[CVE-2014-0456](/security/CVE-2014-0456), [CVE-2014-0457](/security/CVE-2014-0457), [CVE-2014-0458](/security/CVE-2014-0458), [CVE-2014-0461](/security/CVE-2014-0461), [CVE-2014-0462](/security/CVE-2014-0462),

[CVE-2014-2397](/security/CVE-2014-2397), [CVE-2014-2405](/security/CVE-2014-2405), [CVE-2014-2412](/security/CVE-2014-2412), [CVE-2014-2414](/security/CVE-2014-2414), [CVE-2014-2421](/security/CVE-2014-2421),

[CVE-2014-2423](/security/CVE-2014-2423), [CVE-2014-2427](/security/CVE-2014-2427))

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to

information disclosure and data integrity. An attacker could exploit these

to expose sensitive data over the network. ([CVE-2014-0453](/security/CVE-2014-0453), [CVE-2014-0460](/security/CVE-2014-0460))

A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to availability.

An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2014-0459](/security/CVE-2014-0459))

Jakub Wilk discovered that the OpenJDK JRE incorrectly handled temporary

files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite

arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu, this should be

prevented by the Yama link restrictions. ([CVE-2014-1876](/security/CVE-2014-1876))

A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to data

integrity. ([CVE-2014-2398](/security/CVE-2014-2398))

A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information

disclosure. An attacker could exploit this to expose sensitive data over

the network. ([CVE-2014-2403](/security/CVE-2014-2403))

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, breakouts of the Java sandbox, information disclosure
or denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b31-1.13.3-1~deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b31-1.13.3-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b31-1.13.3-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b31-1.13.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
