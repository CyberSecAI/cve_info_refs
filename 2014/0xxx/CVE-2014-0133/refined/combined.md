Hello!

A bug in the experimental SPDY implementation in nginx was found, which
might allow an attacker to cause a heap memory buffer overflow in a
worker process by using a specially crafted request, potentially
resulting in arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-0133).

The problem affects nginx 1.3.15 - 1.5.11, compiled with the
ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default) and
without --with-debug configure option, if the "spdy" option of the
"listen" directive is used in a configuration file.

The problem is fixed in nginx 1.5.12, 1.4.7.

Patch for the problem can be found here:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2014.spdy2.txt>

Thanks to Lucas Molas, researcher at Programa STIC, Fundación Dr. Manuel
Sadosky, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
