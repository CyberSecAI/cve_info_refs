Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the experimental SPDY implementation of nginx.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*  Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of specially crafted SPDY requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*  Arbitrary code execution within the worker process is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
* Sending a specially crafted SPDY request to a vulnerable nginx server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable nginx instance.
* The server must be configured to use the `ngx_http_spdy_module` and the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive
* The nginx binary cannot be compiled with the `--with-debug` configuration option.

**Affected Versions:**
* nginx versions 1.3.15 through 1.5.11 are affected when compiled with the `ngx_http_spdy_module` module, and without the `--with-debug` configuration option and if the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive is used in the configuration file.

**Resolution:**
* Update to nginx versions 1.5.12, or 1.4.7.
* A patch is available at <http://nginx.org/download/patch.2014.spdy2.txt>.
