- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticator` in Spring Security does not check the length of the provided password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of password length validation in `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticator`. This allows authentication to succeed with an empty password if the underlying Active Directory allows anonymous binds.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass user authentication by providing an empty password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to an application that uses Spring Security with an improperly configured `ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticator` and an Active Directory allowing anonymous binds.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of a user that exists in the directory.
