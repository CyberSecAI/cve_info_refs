        "Memory Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of WebAuth requests at a high rate and leave them in an uncompleted state. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume all available memory on the device. This causes a watchdog process to restart the WLC, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) while the device reboots.",

        "Sending a high rate of WebAuth requests"
      ],
