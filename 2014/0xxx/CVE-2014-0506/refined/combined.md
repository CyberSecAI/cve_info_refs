## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-09,
listed in the References section.

Two flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content.
An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted SWF file
that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF content.
(CVE-2014-0506, CVE-2014-0507)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
information if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially crafted web
page. (CVE-2014-0508)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially
crafted web page. (CVE-2014-0509)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.350.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

# Adobe Flash Player: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201405-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Adobe Flash Player, the
worst of which could result in execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-plugins/adobe-flash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **11.2.202.356** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **11.2.202.356** |

### Background

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for the SWF file format, which is
commonly used to provide interactive websites.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Flash Player.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF
file using Adobe Flash Player, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able to bypass the Same
Origin Policy or read the clipboard via unspecified vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-plugins/adobe-flash-11.2.202.356"

```
