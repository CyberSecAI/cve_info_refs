# Starbucks fixes iOS app bugs

A new version has been released which no longer writes the user's personal information to a file that can be accessed by others who have the phone.
  ![larry-seltzer-thumb.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4a35498bf905b492421521c006fcefad39e66b04/2013/08/01/dcbfc85e-1174-11e4-9732-00505685119a/larry-seltzer-thumb.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Larry Seltzer, Contributor](/meet-the-team/larry-seltzer/)  Jan. 18, 2014 at 9:58 a.m. PT

                ![starbucks.logo](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/2014/10/04/3bfa742c-4bf1-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/starbucks-logo.jpg)

In response to the [reports that their iOS app was writing the user's username and password in clear text to the device](/article/the-starbucks-bug-not-as-awful-as-reported/), Starbucks has released [a new version — 2.6.2 — of that app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/starbucks/id331177714?mt=8).

Daniel Wood, the security researcher who found and reported the bug, has analyzed the new version and says that [the major security problems in it that he reported have been fixed](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jan/123). He does have one recommendation for the app, but it's not a major issue.

As both Wood and we noted, there has been much exaggerated reporting on this bug. Only the iOS version was ever vulnerable. The user's credit card information was never in the file or otherwise exposed, but the Starbucks card number and balance were. The Starbucks servers were never compromised. There was no vulnerability in the app that would allow an attacker to run malicious code. The vulnerability was not remotely-exploitable; an attacker would need physical access to the phone, and probably need to cable it to a computer to access the data.

Some reports described a PIN bypass method. This is a method for bypassing the Starbucks app PIN in order to get at the data, not a way to bypass the iOS PIN. All the PIN does is to prevent access to the application; it doesn't allow a user browsing the file system from accessing the file.

Our report also jumped to an incorrect conclusion: The app does not need to crash in order for a session.clslog file to be created. The Crashlytics code generated it automatically, prior to the new version, when the app was backgrounded, for example when the user pressed the lock button.

Wood also reports that the geolocation log file is still created, although the app no longer keeps a running list of coordinates, which would allow some tracking of the user's movements. In the new version the app stores only the last location where a customer has used their device. Wood recommends that Starbucks remove this from the file, but doesn't consider it a significant issue.

### Editorsâ Choice

From sunup to sundown, millions of caffeine-craving people descend on Starbucks to get their daily cup. Weâve had Starbucksâ super-handy app on our phones for ages, and itâs staying right there. We love using the Mobile Order & Pay feature in the app to customize our beverage before even setting foot inside the store.

### No complaints!

> Letâs not dwell on all the perks I missed out on before I downloaded the appâ¦BECAUSE ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WEâRE HERE NOW!! Currently, I canât think of any suggestions that could enhance our current experience within the StarBucks App (which is a great lol). I personally like how easy to use it is! One of my favorites is how you can view your past orders - you know. When your friend puts you on to some new crazy special drink and you canât remember what it is? Yeahâ¦me too! Being able to go back and look is super helpful especially because my sister is VERY specific about how she likes her drink lol. You can favorite your drinks with ur customizations which makes ordering again a lot easier! Browsing the menu is always clean, interactive and user friendly imo! Plusssss I love seeing messages on deals (bogo drinks for example) that I mightâve missed because let be honestâ¦ ya girl does not check her emails like she should BUT the app reminds me I havenât missed a beat! And lastly I appreciate seeing the diversity of the lovely staff at my local Starbucks! It really makes me happy! Thank you Starbucks!

### Meh. Just meh

> I have a love hate relationship with this app. Itâs so weird how much I hate it and also love it at the same time. let me explain, so basically Iâve had this app for a few years. The reason to love it I guess is it helps you save money, time, stress of ordering , tip demanding employees, and more. You donât have to go through the stress of ordering in person you can order online and customize your drink just the same as if you were to walk into the normal store, but the problem is it cost more to do a mobile order I donât see why though. they make it just the same the only difference is you pick it up, and you donât have to order it in person. But a nice thing about the online ordering is that you donât have employees constantly, shoving tip screens in your face and you can pay the normal amount without having to pay a $10 tip too. The annoying thing is though you can have a lot of stars saved up and have enough for a few free drinks, but Starbucks doesnât tell you when your Stars expire. They just expire. One day I had a lot of stars and was planning on getting a free drink, but when I opened the app, it turned out most of them had expired. Starbucks didnât give me a warning or anything. this led to public humiliation. The pros and cons of this app are quite extreme. but Starbucks, you could improve.

# The Starbucks bug: not as awful as reported

[UPDATE] The iOS app, and only the iOS app, stores user credentials in clear text in a crash log file. Beware rampant misreporting on this issue.
  ![larry-seltzer-thumb.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4a35498bf905b492421521c006fcefad39e66b04/2013/08/01/dcbfc85e-1174-11e4-9732-00505685119a/larry-seltzer-thumb.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Larry Seltzer, Contributor](/meet-the-team/larry-seltzer/)  Jan. 17, 2014 at 5:00 a.m. PT

On Monday, January 13, researcher [Daniel Wood reported on the Full-Disclosure mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jan/64) that the Starbucks iOS app was storing user credentials in clear text on the device.

[**UPDATE**: [Starbucks has released a fixed version of the app](/article/starbucks-fixes-ios-app-bugs/).]

Since then, in a display of hysteria all too common in the security business, news reports have jumped to a number of unjustified conclusions. I won't name any names, but you can find them easily on Google News. Stories have given the impression that all online access to Starbucks suffers from this bug; that the app was storing "mobile passwords"; that it was storing this information for retrieval when the user logged in, as with a cookie; and that it was done for convenience of the user and/or developer. None of these are true.

### Featured

The bug is a real and disturbing bug, but it's not critical. Here's what it is: Starbucks uses a 3rd party software component called [Crashlytics](http://try.crashlytics.com/), which collects and analyzes crash data from apps. The Starbucks iOS app writes (or wrote; perhaps they have fixed it already) the username and password, along with the OAuth token and OAuth signature for the user's account/device on the Starbucks service, to the Crashlytics session.clslog file, and writes them in clear, unencrypted text.

This is a bad thing: A malicious and sophisticated user who had physical possession of the phone could look at the file and then log in to the Starbucks site as the user from another device or computer. If the user had credit card information stored, the malicious user could buy things at Starbucks. The user can't get the credit card information because he can only see the last 4 digits of the number. So the thief could buy things until the account holder's account was drained; if the account was set to auto-reload, he could buy some more — at Starbucks.

In his F-D post, Wood includes a list of [iOS best practices from OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/IOS_Developer_Cheat_Sheet), the first of which is "Never store credentials on the phone file system." Starbucks knows this and, [as ComputerWorld reported](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245438/Evan_Schuman_Starbucks_caught_storing_mobile_passwords_in_clear_text_), they knew about this specific issue but had not yet done anything about it. Clearly embarrassing, and you can expect the Starbucks app developers to be drinking a lot of the company's product as they fix the problem ASAP, dropping all other priorities until it's done. In this case, the fix may be simple in that they just to not write the username and password to the log file. Incidentally, [here's Starbucks's public letter on the matter](http://news.starbucks.com/views/security-of-starbucks-mobile-app-for-ios).

Wood also later found that Starbucks was storing geolocation data for each time he asked the app to find a store. Computerworld quotes Wood as saying "If you grab someone's phone, you can effectively go through this log and see effectively where this person has been," but it wouldn't be a very complete log of your locations.

Starbucks confirmed for me that only the iOS app was at issue. Wood said he couldn't say more now than was already public, but that more information should be forthcoming soon.

Just to be sure, and out of curiosity, I scoured all the data from the Android app on a couple Android devices (it stores very little) and didn't see any cleartext credentials, nor were there in any of the cookies or other storage for starbucks.com in my web browser. **[UPDATE: An earlier version of this story stated that not all Starbucks iOS app users would have a session.clslog file because the app may not have crashed. As we say in [our story about the fixed app version](/article/starbucks-fixes-ios-app-bugs/), there are other ways that a user might have the file on their system.]**

I have received several pitches from security companies and analysts who want to talk to me about this issue, and every one of them exaggerated the threat. This is not uncommon, as the security industry has no interest in noting mitigating factors. It's always better for them if the public thinks things are as bad as possible. That's why you need to take a breath and think about security reports and what they actually say, and not assume anything else.

Updated Security Review for the new Starbucks v2.6.2 mobile iOS application

After publishing my vulnerability report on the Starbucks v2.6.1 mobile iOS application, I have been in continuous
communication with Starbucks.  As you know, Starbucks released an updated version of the application to address these
security concerns.  I have evaluated the latest version of the Starbucks mobile application (v2.6.2) from the Apple App
Store and conducted exhaustive retesting of the application in order to confirm whether the vulnerabilities were
successfully addressed.

Prior to starting the new version of the Starbucks mobile app, session.clslog was 64kb (varies on how many user actions
you took prior to capturing the data) in size.  After running the new version of the application, it clears the
session.clslog data file effectively removing all sensitive data elements that were being previously stored.

Caveats:
If you install the latest Starbucks 2.6.2 app update without actually running the application, the session.clslog file
remains with the sensitive data contained within it, however, as soon as you launch the new version of the application
it clears session.clslog out, effectively wiping this data off your device.   This behavior makes sense as the
application is required to run in order to execute the programmatic functions that address the issue of a static file
that was being spooled to.

There is still a file, located in /Starbucks/Library/Preferences/com.starbucks.mystarbucks.plist that contains
geolocation data of a users last logged geolocation.  The difference here is, it is not a running log of a customers
geolocation like was being stored in session.clslog.  This information is only the last location where a customer has
used their device.  As such, I do not believe this file is a security concern as it does not aggregate geolocation data
over time.  Your stored geolocation is overwritten each time and cannot be used to track your movement patterns over
time.

In summary, Starbucks has effectively addressed the security issues that were documented in my original report
published January 14, 2014, however, I do recommend that the above issue be remediated within the next release cycle of
the mobile application to prevent a customers' last logged geolocation data from being stored.

To address some misinformation that has been released:
The application does not need to crash in order for a customer's sensitive data elements to be written to
session.clslog - this happened automatically prior to v2.6.2 being released.  The application can be backgrounded and
the phone can be in Sleep mode by pressing the ‘Lock’ button on the top of the device and the data was written to
session.clslog.

During the initial testing of the application, at no point was there credit card data contained within this file, only
your Starbucks Card number and balance amount.  During my testing I opted not to enter a valid credit card due to
personal privacy precautions, thus the resulting entry within session.clslog had a value of <null>.

At no point were Starbucks's data servers compromised, exposing their 10 million customers to the application as some
reports have suggested.  This was a local exploitable vulnerability on a users device, not a remotely exploitable
vulnerability on their servers or any other type of remote code execution vulnerability.

The PIN bypass methods described by some outlets mention the device's PIN, in actuality it is the PIN within the
Starbucks application that did not prevent access to the sensitive user data elements being stored within
session.clslog.  While it is still possible to access application files stored on the device, since the v.2.6.2 update,
this is no longer an issue as these data elements are not being written to session.clslog in clear text as was the case
with the original vulnerability.  Keep in mind this is true for ANY application that uses a PIN to 'protect' your data.
 It is only as secure as how the data written to the device is being secured either through encryption or never saving
the data to disk to begin with.  A PIN only prevents someone from access the application itself, not the data being
stored.  If you don’t store any data or you encrypt it, you have nothing to worry about if done properly.  Application
sandboxing does not prevent this type of vulnerability if it is being written to the disk.

43440 $ -[AccountManager forgotPasswordEmail:withUserName:] line 1609 $ BODY STRING:[
{"emailAddress":"CLEARTEXT","userName":"CLEARTEXT"} ]

Note: All references of 'CLEARTEXT' above are the cleartext values of each referenced string.

Mitigation:
To prevent sensitive user data (credentials) from being recovered by a malicious user, output sanitization should be
conducted to prevent these data elements from being stored in the crashlytics log files in clear-text, if at all.

iOS Specific Best Practices (from OWASP Mobile Top 10 - M1 Insecure Data Storage):
- Never store credentials on the phone file system. Force the user to authenticate using a standard web or API login
scheme (over HTTPS) to the application upon each opening and ensure session timeouts are set at the bare minimum to
meet the user experience requirements.
- Where storage or caching of information is necessary consider using a standard iOS encryption library such as
CommonCrypto
- If the data is small, using the provided apple keychain API is recommended but, once a phone is jailbroken or
exploited the keychain can be easily read. This is in addition to the threat of a bruteforce on the devices PIN, which
as stated above is trivial in some cases.
- For databases consider using SQLcipher for Sqlite data encryption
- For items stored in the keychain leverage the most secure API designation, kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked (now the
default in iOS 5) and for enterprise managed mobile devices ensure a strong PIN is forced, alphanumeric, larger than 4
characters.
- For larger or more general types of consumer-grade data, Apple’s File Protection mechanism can safely be used (see
NSData Class Reference for protection options).
- Avoid using NSUserDefaults to store senstitve pieces of information as it stores data in plist files.
- Be aware that all data/entities using NSManagedObects will be stored in an unencrypted database file.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
