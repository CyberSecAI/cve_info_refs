Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-0647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Starbucks iOS app (version 2.6.1) was using a third-party software component called Crashlytics for crash data collection.  The app was incorrectly writing user credentials (username, email address, password), along with the OAuth token and signature, in clear text to the Crashlytics log file named "session.clslog".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Data Storage:** User credentials were being stored in clear text on the device's file system, violating a basic security principle.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** Sensitive data, including login credentials, was not encrypted before being written to the log file.
*   **Overly Permissive Logging:** The Crashlytics log file was capturing and storing sensitive user data elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker with physical access to the device could extract the cleartext credentials from the log file.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  The attacker could then use these credentials to access the user's Starbucks account on other devices or online, potentially making purchases or modifying the account.
*   **Financial Loss:** If credit card information was linked to the account, the attacker could make unauthorized purchases, although only the last 4 digits of the credit card were viewable in the app. The Starbucks card number and balance were exposed.
*   **Geolocation Tracking (Minor):** While not a primary impact, geolocation data was also stored, potentially allowing some tracking of user locations, although this was a limited and not a comprehensive log of the user's movements.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the user's iOS device.
*   **File System Access:**  The attacker needs to access the device's file system.  This may require connecting the device to a computer to access the data.
*   **Log File Extraction:** The attacker needs to be able to locate and extract the "session.clslog" file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the victim's iOS device.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker should have some technical knowledge to navigate the file system and extract the log file.
*   **Ability to Exploit Credentials:** The attacker needs the ability to use the extracted credentials to login into the user's account.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was specific to the iOS version of the Starbucks app; the Android app was not affected.
*   The issue was not related to a crash of the app. The logging of credentials to the file was triggered whenever the app was backgrounded or the phone was locked.
*   Starbucks released version 2.6.2 to address this vulnerability. The new version clears the session.clslog file upon launch and no longer stores credentials in cleartext. The geolocation log was also changed to only store the last location, rather than a running log.
