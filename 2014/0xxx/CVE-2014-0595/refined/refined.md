Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-0595

**Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds write issue in the `nwrights` utility of the Novell Client for Linux. This occurred when assigning "File Scan" rights ('F'), due to an incorrect bit being set outside of the array access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Incorrect rights assignment: When a user was granted 'File Scan' rights ('F'), the `nwrights` utility erroneously assigned 'Supervisor' rights ('S') as well.
- Out-of-bounds write: The root cause was an out-of-bounds write causing an extra bit to be set, leading to the elevation of privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Users granted the 'File Scan' right ('F') also inadvertently received the 'Supervisor' right ('S'), granting them more control than intended over the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by using the `nwrights` command-line utility, part of the Novell Client for Linux, to set the 'File Scan' right.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to use the `nwrights` utility on an affected system. This would typically require command-line access or the ability to execute commands as an authorized user.
- The attacker would need to be in a position to modify rights on the file system.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was present in the Novell Client for Linux as shipped with OES11 SP2, but not with the client shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3.
-  On OES11 SP1, the same vulnerability would cause a crash.
- A hot patch "April 2014 OES11SP2 Hot Patch for NCL" was released to fix the issue.

This vulnerability allowed for unintended privilege escalation by granting supervisor rights alongside file scan rights, which would allow a user to have excessive control over files.
