## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0457)

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import and
execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2014-0472)

It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django
application. (CVE-2014-0473)

It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not properly
perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when processed by a
Django application using a MySQL database, could have various
application-specific impacts on the MySQL database. (CVE-2014-0474)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Benjamin Bach as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0472, Paul McMillan as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0473, and
the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski, as the original
reporters of CVE-2014-0474.

All users of OpenStack Dashboard are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for
the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on April 21, 2014

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.11,
Django 1.5.6, Django 1.6.3 and Django 1.7 beta 2 -- as part of [our
security process](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/). These
releases are now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django) and our [download page](/download/).

These releases address an unexpected code-execution issue, a caching
issue which can expose CSRF tokens and a MySQL typecasting
issue. While these issues present limited risk and may not affect all
Django users, we encourage all users to evaluate their own risk and
upgrade as soon as possible.

For more details, read on.

#### Issue: Unexpected code execution using reverse()

Django's URL handling is based on a mapping of regex patterns
(representing the URLs) to callable views, and Django's own processing
consists of matching a requested URL against those patterns to
determine the appropriate view to invoke.

Django also provides a convenience function --
django.core.urlresolvers.reverse() -- which performs this process
in the opposite direction. The reverse() function takes
information about a view and returns a URL which would invoke that
view. Use of reverse() is encouraged for application developers,
as the output of reverse() is always based on the current URL
patterns, meaning developers do not need to change other code when
making changes to URLs.

One argument signature for reverse() is to pass a dotted Python
path to the desired view. In this situation, Django will import the
module indicated by that dotted path as part of generating the
resulting URL. If such a module has import-time side effects, those
side effects will occur.

Thus it is possible for an attacker to cause unexpected code
execution, given the following conditions:

1. One or more views are present which construct a URL based on user
   input (commonly, a "next" parameter in a querystring indicating
   where to redirect upon successful completion of an action).
2. One or more modules are known to an attacker to exist on the
   server's Python import path, which perform code execution with side
   effects on importing.

To remedy this, reverse() will now only accept and import dotted
paths based on the view-containing modules listed in the project's URL
pattern configuration, so as to ensure that only modules the developer
intended to be imported in this fashion can or will be imported.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0472.

Thanks to Benjamin Bach for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: Caching of anonymous pages could reveal CSRF token

Django includes both a caching framework and a system for preventing
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The CSRF-protection system
is based on a random nonce sent to the client in a cookie which must
be sent by the client on future requests and, in forms, a hidden value
which must be submitted back with the form.

The caching framework includes an option to cache responses to
anonymous (i.e., unauthenticated) clients.

When the first anonymous request to a given page is by a client which
did not have a CSRF cookie, the cache framework will also cache the
CSRF cookie and serve the same nonce to other anonymous clients who
do not have a CSRF cookie. This can allow an attacker to obtain a
valid CSRF cookie value and perform attacks which bypass the check for
the cookie.

To remedy this, the caching framework will no longer cache such
responses. The heuristic for this will be:

1. If the incoming request did not submit any cookies, and
2. If the response did send one or more cookies, and
3. If the Vary: Cookie header is set on the response, then the
   response will not be cached.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0473.

Thanks to committer Paul McMillan for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: MySQL typecasting

The MySQL database is known to "typecast" on certain queries; for
example, when querying a table which contains string values, but using
a query which filters based on an integer value, MySQL will first
silently coerce the strings to integers, and return a result based on
that.

If a query is performed without first converting values to the
appropriate type, this can produce unexpected results, similar to what
would occur if the query itself had been manipulated.

Django's model field classes are aware of their own types and most
such classes perform explicit conversion of query arguments to the
correct database-level type before querying. However, three model
field classes did not correctly convert their arguments:

* FilePathField
* GenericIPAddressField
* IPAddressField

These three fields have been updated to convert their arguments to the
correct types before querying.

Additionally, developers of custom model fields are now warned via
documentation to ensure their custom field classes will perform
appropriate type conversions, and users of the raw() and
extra() query methods -- which allow the developer to supply raw
SQL or SQL fragments -- will be advised to ensure they perform
appropriate manual type conversions prior to executing queries.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0474.

Thanks to the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski,
for providing information regarding this issue.

Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0472 CVE-2014-0473 CVE-2014-0474 CVE-2014-1418
                 CVE-2014-3730

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0472

    Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.

CVE-2014-0473

    Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.

CVE-2014-0474

    Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.

CVE-2014-1418

    Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
    private data or poison caches.

CVE-2014-3730

    Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
    use this to cause unexpected redirects.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0456)

## Topic

Updated Django packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Django web framework is used by horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import and
execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges of the
user running the application. (CVE-2014-0472)

It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django
application. (CVE-2014-0473)

It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not properly
perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when processed by a
Django application using a MySQL database, could have various
application-specific impacts on the MySQL database. (CVE-2014-0474)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Benjamin Bach as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0472, Paul McMillan as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0473, and
the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski, as the original
reporters of CVE-2014-0474.

All users of OpenStack Dashboard are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for
the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# USN-2169-1: Django vulnerabilities

22 April 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted Python

paths when using the reverse() function. An attacker could use this issue

to cause Django to import arbitrary modules from the Python path, resulting

in possible code execution. ([CVE-2014-0472](/security/CVE-2014-0472))

Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain pages that

contained CSRF cookies. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain

a valid cookie and perform attacks which bypass the CSRF restrictions.

([CVE-2014-0473](/security/CVE-2014-0473))

Michael Koziarski discovered that Django did not always perform explicit

conversion of certain fields when using a MySQL database. An attacker

could possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected results. ([CVE-2014-0474](/security/CVE-2014-0474))
