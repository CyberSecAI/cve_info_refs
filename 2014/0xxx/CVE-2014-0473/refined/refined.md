{
  "CVE-2014-0473": {
    "Description": "It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients. A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django application.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Django's caching framework incorrectly reuses CSRF nonces for unauthenticated clients.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF token reuse leading to potential bypass of CSRF protections.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can acquire a valid CSRF token and bypass CSRF protections, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.",
     "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this by making requests to pages that use Django's caching framework and CSRF protection, without initially sending a CSRF cookie. This allows the attacker to obtain the cached CSRF cookie.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable Django application and needs to understand how the application uses caching and CSRF protections."
