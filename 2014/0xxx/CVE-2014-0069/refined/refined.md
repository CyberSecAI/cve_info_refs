{
  "CVE-2014-0069": {
    "Description": "The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.",
    "Root cause": "The cifs_iovec_write function does not properly handle the scenario where the copy operation from user space using iov_iter_copy_from_user copies less data than requested due to invalid user pointers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of bogus user pointers passed via writev() during uncached writes.",
      "Lack of proper validation of the number of copied bytes when using iov_iter_copy_from_user."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged local user with access to a CIFS share can cause a denial of service (system crash) or leak kernel memory. Privilege escalation is possible but unlikely due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user with access to a CIFS share can exploit this via a crafted iovec structure passed to writev() during an uncached write operation.",
     "Required capabilities": "Local access to a system with a mounted CIFS share"
  }
