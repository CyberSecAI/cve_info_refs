## Analysis of CVE-2014-0590

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a "type confusion" error within Adobe Flash Player. The specific details of this type confusion are not given but it relates to how Flash Player handles data types internally.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is that the software mishandles the interpretation of data types. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unspecified Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered via "unspecified vectors". This means that the exact method of triggering the vulnerability is not publicly known or disclosed. This generally involves a crafted SWF file or malicious Flash content delivered over the network or through other means.
* **Network:** The attack vector is network based (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through network access (e.g., through a web browser).
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, which means any user who views malicious content could be affected (Au:N).
*   **Low Complexity:** The access complexity is low (AC:L), meaning exploitation is relatively easy.

**Affected Products:**

*   Adobe Flash Player on Windows, OS X, and Linux
    *   Before version 13.0.0.252
    *   14.x and 15.x before 15.0.0.223
    *   Linux before 11.2.202.418
*   Adobe AIR before 15.0.0.356
*   Adobe AIR SDK before 15.0.0.356
*   Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 15.0.0.356

**CVSS v2 Score:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 10, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C indicating a critical severity.
    *   AV:N (Network) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   AC:L (Low) - The attack is easily executable.
    *   Au:N (None) - No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   C:C (Complete) - The attacker can gain complete control of confidentiality.
    *   I:C (Complete) - The attacker can gain complete control of integrity.
    *   A:C (Complete) - The attacker can gain complete control of availability.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is distinct from other Flash Player vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-0577, CVE-2014-0584, CVE-2014-0585, and CVE-2014-0586).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in later versions of Adobe Flash Player.
*   SUSE has also released patches for this vulnerability for their affected products.
*   The provided text mentions this vulnerability is related to Bugzilla entry [905032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=905032).

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-0590 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player due to a type confusion error, allowing remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution without authentication. The vulnerability is network-exploitable, has a low attack complexity, and has the highest possible impact according to the CVSSv2 scale. Users of affected versions of Adobe Flash Player, AIR, and SDKs should update immediately.
