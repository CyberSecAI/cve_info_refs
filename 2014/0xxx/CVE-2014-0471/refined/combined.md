## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [dpkg](/security/cves?package=dpkg) - Debian package management system

## Details

Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg incorrectly certain paths and symlinks when

unpacking source packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked

into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could

modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of

service or potentially gaining access to the system.

Package        : dpkg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0471

Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg did not correctly parse C-style
filename quoting, allowing for paths to be traversed when unpacking a
source package - leading to the creation of files outside the directory
of the source being unpacked.

The update to the stable distribution (wheezy) incorporates
non-security changes that were targeted for the point release 7.5.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.9.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.13.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.17.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
