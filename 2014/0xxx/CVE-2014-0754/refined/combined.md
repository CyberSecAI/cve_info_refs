Vulnerability Details

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the basic authentication on the web server. Using
directory traversals an attacker can bypass the basic authentication mechanism in the web
server and gain unauthorized access to protected resources. This vulnerability would require
network access to the target device through TCP/IP and particularly HTTP.

These vulnerabilities were discovered during cyber security research both by an external
researcher and by Schneider Electric internal investigations. We have no evidence that these
vulnerabilities have been exploited.

Schneider Electric takes these vulnerabilities very seriously and we have devoted resources to
immediately investigate and address this issue. We believe it is critical to consider the whole
picture, including safety, security and reliability. Any patches/solutions/mitigations we release
will be carefully tested to ensure that they can be deployed in a manner that is both safe and
secure.

CVSS scores are a standard way of ranking vulnerabilities and are provided for reference based
on a typical control system, they should be adapted by individual users as required.

Overall CVSS Score: 9.3

For More Information

Schneider Electric has been designing industrial automation products for many years;
Schneider Electric follows, and recommends to its customers, industry best practices in the
development and implementation of control systems. This recommendation includes a Defense
in Depth approach to secure an Industrial Control System. This approach places the PLCs
behind one or more firewalls to restrict access to authorized personnel and protocols only. The
location of the firewalls is decided based on how large the trusted zone is required to be. Please

## OVERVIEW

Independent researcher Billy Rios has identified a directory traversal vulnerability in Schneider Electric’s SchneiderWEB, a web HMI. Schneider Electric has produced a firmware update that mitigates this vulnerability. Billy Rios has tested the update to validate that it resolves the vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

There are 22 affected products containing 66 affected part numbers. Please download [Schneider‑Electric Security Notification SEVD-14-260-01](http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2014-260-01) for the affected product details.

## IMPACT

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the basic authentication on the web server, which would allow unauthenticated administrative access and control over the device.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

## MITIGATION

Please see Schneider Electric’s vulnerability disclosure (SEVD-2014-260-01)Schneider Electric Vulnerability Disclosure – Modicon Ethernet Comm Modules - SEVD-2014-260-01 - http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p\_Doc\_Ref=SEVD-2014-260-01, web site last accessed September 30, 2014. for more detailed information on which product part numbers are affected, as well as the complete list of which devices have released firmware updates available.

This vulnerability disclosure can be downloaded at the following URL:

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/>

Search downloads for SEVD-14-260-01, then keyword SEVD-14-260-01 to download the vulnerability disclosure. This URL site can also be used to download firmware updates identified in the vulnerability disclosure.

Schneider Electric also recommends the following measures to mitigate the vulnerability for the remaining affected devices:

* Use a deep packet inspection firewall to prevent HTTP requests to the product that contains traversals in the URL.
* Disable Port 80 (HTTP) on modules where it is possible.
* Block Port 80 in firewalls to these devices, except for trusted devices.

Please contact Schneider Electric Customer Care Center for more information.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
