    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of Content-Type HTTP header for multipart requests leading to an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to improper parsing of HTTP headers",
      "Infinite loop in Apache Commons FileUpload due to a small buffer size"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network attack",
      "Maliciously crafted HTTP request with a malformed Content-Type header"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and craft a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request."
