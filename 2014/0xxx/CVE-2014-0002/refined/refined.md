    "description": "It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server and, potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.",
