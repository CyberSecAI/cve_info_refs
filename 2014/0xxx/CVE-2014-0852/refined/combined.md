How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Bulletin: SSL/TLS side channel timing vulnerability on WebSphere DataPower (CVE-2014-0852)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

DataPower appliances might be subject to side channel timing based attacks.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-0852](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0852)

**DESCRIPTION:**

## Affected Products and Versions

Products: WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances.

Versions: All versions through 4.0.2.15, 5.0.0.17, 6.0.0.9, 6.0.1.5. Note that versions 7.0.0.0 and higher are not affected by this vulnerability.

Hardware models: All platforms - 9004, 9005 and HS22 Blade. (9004 MTM - 9235-xxx; 9005 MTM - 7198 (1U) and 7199 (2U); HS22 - Integration Blade XI50B Type 4195)

Note that DataPower Virtual edition is not affected.

## Remediation/Fixes

Fix for 9005 and HS22 platforms are available in versions 5.0.0.16, 6.0.0.8, 6.0.1.4. You can also upgrade to version 7.0.0.0 or higher as they are not affected by this vulnerability.

Fix for 9004 platform is available in versions 5.0.0.16 and 6.0.0.8. Note that due to the hardware limitations of the 9004 platform (which has reached end-of-service), the fix might not completely prevent DataPower against timing based attacks, as there might still be a visible timing latency on the responses on 9004 platforms.

Refer to [APAR IT01111 for download links.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT01111) Customers using DataPower v4.0.2 on extended support, contact customer service.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Secure the LAN environment around DataPower appliances.

Monitor for suspicious activity around your network. Any illicit clients should be denied access to the network immediately.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Using side channel timing based analysis it might be possible to
  decrypt a secret SSL/TLS session key of a sniffed session of a
  DataPower device.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  DataPower appliances might be subject to side channel timing
  based attacks resulting in the decryption of an SSL/TLS secured
  transaction.  This can only occur if the attacker is on the same
  LAN network as the DataPower device.  The attacker has to send
  several million requests to DataPower and monitor the responses.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Fix is available in 5.0.0.16, 6.0.0.8, and 6.0.1.4.
