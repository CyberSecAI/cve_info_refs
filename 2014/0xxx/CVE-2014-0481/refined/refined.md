Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The vulnerability is caused by an inefficient algorithm used when handling file uploads with duplicate names. Django attempts to generate a unique filename by appending an underscore and an integer to the end of the filename (e.g., _1, _2, etc.) until a unique name is found.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Inefficient algorithm for generating unique filenames during file uploads, leading to an O(n) behavior where 'n' is the number of files with the same name.
Impact of exploitation:
    - A remote attacker can exploit this behavior by uploading multiple files with the same name, which causes a large number of `os.stat()` calls, leading to significant performance degradation and a denial of service.
Attack vectors:
    - Remote attacker uploads multiple files with the same name
Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to upload files to the Django application.
