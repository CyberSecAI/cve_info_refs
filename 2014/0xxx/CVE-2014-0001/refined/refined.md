  "CVE-2014-0001": {
    "Description": "The MySQL client in both MySQL and MariaDB contains a buffer overflow when reading the server version information.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow exists in the MySQL and MariaDB command-line client tool when processing excessively long server version strings.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
    "Impact": "A malicious or compromised database server, or a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, can potentially execute arbitrary code on the client system with the privileges of the user running the client. It could also crash the client application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Connecting to a malicious or compromised database server.",
       "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack."
       ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to either control the database server the client connects to or be positioned to intercept the traffic between the client and the legitimate server.",
    "Affected component": "MySQL and MariaDB command-line client tool (mysql)"
  }
