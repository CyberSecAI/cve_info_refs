Subject: CVE-2014-0155 -- kernel: kvm: BUG caused by invalid entry in guest
 ioapic redirection table

It was found that invalid entries in guest ioapic redirection table
could lead to BUG_ON in ioapic_deliver() function.

A privileged user in the guest could use this flaw to crash the host.

KVM: ioapic: fix assignment of ioapic->rtc\_status.pending\_eoi (CVE-2014-0155)QE reported that they got the BUG\_ON in ioapic\_service to trigger.
I cannot reproduce it, but there are two reasons why this could happen.
The less likely but also easiest one, is when kvm\_irq\_delivery\_to\_apic
does not deliver to any APIC and returns -1.
Because irqe.shorthand == 0, the kvm\_for\_each\_vcpu loop in that
function is never reached. However, you can target the similar loop in
kvm\_irq\_delivery\_to\_apic\_fast; just program a zero logical destination
address into the IOAPIC, or an out-of-range physical destination address.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1081589#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-27 16:06:34 UTC  ``` It was found that invalid entries in guest ioapic redirection table could lead to BUG_ON in ioapic_deliver() function.  A privileged user in the guest could use this flaw to crash the host.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1081589#c2)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-27 16:09:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.  This issue did not affect the versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 as they did not provide support for the KVM subsystem.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1081589#c3)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-07 14:26:01 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1085016](show_bug.cgi?id=1085016 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0155 kernel: kvm: BUG caused by invalid entry in guest ioapic redirection table [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1081589#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-07 14:26:50 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=5678de3f15010b9022ee45673f33bcfc71d47b60>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1081589#c5)  Fedora Update System    2014-04-18 15:36:16 UTC  ``` kernel-3.13.10-200.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
