# Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-14-261-01

## OVERVIEW

Researcher Ricardo Narvaja of Core Security Technologies has identified several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Advantech’s WebAccess application. Advantech has produced a patch that mitigates these vulnerabilities. The researcher has tested the patch to validate that it resolves the vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Advantech WebAccess versions are affected:

* WebAccess Version 7.2.

## IMPACT

An attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the target machine or crash the WebAccess application.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Advantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.

Advantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface product deployed across several sectors including Energy, Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Government Facilities. These systems are deployed globally.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

Crafting a working exploit for this vulnerability would be difficult. Social engineering is required to convince the user to open the malicious HTML file. This file could be located on the local machine or hosted on a web site controlled by the attacker. This decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.

## MITIGATION

Advantech has created a patch (AdvantechWebAccessUSANode\_20140730\_3.4.3.exe) that mitigates each of the vulnerabilities described above. Users may download the patch from the following location at Advantech’s web site:

<http://advantech.vo.llnwd.net/o35/www/webaccess/webaccess7.2/AdvantechWebAccessUSANode_20140730_3.4.3.exe>

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

In addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
2. Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email ScamsRecognizing and Avoiding Email Scams, http://www.us-cert.gov/reading\_room/emailscams\_0905.pdf, web site last accessed September 18, 2014.for more information on avoiding email scams.
3. Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing AttacksNational Cyber Alert System Cyber Security Tip ST04-014, http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html, web site last accessed September 18, 2014.for more information on social engineering attacks.
