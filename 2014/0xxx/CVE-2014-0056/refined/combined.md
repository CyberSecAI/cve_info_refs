# USN-2194-1: OpenStack Neutron vulnerability

5 May 2014

OpenStack Neutron would allow unintended access to other tenant networks.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [neutron](/security/cves?package=neutron) - Openstack Virtual Network Service

## Details

Aaron Rosen discovered that OpenStack Neutron did not properly perform

authorization checks when creating ports when using plugins relying on the

l3-agent. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to access the

network of other tenants.

### Reduce your security exposure

We should add more logic to only update the cache if needed. This is important as the periodic healer is always updating the cache. Note that this blueprint has no end user or documentation impact. | |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:0516 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-neutron security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0516)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix two security issues, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Networking performed authorization
checks on created ports. An authenticated user could potentially use this
flaw to create ports on a router belonging to a different tenant, allowing
unauthorized access to the network of other tenants. Note that only
OpenStack Networking setups using plug-ins that rely on the l3-agent were
affected. (CVE-2014-0056)

It was discovered that the default sudo configuration provided in OpenStack
Networking, which is specific to the openstack-neutron package shipped by
Red Hat, did not correctly specify a configuration file for rootwrap,
potentially allowing an unauthenticated user to escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2013-6433)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2014-0056. Upstream acknowledges Aaron Rosen from VMware as the
original reporter of CVE-2014-0056. The CVE-2013-6433 issue was discovered
by Kashyap Chamarthy of Red Hat.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
for these changes is available in the Technical Notes document linked to
in the References section.

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Message-ID: <1395935336.3723.23.camel@lappy>
Date: Fri, 28 Mar 2014 01:48:56 +1000
From: Grant Murphy <gmurphy@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: [OSSA 2014-008]  Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants
 (CVE-2014-0056)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-008
CVE: CVE-2014-0056
Date: March 27, 2014
Title: Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants
Reporter: Aaron Rosen (VMWare)
Products: Neutron
Affects: 2012.2 versions up to 2013.2.2

Description:
Aaron Rosen from VMWare reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails to
perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a
device id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an
authenticated user can access the network of other tenants. This affects
deployments of Neutron using plugins relying on the l3-agent.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/83391>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/83393>

Notes:
One should perform and audit of the ports that are already attached to
routers after applying this patch and remove ports that a tenant may
have cross plugged.

Mark, it looks (based on the backport patches) that we need Neutron series tasks for Grizzly and Havana added to the bug for tracking purposes, when you get a moment.

I reviewed the fix and confirmed it works as expected.

The change looks good (it is worth +2).

One minor nit on a comment.

I think it is better to change "a normal tenant" to "another tenant".

router is created by a default tenant ("test-tenant" is the default tenant is UT)

and 'tenant' tenant is a different tenant.

(Beyond this fix, it may be better to discuss who can specify/update device\_owner/device\_id? Now anyone can update device\_id/device\_owner of his/her ports, but it may be better only admin can specify them.)

Hi Akihiro,

Thanks for reviewing! On second thought I think that my patch does break/change a current behavior. Currently in neutron we support (or maybe not intentionally but ... but the api accepts it...) as the admin user can attach other tenants subnets to routers. With my patch this functionality no longer works for plugins using the L3 agent. I'm not sure we really want to support this type of thing though. We have this same issue all over though.

For example, as admin a tenant can attach another tenants security\_group to another tenants ports (thus that tenant won't be able to see the rules in the profile.) Same with floatingips.

I personally think we should remove this type of functionality though. I'm not sure there is a large use case for two different tenants to be connected to the same router (though I think others would probably disagree).

An alternative approach we can use to solve this problem is to not allow create/update\_port to be called with device\_owner=("network:router\_interface") in order to do this though we'll have to add another param to create/update\_port to account for when the create port call comes from router-interface-add.

What are you thoughts?

Hi Aaron,

Ah.. Good catch. I agree that we need to use another approach. I am not sure there is a case where multiple tenants connects to one router too.

Your alternative approach to not allow create/update\_port to be called with device\_owner router\_interface sounds reasonable.

In general device\_id and device\_owner attributes of ports created by Neutron internally should not be specified by a regular user. I think it is no problem admin user can specify device\_owner router\_interface.

An approach in my mind is a bit different from your original one. It is to not allow create/update\_port with device\_owner router\_interface \*\*for normal users.\*\* In this approach we can use elevated context for create\_port from router-interface-add and an additional parameter is unnecessary.

Thought?

we can add a way to do verification. for example, we can add a hook registry on port update and creation according to field and operation type.

L3 service plugin should add a hook into the registry. the device\_owner and device\_id hook will call the hook, which will do the verification.

Hi Akihiro

I took your approach of using context.elevated() thus this will still work for admin users. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Aaron

Thanks Aaron for the updated patch.

-1 from me.

Checking device\_owner works as expected, but we need to check device\_id too. I tested the following scenario and succeeded a router interface to admin router with demo tenant. In this scenario a regular tenant (demo) first adds a router interface to its router and then changes device\_id of the router interface to a router of another tenant (admin).

I think we need to check if a tenant can access a router with a specified device\_id (= router\_id) if (new) device\_owner is network:router\_interface unless a tenant is admin.

[admin tenant]

neutron net-create admin-net1

neutron subnet-create --name admin-subnet1 admin-net1 10.2.2.0/24

neutron router-create admin-router

# make sure to schedule router to l3-agent

neutron router-interface-add admin-router admin-subnet1

[demo tenant]

neutron net-create net1

neutron subnet-create --name subnet1 net1 10.1.1.0/24

neutron router-interface-add router1 subnet1

# Change device\_id of the above router interface to admin\_router

neutron port-update <port-id of router1 interface> --device\_id <admin-router ID>

After restarting l3-agent, I saw an interface corresponding to the router interface from demo tenant in admin-router namespace.

add device\_id and device\_owner check func

This patch provides an unified way to validate the device owner and

    device id to avoid cross plugging ports from other tenants.

This patch just provides router interface check, but VIP, even

    nova instance owner can be easily implemented.

Draft impact description.

----

Title: Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants

Reporter: Aaron Rosen (VMWare)

Products: Neutron

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Aaron Rosen from VMWare reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails

to perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By

choosing a device id of a router from a different tenant when

creating a port, an authenticated user can access the network

of other tenants. This affects all supported versions of Neutron.

@Grant: as per Aaron's commit message, the only Neutron deployments affected by this vulnerability are the ones that use plugins which rely on the the l3-agent. I'll give a look at the patch once more to confirm the patch addresses the issue without side effects.

I might also add Aaron's note (below) in the OSSA -

One should perform and audit of the ports that are already

       attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports

       that a tenant may have cross plugged.

If others are happy with that impact description I'll get a CVE assigned.

Grant's latest proposed impact description in comment #30 looks good. Also, I agree on adding the note in the OSSA (though of course it's not needed for the CVE request text).

After talking with Mark McClain and Aaron Rosen on irc, I have learned that there was a call with Mark, Aaron and Salvatore where this bug was discussed and a better permanent solution was agreed upon. Aaron remembers the conversation and has not had the time to put it into code as of yet.

He told me that he is putting some time aside this week to address this bug. Thank you, Aaron.

@Aaron, thanks for the patch. The patch itself works.

One question: The patch checks there is a router with specified device\_id and we can set non-existing UUID.

Even though the possibility is very very low, if other tenant creates a router with that UUID, the port is connected to the router. The possibility completely depends on randomness of UUID. It is different from the original case. The original case reports in this bug is if someone can know UUID of other tenant routers, he/she can connect a port to other tenant's router. I am not sure we should cover the case I mentioned here in this bug report, but it is worth considered once.

The below is minor suggestions to improve the codes.

----

+class DeviceIDNotOwnedByTenant(Conflict):

+ message = \_("The following device\_id %(device\_id)s is not owned by your "

+ "tenant or matches another tenants router.")

I think this exception is generic and not specific to "router".

How about passing "router" as a parameter.

message = \_("...... matches another tenants %(resource)s.")

-----

update\_port()

- "new\_device\_owner" looks better than "current\_device\_owner" because a device\_owner is not updated yet. IMO new and prev/old prefix looks better in update operation. "current\_" is a bit ambiguous.

- changed\_device\_id is set to True when 'device\_id' is not specified in update\_port. This means if device\_id is not specified in update\_port changed\_device\_id would be set to True.

----

\_enforce\_device\_owner\_not\_router\_intf\_or\_device\_id

- get\_service\_plugins() handles a case where core plugin supports L3. We can write it as follows:

if device\_id:

    l3\_plugin = (

        manager.NeturonManager.get\_service\_plugins().get(

            service\_constants.L3\_ROUTER\_NAT))

    if l3\_plugin:

        try:

            ctx\_admin = ctx.get\_admin\_context()

            router = l3plugin.get\_router(ctx\_admin, device\_id)

        except l3.RouterNotFound:

            return

    else:

        # raise as extension doesn't support L3 anyways.

        raise n\_exc.DeviceIDNotOwnedByTenant(....)

All my comments can be clean up in later patch.

My question is just talking about the possibility and it does not practically happen.

Thanks guys,

@Akihiro - Right it's possible for a router to be created that matches the uuid of another tenants router later down the road. That said this is pretty much impossible to occur though I think we should probably address this anyways after we merge this. I thought about this case and the reason I didn't address it here is we would need something that would regenerate uuid's on routers if there was a conflict similar to mac\_addresses (which isn't possible today as some backends generate their uuid's themselves).

Ship it!

Gmurphy will take the next steps and coordinate the release of this patch according to the steps found here: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management>

When it is time for disclosure of the patch, core members need to be available to review/approve it.

Thanks to all for their attention to this matter.

I think it's safe to omit the grizzly patch from the pre-OSSA and advisory. The VMT was supposed to stop considering new stable/grizzly backports after I-3 (which was a couple weeks ago, March 6).

Oh, I guess a stable/grizzly backport for this got included in the pre-OSSA, but I suppose we could still leave it out of the official advisory.

Prevent cross plugging router ports from other tenants

Previously, a tenant could plug an interface into another tenant's

    router if he knew their router\_id by creating a port with the correct

    device\_id and device\_owner. This patch prevents this from occuring

    by preventing non-admin users from creating ports with device\_owner

    network:router\_interface with a device\_id that matches another tenants router.

    In addition, it prevents one from updating a ports device\_owner and device\_id

    so that the device\_id won't match another tenants router with device\_owner

    being network:router\_interface.

NOTE: with this change it does open up the possiblity for a tenant to discover

    router\_id's of another tenant's by guessing them and updating a port till

    a conflict occurs. That said, randomly guessing the router id would be hard

    and in theory should not matter if exposed. We also need to allow a tenant

    to update the device\_id on network:router\_interface ports as this would be

    used for by anyone using a vm as a service router. This issue will be fixed in

    another patch upstream as a db migration is required but since this needs

    to be backported to all stable branches this is not possible.

NOTE: The only plugins affect by this are the ones that use the l3-agent.

NOTE: \*\*One should perform and audit of the ports that are already

            attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports

            that a tenant may have cross plugged.\*\*

commit 89025a8dd93918ac2967726ec7bb8ee5aa22d924

Author: armando-migliaccio <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Feb 5 16:27:52 2015 -0800

Fix lack of device ownership enforcement for DVR routers

The enforcement rule was applied to centralized router interfaces, to avoid

    a potential security vulnerabilty.

Even though DVR routers are fundamentally different from centralized routers,

    there is no good reason as to why the rule should be skipped for DVR interfaces.

This patch sanitizes the insanity a bit and closes this potential loophole by

    preventing the operation for DVR routers too.

Mark, it looks (based on the backport patches) that we need Neutron series tasks for Grizzly and Havana added to the bug for tracking purposes, when you get a moment.

I reviewed the fix and confirmed it works as expected.

The change looks good (it is worth +2).

One minor nit on a comment.

I think it is better to change "a normal tenant" to "another tenant".

router is created by a default tenant ("test-tenant" is the default tenant is UT)

and 'tenant' tenant is a different tenant.

(Beyond this fix, it may be better to discuss who can specify/update device\_owner/device\_id? Now anyone can update device\_id/device\_owner of his/her ports, but it may be better only admin can specify them.)

Hi Akihiro,

Thanks for reviewing! On second thought I think that my patch does break/change a current behavior. Currently in neutron we support (or maybe not intentionally but ... but the api accepts it...) as the admin user can attach other tenants subnets to routers. With my patch this functionality no longer works for plugins using the L3 agent. I'm not sure we really want to support this type of thing though. We have this same issue all over though.

For example, as admin a tenant can attach another tenants security\_group to another tenants ports (thus that tenant won't be able to see the rules in the profile.) Same with floatingips.

I personally think we should remove this type of functionality though. I'm not sure there is a large use case for two different tenants to be connected to the same router (though I think others would probably disagree).

An alternative approach we can use to solve this problem is to not allow create/update\_port to be called with device\_owner=("network:router\_interface") in order to do this though we'll have to add another param to create/update\_port to account for when the create port call comes from router-interface-add.

What are you thoughts?

Hi Aaron,

Ah.. Good catch. I agree that we need to use another approach. I am not sure there is a case where multiple tenants connects to one router too.

Your alternative approach to not allow create/update\_port to be called with device\_owner router\_interface sounds reasonable.

In general device\_id and device\_owner attributes of ports created by Neutron internally should not be specified by a regular user. I think it is no problem admin user can specify device\_owner router\_interface.

An approach in my mind is a bit different from your original one. It is to not allow create/update\_port with device\_owner router\_interface \*\*for normal users.\*\* In this approach we can use elevated context for create\_port from router-interface-add and an additional parameter is unnecessary.

Thought?

we can add a way to do verification. for example, we can add a hook registry on port update and creation according to field and operation type.

L3 service plugin should add a hook into the registry. the device\_owner and device\_id hook will call the hook, which will do the verification.

@ttx As Aaron's comment #9 says, the first approach has a problem, so I remove my +2. We need another patch.

Hi Akihiro

I took your approach of using context.elevated() thus this will still work for admin users. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Aaron

Thanks Aaron for the updated patch.

-1 from me.

Checking device\_owner works as expected, but we need to check device\_id too. I tested the following scenario and succeeded a router interface to admin router with demo tenant. In this scenario a regular tenant (demo) first adds a router interface to its router and then changes device\_id of the router interface to a router of another tenant (admin).

I think we need to check if a tenant can access a router with a specified device\_id (= router\_id) if (new) device\_owner is network:router\_interface unless a tenant is admin.

[admin tenant]

neutron net-create admin-net1

neutron subnet-create --name admin-subnet1 admin-net1 10.2.2.0/24

neutron router-create admin-router

# make sure to schedule router to l3-agent

neutron router-interface-add admin-router admin-subnet1

[demo tenant]

neutron net-create net1

neutron subnet-create --name subnet1 net1 10.1.1.0/24

neutron router-interface-add router1 subnet1

# Change device\_id of the above router interface to admin\_router

neutron port-update <port-id of router1 interface> --device\_id <admin-router ID>

After restarting l3-agent, I saw an interface corresponding to the router interface from demo tenant in admin-router namespace.

add device\_id and device\_owner check func

This patch provides an unified way to validate the device owner and

    device id to avoid cross plugging ports from other tenants.

This patch just provides router interface check, but VIP, even

    nova instance owner can be easily implemented.

Draft impact description.

----

Title: Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants

Reporter: Aaron Rosen (VMWare)

Products: Neutron

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Aaron Rosen from VMWare reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails

to perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By

choosing a device id of a router from a different tenant when

creating a port, an authenticated user can access the network

of other tenants. This affects all supported versions of Neutron.

I might also add Aaron's note (below) in the OSSA -

One should perform and audit of the ports that are already

       attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports

       that a tenant may have cross plugged.

If others are happy with that impact description I'll get a CVE assigned.

After talking with Mark McClain and Aaron Rosen on irc, I have learned that there was a call with Mark, Aaron and Salvatore where this bug was discussed and a better permanent solution was agreed upon. Aaron remembers the conversation and has not had the time to put it into code as of yet.

He told me that he is putting some time aside this week to address this bug. Thank you, Aaron.

@Aaron, thanks for the patch. The patch itself works.

One question: The patch checks there is a router with specified device\_id and we can set non-existing UUID.

Even though the possibility is very very low, if other tenant creates a router with that UUID, the port is connected to the router. The possibility completely depends on randomness of UUID. It is different from the original case. The original case reports in this bug is if someone can know UUID of other tenant routers, he/she can connect a port to other tenant's router. I am not sure we should cover the case I mentioned here in this bug report, but it is worth considered once.

The below is minor suggestions to improve the codes.

----

+class DeviceIDNotOwnedByTenant(Conflict):

+ message = \_("The following device\_id %(device\_id)s is not owned by your "

+ "tenant or matches another tenants router.")

I think this exception is generic and not specific to "router".

How about passing "router" as a parameter.

message = \_("...... matches another tenants %(resource)s.")

-----

update\_port()

- "new\_device\_owner" looks better than "current\_device\_owner" because a device\_owner is not updated yet. IMO new and prev/old prefix looks better in update operation. "current\_" is a bit ambiguous.

- changed\_device\_id is set to True when 'device\_id' is not specified in update\_port. This means if device\_id is not specified in update\_port changed\_device\_id would be set to True.

----

\_enforce\_device\_owner\_not\_router\_intf\_or\_device\_id

- get\_service\_plugins() handles a case where core plugin supports L3. We can write it as follows:

if device\_id:

    l3\_plugin = (

        manager.NeturonManager.get\_service\_plugins().get(

            service\_constants.L3\_ROUTER\_NAT))

    if l3\_plugin:

        try:

            ctx\_admin = ctx.get\_admin\_context()

            router = l3plugin.get\_router(ctx\_admin, device\_id)

        except l3.RouterNotFound:

            return

    else:

        # raise as extension doesn't support L3 anyways.

        raise n\_exc.DeviceIDNotOwnedByTenant(....)

All my comments can be clean up in later patch.

My question is just talking about the possibility and it does not practically happen.

Thanks guys,

@Akihiro - Right it's possible for a router to be created that matches the uuid of another tenants router later down the road. That said this is pretty much impossible to occur though I think we should probably address this anyways after we merge this. I thought about this case and the reason I didn't address it here is we would need something that would regenerate uuid's on routers if there was a conflict similar to mac\_addresses (which isn't possible today as some backends generate their uuid's themselves).

Ship it!

I think it's safe to omit the grizzly patch from the pre-OSSA and advisory. The VMT was supposed to stop considering new stable/grizzly backports after I-3 (which was a couple weeks ago, March 6).

Oh, I guess a stable/grizzly backport for this got included in the pre-OSSA, but I suppose we could still leave it out of the official advisory.

Prevent cross plugging router ports from other tenants

Previously, a tenant could plug an interface into another tenant's

    router if he knew their router\_id by creating a port with the correct

    device\_id and device\_owner. This patch prevents this from occuring

    by preventing non-admin users from creating ports with device\_owner

    network:router\_interface with a device\_id that matches another tenants router.

    In addition, it prevents one from updating a ports device\_owner and device\_id

    so that the device\_id won't match another tenants router with device\_owner

    being network:router\_interface.

NOTE: with this change it does open up the possiblity for a tenant to discover

    router\_id's of another tenant's by guessing them and updating a port till

    a conflict occurs. That said, randomly guessing the router id would be hard

    and in theory should not matter if exposed. We also need to allow a tenant

    to update the device\_id on network:router\_interface ports as this would be

    used for by anyone using a vm as a service router. This issue will be fixed in

    another patch upstream as a db migration is required but since this needs

    to be backported to all stable branches this is not possible.

NOTE: The only plugins affect by this are the ones that use the l3-agent.

NOTE: \*\*One should perform and audit of the ports that are already

            attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports

            that a tenant may have cross plugged.\*\*

Previously, a tenant could plug an interface into another tenant's
router if he knew their router\_id by creating a port with the correct
device\_id and device\_owner. This patch prevents this from occuring
by preventing non-admin users from creating ports with device\_owner
network:router\_interface with a device\_id that matches another tenants router.
In addition, it prevents one from updating a ports device\_owner and device\_id
so that the device\_id won't match another tenants router with device\_owner
being network:router\_interface.
NOTE: with this change it does open up the possiblity for a tenant to discover
router\_id's of another tenant's by guessing them and updating a port till
a conflict occurs. That said, randomly guessing the router id would be hard
and in theory should not matter if exposed. We also need to allow a tenant
to update the device\_id on network:router\_interface ports as this would be
used for by anyone using a vm as a service router. This issue will be fixed in
another patch upstream as a db migration is required but since this needs
to be backported to all stable branches this is not possible.
NOTE: The only plugins affect by this are the ones that use the l3-agent.
NOTE: \*\*One should perform and audit of the ports that are already
attached to routers after applying this patch and remove ports
that a tenant may have cross plugged.\*\*

Fix lack of device ownership enforcement for DVR routers

The enforcement rule was applied to centralized router interfaces, to avoid

    a potential security vulnerabilty.

Even though DVR routers are fundamentally different from centralized routers,

    there is no good reason as to why the rule should be skipped for DVR interfaces.

This patch sanitizes the insanity a bit and closes this potential loophole by

    preventing the operation for DVR routers too.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1063141#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-10 06:28:55 UTC  ``` The OpenStack project reports:  Title: Routers can be cross plugged by other tenants Reporter: Aaron Rosen (VMWare) Products: Neutron Affects: 2012.2 versions up to 2013.2.2  Description: Aaron Rosen from VMWare reported a vulnerability where Neutron fails to perform proper authorization checks when creating ports. By choosing a device id of a router from a different tenant when creating a port, an authenticated user can access the network of other tenants. This affects deployments of Neutron using plugins relying on the l3-agent.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1063141#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-10 06:29:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
