# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

{{$NEXT}}
1.913 2023-01-09 19:41:25-05:00 America/New\_York - as ever, you should probably use Email::Address::XS instead - this version now requires Perl v5.12 - some small tweaks to the code to take advantage of v5.12 made - update distribution metadata
1.912 2018-12-31 13:46:22-05:00 America/New\_York - include the doc updates from 1.911 changelog, oops!
1.911 2018-12-22 11:30:28-05:00 America/New\_York - just like 1.910, but with doc updates and undeprecation by Jim Brandt
1.910 2018-12-17 21:27:28-05:00 America/New\_York (TRIAL RELEASE) - update parsing to mitigate pathological cases (thanks, sunnavy!)
1.909 2018-03-04 22:07:12-05:00 America/New\_York - add some docs saying "don't use this, it can be busted"
1.908 2015-09-19 22:53:38-04:00 America/New\_York - default to 1 level of nested comments to avoid pathological behaviors
1.907 2015-02-03 17:48:10-05:00 America/New\_York - restore 5.8.x compatibility
1.906 2015-02-03 16:48:11-05:00 America/New\_York - the test suite tests parses more directly, which eliminates a number of misleading (and possibly wrong) test cases - escaped characters in a quoted string are now properly unescaped for the ->phrase method, which means things should round trip better from their decomposed form
1.905 2014-06-17 22:55:00-04:00 America/New\_York - additional change to avoid slowdown; this addresses CVE-2014-0477 change provided by Bastian Blank <waldi@debian.org>
1.904 2014-06-14 00:21:21-04:00 America/New\_York (TRIAL RELEASE) - avoid being fooled by an addr-like string in the phrase - avoid a slowdown by avoiding backtracking into the phrase
1.903 2014-04-17 21:02:14-04:00 America/New\_York - correctly parenthesize false comment "0" (sigh)
1.902 2014-04-17 10:45:11-04:00 America/New\_York - when formatting an address where phrase is empty but comment is not, do not include "" for the phrase; just omit it - when formatting and address where comment lacks enclosing parens, add them
1.901 2014-01-28 22:41:54-05:00 America/New\_York further avoidance of stringifying to undef (thanks, this time, to David Golden)
1.900 2013-08-08 14:44:43 America/New\_York avoid trying to stringify undef, and so avoid a warning (thanks, Alex Vandiver)
1.899 2013-08-02 10:53:19 America/New\_York repackaged, pointed at new bugtracker
 fallback overloads are enabled, so "cmp" will now compare with string overloads... which still might not be what you expect
 code has been futzed with to rely on some 5.6-isms, rather than trying to be 5.005 compatible
 a warning has been added: calling ->parse in scalar context gets undefined behavior
1.898 2013-02-07 remove dead link
1.897 2012-12-17 skip mailboxes, rather than aborting the whole parse, when encountering non-ASCII characters (thanks, Ruslan Zakirov!)
 improve the behavior of escaping in phrases (thanks, Ruslan Zakirov!)
1.896 2012-07-31 documentation improvements (thanks, Glenn Fowler!)
1.895 2012-01-15 allow non-ASCII \*only in phrase\*
1.894 2012-01-14 note that the use of the regex vars is not a great idea
1.893 2012-01-02 reject any non-ascii content in strings
1.892 2010-09-02 revert all behavior to 1.889
1.891 2010-08-30 rework domainless address feature to work on perl5.8 (Alex Vandiver)
1.890 2010-08-22 allow domainless addresses (if requested) (thanks, Alex Vandiver)
1.889 2007-12-19 even if the phrase needed quoting, do not return quoted phrase from the phrase method
1.888 2007-04-01 rt 16320 - collapse multiple whitespaces to prevent speed problem rt 24161 - forbid backslash in dot-atom
1.887 2007-04-01 fix a test to prevent failure on 5.005
1.886 2007-03-01 fix stupid use/require bug in test
1.885 2007-02-28 do not quote the phrase if it's MIME encoded do not double quote the phrase thanks to MIYAGAWA and KEVINR for tests for the above!
1.884 2006-12-04 fix phrase-quoting behavior by always quoting the phrase, if given this fixes bug 13387; thanks, Dave Rolsky!
1.883 2006-11-25 resolve bug 23565, as\_string didn't work on 5.8.0 (weird!) improve skip behavior for cache-cow.t with older Scalar::Util restore as\_string issue deprecation warning if $STRINGIFY is changed
1.882 2006-11-22 fix bug 21270, do not allow changes to objects to pollute the cache packaging improvements make test suite easier to manage improve honesty of documentation (we are not complete, (yet))
1.881 2006-11-20 Basically: fixes a case where regex never returns. resolve bug 23187 by slighly diluting the solution to 22991, which is a more marginal problem than that of 23187, in practical terms
1.880 2006-11-11 resolve bug 22991, support obs-phrase construct this creates a significant slowdown, sadly, but nothing to rival bug 16320
1.871 2006-10-121.870 2006-08-10 restore as\_string issue deprecation warning if $STRINGIFY is changed
1.86 2006-07-21 update docs tweak regex for approximate 50% performance boost ...but bug 16320 is still true: Email::Address can be VERY slow https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16320
1.85 2006-07-07 add disable\_cache and enable\_cache methods (bug 19163, thanks ADAMK)
1.80 2004-10-22 With long mal-formed comment structures, backtracking was causing parse() to "hang." This was tracked down and fixed. (Tim O'Brien reported this).
1.7 2004-10-12 $comment was initialized twice, oops. Lowered the default nested comment level from five to two, cut regex in half.
1.6 2004-10-05 Only define package variables if they haven't already been defined.
1.5 2004-10-05 Implemented the remainder of the spec for CFWS. This was intentionally left out of previous versions because it increases the size of the regex ten fold. I was surprised to learn that the slowdown was only 33%, leaving Email-Address faster than its competition by a factor of two in the benchmarks I've created (which makes them subjective, I suppose).
1.3 2004-08-15 name() was incorrectly fixing up a comment.
1.2 2004-06-02 Added original() method. Allowed access to key regexes.
1.1 2004-05-26 Initial version.

Package        : libemail-address-perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0477

Bastian Blank reported a denial of service vulnerability in
Email::Address, a Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and creation.
Email::Address::parse used significant time on parsing empty quoted
strings. A remote attacker able to supply specifically crafted input to
an application using Email::Address for parsing, could use this flaw to
mount a denial of service attack against the application.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.895-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.905-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.905-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libemail-address-perl packages.

Hi

Bastian Blank reported a denial of service vulnerability in
Email::Address, a Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and
creation[1]. Email::Address::parse uses significant time on parsing
empty quoted string, as allowed by RFC 2822.

CVE-2014-0477 was assigned to reference this issue.

Bastian Blank suggested a fix which was applied upstream as [2]
contained in a new upstream version 1.905[3] which contain additional
commits to avoid slowdowns.
