Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-0477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Email::Address::parse` function of the `Email::Address` Perl module. It was discovered that the parser could take a significant amount of time to parse empty quoted strings, as allowed by RFC 2822. This inefficient parsing could be exploited to cause a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a DoS due to inefficient parsing of specific input. Specifically, the parser exhibits significant slowdown when handling empty quoted strings within email addresses.
- **Inefficient Regex:** The regular expression used for parsing quoted strings (`$quoted_string`) was vulnerable to backtracking when encountering empty quoted strings, leading to excessive processing time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending crafted email addresses with empty quoted strings to applications utilizing the vulnerable `Email::Address` module. This would lead to excessive processing, resource exhaustion and potentially crashing the affected applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** The attack vector is through specifically crafted input strings (email addresses) containing empty quoted strings.
- **Remote Exploitation:** A remote attacker could trigger this vulnerability by submitting these crafted addresses to applications that use the vulnerable Email::Address module for parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input to an affected application:** The attacker needs to be in a position to provide email addresses to applications that use the `Email::Address` module for parsing. This could be via web forms, email submission, or any other channel where the application processes email addresses using the vulnerable library.
- **No privilege requirements:** No special privileges are needed to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.905 of the `Email::Address` module, which was released on June 17, 2014.
- The fix involved modifying the regex for quoted strings to avoid the excessive backtracking, resolving the denial of service condition.
-  The specific code change that addresses the vulnerability is changing the regex from `my $quoted_string = qr/$cfws\*"$qcontent+"$cfws\*/;` to `my $quoted_string = qr/$cfws\*"$qcontent\*"$cfws\*/;` in `lib/Email/Address.pm`.
- Red Hat has rated the security impact of this issue as low and does not plan to address it in future updates, however, they backported the fix to older releases.
- Debian also released a security advisory (DSA-2969-1) for this vulnerability.
- The issue was initially reported by Bastian Blank.
