## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Steve Holme discovered that libcurl incorrectly reused wrong connections

when using protocols other than HTTP and FTP. This could lead to the use of

unintended credentials, possibly exposing sensitive information.

([CVE-2014-0138](/security/CVE-2014-0138))

Richard Moore discovered that libcurl incorrectly validated wildcard SSL

certificates that contain literal IP addresses. An attacker could possibly

exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2014-0139](/security/CVE-2014-0139))

# Chef Server 11.0.12 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Chef Server 11.0.12 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Chef Server should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server â usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be understated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Chef Server install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Chef Server, visit <https://www.getchef.com/chef/install>

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_open_source.html#upgrade-to-newer-versions-of-chef-server-11>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE â** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/open_source/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets â** While your Chef Server install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Chef Server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasnât encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client â** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you donât have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Security Fixes

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Chef Server 11.0.11:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0138 CVE-2014-0139
Debian Bug     : 742728

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2014-0138

    Steve Holme discovered that libcurl can in some circumstances re-use
    the wrong connection when asked to do transfers using other
    protocols than HTTP and FTP.

CVE-2014-0139

    Richard Moore from Westpoint Ltd. reported that libcurl does not
    behave compliant to RFC 2828 under certain conditions and
    incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal
    IP addresses.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze8.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy9.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server â usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE â** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets â** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasnât encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client â** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you donât have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Bug Fixes:

The following bug fixes have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [private-chef-cookbooks] Provide default value for jetty log path to fix dotfile deletion bug.
* [private-chef-ctl] private-chef-ctl password fixed to work correctly after a regression introduced in EC 1.4.6.
* [private-chef-cookbooks] Manage /var/log/opscode permissions even with non 0022 umask.

### Security Fixes:

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [opscode-webui] Incorporate patches to address several identified potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities in the Rails framework.
* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)
* [libcurl] Patch for address wildcard certificate validation (CVE-2014-0139)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl (CVE-2014-1563)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Winssl (CVE-2014-2522)
* [openssl] Patch for heartbeat extension exposing process memory (CVE-2014-0160)

# Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server â usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>
  + **WARNING â** take special care to note the known issues with HA upgrades: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha_notes.html#known-issues>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE â** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets â** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasnât encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client â** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you donât have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      service.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
