## Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions' 4690 Point of Sale operating system contains a password hashing algorithm that can be reversed

#### Vulnerability Note VU#622950

Original Release Date: 2014-04-21 | Last Revised: 2014-04-21

---

### Overview

Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions' 4690 Point of Sale operating system contains a password hashing algorithm that can be reversed. ([CWE-328](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html))

### Description

| Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions' 4690 Point of Sale operating system contains a password hashing algorithm that can be reversed. ([CWE-328](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html)) The ADXCRYPT algorithm that may be used for password hashing on the 4690 operating system is susceptible to known-plaintext attacks and hash collisions.  Additional details about this vulnerability may be found in [Security Bulletin R1005054](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=pos1R1005054). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to reverse or find a hashing collision for passwords hashed with ADXCRYPT and stored in the ADXCSOUF.DAT file. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Use "Enhanced Security"**4690 OS version V5R1 or later has the option to enable "Enhanced Security" that will use the SHA1 hashing algorithm. Instructions for enabling 4690 OS Enhanced Security can be found in the V6R4 4690 OS Planning, Installation, and Configuration Guide beginning on page 140.**Use a LDAP server for authentication**4690 OS version V6R3 or later has the option to use an LDAP server for authentication. This method will use whatever hashing algorithm the LDAP server uses. Instructions for enabling LDAP, or Directory Services, can be found in the V6R4 4690 OS Planning, Installation, and Configuration Guide beginning on page 23. |
