=== LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH - Security Advisory LSE-2014-05-21 ===

Check_MK - Arbitrary File Disclosure Vulnerability
- --------------------------------------------------

Affected Versions
=================
Linux versions of Check_MK equal or greater than commit
7e9088c09963cb2e76030e8b645607692ec56011 until Release v1.2.5i2p1.

Other platforms are not affected as the vulnerable feature is not
implemented there.

Issue Overview
==============
Technical Risk: high
Likelihood of Exploitation: high
Vendor: Mathias Kettner GmbH
Credits: LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH employees
  Markus Vervier and Sascha Kettler
Advisory URL: <https://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2014-05-21.txt>
Advisory Status: Public
CVE-Number: CVE-2014-0243

Issue Description
=================
While conducting a whitebox test LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH
discovered that the Check_MK agent processes files from a directory
with mode 1777. It is not checked if the files are symbolic or hard
filesystem links.

As the Check_MK agent runs with root permissions by default, it will
read arbitrary files and readable devices with root permissions.

The directory mode 1777 was introduced on Sep 5 15:49:46 2013 +0200
in commit 7e9088c09963cb2e76030e8b645607692ec56011:

<<>>
commit 7e9088c09963cb2e76030e8b645607692ec56011
Author: Bernd Stroessenreuther <bs () mathias-kettner de>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 15:49:46 2013 +0200

    mk-job: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job directory is now
    created with mode 1777 so mk-job can be used by
    unprivileged users too: fixing bug #1040
<<>>

The vulnerable code in the agent for reading job results from
"/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job" is:

<<>>
# Get statistics about monitored jobs
if cd /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job; then
    echo '<<<job>>>'
    head -n -0 -v *
fi
<<>>

Impact
======
A local user may create a symbolic link in the directory
"/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job", pointing to a file he normally would
not have access to like "/etc/shadow". The agent expects output from
jobs using the mk-job Tool in that directory. It will output the
content of all files in the directory on TCP port 6556 by default.

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH advises to remove the write
permissions and the sticky bit for non root users temporarily by
setting mode 755 on the directory.

Proof of Concept
================
    [myhost]$ pwd
    /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job
    [myhost]$ ls -l
    total 0
    [myhost]$ ln -s /etc/shadow
    [myhost]$ ls -la

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1101669#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 17:56:48 UTC  ``` LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH discovered that the Check_MK agent (Nagios plugin) processed files from the /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job directory which had 1777 permissions. The mk-job program did not check whether any files in this directory where symbolic or hard links.  Due to the permissions of this directory, any user could add a symbolic or hard link to any file on the filesystem, and because the Check_MK agent ran as the root user, it could expose arbitrary files via the agent, which exposes all the contents of this directory on TCP port 6556 by default.  This can be worked-around by setting mode 0755 on /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job (removing the sticky bit).  This is described in the upstream bug report [1] and fixed in git [2].  [1] <http://mathias-kettner.com/check_mk_werks.php?werk_id=978> [2] <http://git.mathias-kettner.de/git/?p=check_mk.git;a=commit;h=a2ef8d00c53ec9cbd05c4ae2f09b50761130e7ce>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1101669#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 17:58:07 UTC  ```  Created check-mk tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1101670](show_bug.cgi?id=1101670 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0243 check-mk: arbitrary file disclosure flaw as root [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1101671](show_bug.cgi?id=1101671 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-0243 check-mk: arbitrary file disclosure flaw as root [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1101669#c2)  Andrea Veri    2014-05-27 19:10:29 UTC  ``` I'll prepare a fix today.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
