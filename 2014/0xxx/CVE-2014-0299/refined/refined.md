Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the ability of a crafted webpage to corrupt memory when processed by Internet Explorer.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user, which can lead to complete system control if the user has administrative privileges.
*   **System Compromise:**  A compromised system may lead to the installation of malware, data manipulation, or creation of new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious website (e.g., via links in emails or instant messages).
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or those that accept user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to convince users to visit the malicious site.
*   **No Direct Access Required:** The attack is remote, requiring no direct physical or network access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) across various Windows operating systems.
*   The severity is rated as "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
*   The provided document confirms that this vulnerability was not publicly known at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**Mitigations and Workarounds:**

*   **Enhanced Security Configuration:** On Windows Servers, Internet Explorer runs in Enhanced Security Configuration by default, which mitigates the risk.
*  **EMET:** The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit can help mitigate exploitation of the vulnerability
*   **Security Zone Settings:** Setting Internet and local intranet security zones to "High" can block ActiveX controls and active scripting.
*   **Trusted Sites:** Adding trusted sites to the "Trusted Sites" zone can prevent the workaround from impacting normal usage.
*   **Active Scripting Control:** Users can configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running active scripting or to disable it altogether, but this may break some website functionality.
