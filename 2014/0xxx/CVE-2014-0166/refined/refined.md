Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `wp_validate_auth_cookie` function within `wp-includes/pluggable.php`. This function is responsible for verifying the validity of authentication cookies. The issue was that the function did not properly validate the authentication cookies, allowing for a potential forgery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of authentication cookies. The original code used a bitwise NOT operator (`~~`) to compare the generated hash and the cookie hash, which is not a secure comparison method. This allowed attackers to potentially forge cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to a WordPress site by forging a valid authentication cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely, indicating that the attacker does not need prior access to the server.
*   **Forged Cookies:** The attack vector involves the creation of forged authentication cookies that are then used to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Understanding of Cookie Structure:**  The attacker needs some understanding of how WordPress authentication cookies are structured to be able to forge one.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involved changing the comparison method from a bitwise NOT (`~~`) to using `hash_hmac` to hash both the original hash and provided hash, and then comparing those. This is a more robust approach to comparing the two.

**Affected Versions:**
WordPress versions prior to 3.8.2.

This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress versions 3.7.2 and 3.8.2.
