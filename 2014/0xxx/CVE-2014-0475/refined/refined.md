  "CVE-2014-0475": {
    "description": "A directory traversal flaw was found in the way glibc loaded locale files. An attacker able to make an application use a specially crafted locale name value (for example, specified in an LC_* environment variable) could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that application.",
    "root_cause": "glibc accepts relative paths with \"..\" components in the LC_* and LANG variables when loading locale files, which can lead to directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an application if they can control the locale name used by the application (e.g., through an environment variable)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting environment variables (LC_*, LANG)",
      "Specifically crafted locale name values with '..' components."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the locale environment variables (LC_*, LANG), which can be done through the environment of programs, including setuid programs, or through remote access (e.g., ssh with specific AcceptEnv settings).",
		"more_info": "The issue is caused by how glibc handles paths in the LC_* variables when loading locale files. glibc did not correctly check for directory traversal characters, such as \"..\", which allowed an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended locale directory."
  },
    "CVE-2014-5119": {
    "description": "An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in glibc's internal __gconv_translit_find() function. An attacker able to make an application call the iconv_open() function with a specially crafted argument could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that application.",
    "root_cause": "An off-by-one error in glibc's __gconv_translit_find() function leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",

     ],
     "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker must have the ability to make an application call the iconv_open() function with a specially crafted argument, or control the CHARSET environment variable.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerability lies within the internal `__gconv_translit_find()` function of glibc, which is used by `iconv_open()`. An attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow by providing a specific crafted argument that exploits the off-by-one error in the function."
