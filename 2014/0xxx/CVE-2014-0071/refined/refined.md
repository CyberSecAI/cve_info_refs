{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2014-0071": {
      "description": "It was found that PackStack did not correctly install the rules defined in the default security groups when deployed on OpenStack Networking (neutron), allowing network connections to be made to systems that should not have been accessible.",
      "root_cause": "A regression from Grizzly and Havana exists in the PackStack rules deployed to Neutron. Specifically when default security groups are enabled they are not enforced.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "PackStack failed to correctly install the rules defined in the default security groups.",
        "Neutron Security Groups fail to block network traffic"
       ],
      "impact": "Network connections could be made to systems that should not have been accessible.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network connections could bypass the intended security group restrictions due to misconfigured rules by PackStack."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker on the network can potentially bypass security groups by leveraging the misconfigured rules.",
      "additional_information": "The issue is related to how PackStack installs rules when deploying with neutron. It affects OpenStack PackStack installations using Neutron, where default security groups are enabled but are not enforced."
