  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2014-0245",
    "description": "The implementation of the GTNSubjectCreatingInterceptor class in gatein-wsrp was not thread safe. For a specific WSRP endpoint, under high-concurrency scenarios or scenarios where SOAP messages take long to execute, it was possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain privileged information if WS-Security is enabled for the WSRP Consumer and the endpoint in question is being used by a privileged user.",
    "affected_component": "GTNSubjectCreatingInterceptor class in gatein-wsrp",
    "root_cause": "The GTNSubjectCreatingInterceptor class was not thread-safe, leading to concurrency issues when handling requests.",
    "vulnerability": "Unsafe concurrency handling in interceptor.",
    "impact": "Information disclosure. An unauthenticated remote attacker could gain privileged information.",
    "attack_vector": "Network; specifically exploiting a WSRP endpoint under high concurrency or scenarios with long-running SOAP messages.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker capable of sending network requests to a vulnerable WSRP endpoint is required.",
     "additional_details": "Exploitation requires WS-Security to be enabled for the WSRP Consumer, and the targeted endpoint to be used by a privileged user."
