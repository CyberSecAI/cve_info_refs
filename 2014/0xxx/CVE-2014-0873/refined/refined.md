- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Attack vectors:** By tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page, an attacker can send requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must trick a user into performing actions they did not intend to perform while the user is authenticated to the target application.
