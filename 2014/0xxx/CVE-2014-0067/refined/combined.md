# 2014-02-20 Consolidated Security Update

The 2014-02-20 update contains fixes for multiple security issues. Most of these are "Class C" security issues, meaning that they require prior valid login for privilege escalation. Some also require additional database conditions to be true in order to be exploited. One fix below breaks backwards compatibility in a way that complies with our documentation but not with past behavior.

Summaries below provided by Noah Misch and Tom Lane.

## Vulnerability during "make check"

[CVE-2014-0067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0067) PostgreSQL: Vulnerability during "make check"

**This issue is not fixed in this release. It was fixed in later releases. Please update to the very latest minor version in order to have this issue fully patched.**

We are posting it in the interests of transparency, and so that database administrators and security staff will take the appropriate measures to secure their servers.

### Explanation

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group security team has discovered a
vulnerability in the scripts that orchestrate PostgreSQL
test suites that validate the functionality of the PostgreSQL binaries.
While a test suite is running, a user with interactive access to the system
can hijack the operating system user account running
the suite. Only users who run "make check" on a system they share with
untrusted users are at risk. A future set of update releases will fix
this vulnerability, though there will be no need to reinstall existing
deployments. In the meantime, users are advised to run the test suites
only on non-shared systems or under operating system user accounts
dedicated to the task of running test suites.

This vulnerability arises from the test scripts' use of "initdb" to create
a PostgreSQL database cluster permitting local "trust" authentication.
User-crafted workflows doing the same will exhibit the same vulnerability.
We recommend studying automated usage of initdb in your own software. If
a procedure in question could run on a system shared with untrusted users,
follow the same precautions around that procedure as for the PostgreSQL
test suites. The fix for PostgreSQL itself will establish a secure
pattern for automating initdb, which you can later adopt.

On Unix-like platforms the attacker needs to be able to reach the server's
socket file, so the risk depends on where the platform places the socket
file and whether there are filesystem permissions protections in place.
On Windows, the server opens a locally-accessible TCP socket, so there is
no possibility of ameliorating the risk through filesystem permissions.

The changes required to make this situation safer are expected to be
somewhat invasive and might break user-crafted testing workflows.
Therefore, the PostgreSQL project will not actually be supplying a fix on
20-Feb, merely announcing that there is a problem and recommending that
users not use "make check" on machines shared with untrusted users. Suitable changes to the regression testing setup will subsequently
be debated publicly and can be expected to be incorporated in future
releases.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

## SET ROLE bypasses lack of ADMIN OPTION

[CVE-2014-0060](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0060) PostgreSQL: SET ROLE bypasses lack of ADMIN OPTION

**This change will break backwards compatibility for users who were expecting the prior, broken behavior. The new behavior is in compliance with the documentation.**

### Explanation

Enforce ADMIN OPTION restrictions.

Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
from adding or removing members from the granted role. Issuing SET ROLE
before the GRANT bypassed that, because the role itself had an implicit
right to add or remove members. This issue was fixed by recognizing that
implicit right only when the session user matches the current role.
Additionally, do not recognize it during a security-restricted operation
or during execution of a SECURITY DEFINER function. The restriction on
SECURITY DEFINER is not security-critical. However, it seems best for a
user testing his or her own SECURITY DEFINER function to see the same behavior
others will see. Affects all supported versions back to 8.4.

The SQL standards do not conflate roles and users as PostgreSQL does;
only SQL roles have members, and only SQL users initiate sessions. An
application using PostgreSQL users and roles as SQL users and roles will
never attempt to grant membership in the role that is the session user,
so the implicit right to add or remove members will never arise.

The security impact was mostly that a role member could revoke access
from others, contrary to the wishes of the role member's grantor. Unapproved
role member additions are less notable, because the member can still largely
achieve that by creating a view or a SECURITY DEFINER function.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch and Jonas Sundman for reporting
this problem.

## Language validators are accessible for everyone

[CVE-2014-0061](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0061) PostgreSQL: Privilege escalation via explicit calls to validator functions

### Explanation

PostgreSQL procedural languages (PLs) normally provide a "validator"
function that performs creation-time checking of syntax etc. for
functions written in that language. These validator functions can
be called directly from SQL, too, which is intended to allow post-facto
checking of existing function definitions. However, unexpected and
possibly insecure results could be obtained by feeding the text of a
function defined in one language to the validator for another language.
Moreover, in many languages the validator might perform some limited amount
of code execution, opening the possibility of an attacker executing
code without permission. The security impact is thus that an authenticated
database user might be able to escalate his or her privileges.

The fix will cause validator functions to throw an error when used
against a function defined in another language, or against a function
the current user doesn't have permissions to call.

While the PostgreSQL project will fix the validator functions in PLs
distributed with PostgreSQL, the same two-line fix will be needed in
validator functions of PLs developed externally. There are many
such extensions and we cannot be certain that all of their developers
will respond promptly.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andres Freund for reporting this problem.

## Race condition in CREATE INDEX allows for privilege escalation

[CVE-2014-0062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0062) PostgreSQL: Race condition in CREATE INDEX allows for privilege escalation

### Description

CREATE INDEX, and some ALTER TABLE statements, did multiple
independent lookups of the table the index is
supposed to be created on. Concurrent creation or deletion of another
table of the same name (but in a different schema) might cause some of
these lookups to find one table and some the other table. This allows
effects such as creating an index on a table one doesn't own, thus
exposing data to the calling user that should not be able to access.
This vulnerability exists in all affected versions, but is more easily exploited in 9.2 and 9.3.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andres Freund for reporting this problem.

## Potential Buffer Overruns in Datetime Input/Output

* [CVE-2014-0063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0063) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns in datetime input/output

### Descriptions

Many functions use the MAXDATELEN constant to size a buffer for parsing
or displaying a datetime value. However, the buffer was much too small
for the longest possible interval output and slightly too small for certain valid
timestamp inputs, particularly input with a long timezone name.
Inputs that were too long would be rejected needlessly, while outputs
that were too long would result in stack corruption, which could crash
the server and could be exploitable for arbitrary code execution.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Daniel Sch√ºssler for reporting this problem.

## Buffer overflow in path\_in()

* [CVE-2014-0064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0064) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns due to integer overflow in size calculations

### Description

Predict integer overflow to avoid buffer overruns.

Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
size such that the calculation wrapped to a small positive value when
arguments implied a sufficiently-large requirement. Writes past the end
of the inadvertent small allocation followed shortly thereafter.
Coverity Scan identified the path\_in() vulnerability; code inspection led to
the rest. In passing, add check\_stack\_depth() to prevent stack overflow
in related functions.

Affects all supported versions back to 8.4. The non-comment hstore
changes touch code that did not exist in 8.4, so that part stops at 9.0.

## Potential Buffer Overruns of Fixed-Size Buffers

* [CVE-2014-0065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0065) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns of fixed-size buffers

### Explanation

Coverity Scan identified a number of places in which it could not prove that a
string being copied into a fixed-size buffer would fit. We believe that
most, perhaps all of these, are in fact safe or are copying data that is
coming from a trusted source so that any overrun is not really a
security issue. Nonetheless it seems prudent to forestall any risk by
using strlcpy() and similar functions.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Peter Eisentraut and Jozef Mlich for reporting
this problem.

## Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL

[CVE-2014-0066](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0066) PostgreSQL: Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL

### Explanation

The chkpass extension uses the standard crypt() library function, which
is defined to return NULL on failure, but it was not checking for NULL
before using the result. The main practical case in which this could be
an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute unapproved
hashing algorithms ("FIPS mode").

The PostgreSQL project thanks Honza Horak for reporting this problem.

# PostgreSQL 9.3.3, 9.2.7, 9.1.12, 9.0.16 and 8.4.20 released!

Posted on **2014-02-20** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an important update to all supported versions of the PostgreSQL database system, which includes minor versions 9.3.3, 9.2.7, 9.1.12, 9.0.16, and 8.4.20. This update contains fixes for multiple security issues, as well as several fixes for replication and data integrity issues. All users are urged to update their installations at the earliest opportunity, especially those using binary replication or running a high-security application.

## Security Fixes

This update fixes [CVE-2014-0060](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0060), in which PostgreSQL did not properly enforce the WITH ADMIN OPTION permission for ROLE management. Before this fix, any member of a ROLE was able to grant others access to the same ROLE regardless if the member was given the WITH ADMIN OPTION permission. It also fixes multiple privilege escalation issues, including: [CVE-2014-0061](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0061), [CVE-2014-0062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0062), [CVE-2014-0063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0063), [CVE-2014-0064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0064), [CVE-2014-0065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0065), and [CVE-2014-0066](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0066). More information on these issues can be found on [our security page](http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/) and [the security issue detail wiki page](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/20140220securityrelease).

With this release, we are also alerting users to a known security
hole that allows other users on the same machine to gain access to an
operating system account while it is doing "make check": [CVE-2014-0067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0067). "Make check" is normally part of building PostgreSQL from source code. As it is not possible to fix this issue without causing significant issues to our testing infrastructure, a patch will be released separately and publicly. Until then, users are strongly advised not to run "make check" on machines where untrusted users have accounts.

## Replication and Data Integrity Fixes

This update also fixes some issues which affect binary replication and row locking, and can cause recoverable data corruption in some cases. There are several fixes to index page locking issue during replication which can cause indexes on the replica to be corrupted. There is a fix to a transaction freezing bug in version 9.3 which could cause databases which cycled through transaction ID wraparound several times to have old row versions reappear. We have also fixed three bugs which could cause new standbys to fail to start up. Finally, this update fixes an issue which could break foreign keys, although the keys themselves will still need to be fixed manually after applying the update.

In version 9.3, these fixes result in the addition of several new server configuration settings to control multixact freezing. Importantly, standby servers must be updated to 9.3.3 or later before the replication master is updated, or replication will be broken.

## Other Improvements

In addition to the above, the following issues are fixed in this release:

* Fix WAL logging of visibility map change
* Make sure that GIN indexes log all insertions
* Get pause\_at\_recovery\_target to pause at correct time
* Ensure walreceiver sends hot-standby feedback messages on time
* Prevent timeout interrupts from taking control away from mainline code
* Eliminate several race conditions
* Fix some broken HINTs in error messages
* Prevent server lockup on SSL connection loss
* Fix two Unicode handling issues
* Prevent crash on certain subselect syntax
* Prevent crash on select from zero column table
* Fix two bugs with LATERAL
* Fix issue with UNION ALL, partitioning, and updates
* Ensure that ANALYZE understands domains over ranges
* Eliminate permissions check when using default tablespace
* Fix memory leakage in JSON functions
* Allow extensions with event triggers
* Distinguish numbers correctly in JSON output
* Fix permissions for pg\_start\_backup() and pg\_stop\_backup()
* Accept SHIFT\_JIS as locale name
* Fix .\* expansion for SQL function variables
* Prevent infinite loop on some COPY connection failures
* Several fixes for client issues on Windows
* Enable building PostgreSQL with Visual Studio 2013
* Update time zone files for recent changes

There are also fixes to all of the following optional modules (extensions): ECPG, dblink, ISN, pgbench, pg\_stat\_statements and postgres\_fdw. Additional changes and details of some of the above issues can be found in the Release Notes.

As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries. Users who have skipped multiple update releases may need to perform additional post-update steps; see the Release Notes for details.

Package        : postgresql-8.4
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0060 CVE-2014-0061 CVE-2014-0062 CVE-2014-0063
                 CVE-2014-0064 CVE-2014-0065 CVE-2014-0066 CVE-2014-0067

Various vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL:

 * Shore up GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION restrictions (Noah Misch)

   Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
   from adding or removing members from the granted role, but this
   restriction was easily bypassed by doing SET ROLE first. The security
   impact is mostly that a role member can revoke the access of others,
   contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role member additions
   are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role member could provide
   most of his rights to others anyway by creating views or SECURITY
   DEFINER functions. (CVE-2014-0060)

 * Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator functions
   (Andres Freund)

   The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
   during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a
   user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually
   written in some other language was not checked for and could be
   exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a
   call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function.
   Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to
   their own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)

 * Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert Haas,
   Andres Freund)

   If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
   activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
   than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this can be used
   to cause the permissions checks to be performed against a different
   table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
   attack. (CVE-2014-0062)

 * Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)

   The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
   type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although the
   datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
   overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
   inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
   library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
   (CVE-2014-0063)

 * Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
   (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)

   Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
   size without checking for overflow. If overflow did occur, a too-small
   buffer would be allocated and then written past. (CVE-2014-0064)

 * Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)

   Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee that
   fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is
   unclear whether these cases really represent live issues, since in most
   cases there appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input
   string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
   this type. (CVE-2014-0065)

 * Avoid crashing if crypt() returns NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)

   There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
   but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
   this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
   unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., "FIPS mode"). (CVE-2014-0066)

 * Document risks of make check in the regression testing instructions
   (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)

   Since the temporary server started by make check uses "trust"
   authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it as
   database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
   operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
   probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
   risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
   just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted users
   on the same machine. (CVE-2014-0067)

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.4.20-0squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.3.3-1 of the postgresql-9.3 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.

   written in some other language was not checked for and could be
   exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a
   call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function.
   Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to
   their own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)

 * Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert Haas,
   Andres Freund)

   If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
   activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
   than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this can be used
   to cause the permissions checks to be performed against a different
   table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
   attack. (CVE-2014-0062)

 * Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)

   The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
   type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although the
   datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
   overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
   inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
   library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
   (CVE-2014-0063)

 * Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
   (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)

   Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
   size without checking for overflow. If overflow did occur, a too-small
   buffer would be allocated and then written past. (CVE-2014-0064)

 * Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)

   Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee that
   fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is
   unclear whether these cases really represent live issues, since in most
   cases there appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input
   string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
   this type. (CVE-2014-0065)

 * Avoid crashing if crypt() returns NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)

   There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
   but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
   this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
   unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., "FIPS mode"). (CVE-2014-0066)

 * Document risks of make check in the regression testing instructions
   (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)

   Since the temporary server started by make check uses "trust"
   authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it as
   database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
   operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
   probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
   risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
   just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted users
   on the same machine. (CVE-2014-0067)

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1_9.1.12-0wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.3.3-1 of the postgresql-9.3 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.
