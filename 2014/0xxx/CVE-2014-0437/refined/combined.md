# MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201409-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in MySQL, worst of which
allows local attackers to escalate their privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.39** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.39** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could possibly gain escalated privileges. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted SQL query, possibly resulting in
a Denial of Service condition. A remote attacker could entice a user to
connect to specially crafted MySQL server, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.5.39"

```

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0186)

## Topic

Updated mysql55-mysql packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server.
Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch
Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2013-5807,
CVE-2013-5891, CVE-2014-0386, CVE-2014-0393, CVE-2014-0401, CVE-2014-0402,
CVE-2014-0412, CVE-2014-0420, CVE-2014-0437, CVE-2013-3839, CVE-2013-5908)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the MySQL command line client
tool (mysql) processed excessively long version strings. If a user
connected to a malicious MySQL server via the mysql client, the server
could use this flaw to crash the mysql client or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the user running the mysql client. (CVE-2014-0001)

The CVE-2014-0001 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.5.36. Refer to the MySQL
Release Notes listed in the References section for a complete list
of changes.

All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon
(mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1054592#c0)  Garth Mollett    2014-01-17 05:39:44 UTC  ``` The MySQL client in both MySQL and MariaDB contains a buffer overflow when reading the server version information.  This maybe exploited by connecting to a malicious/compromised db server or by a MITM and potentially allows execution of arbitrary code as the user running the client.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1054592#c9)  Honza Horak    2014-01-22 19:05:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 854008](attachment.cgi?id=854008&action=diff "proposed fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=854008&action=edit "proposed fix") proposed fix  This fix is really simple, just check buffer size properly.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1054592#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-29 08:28:02 UTC  ``` Note that this issue affects mysql, the command-line tool / SQL shell, not the libmysqlclient library.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1054592#c12)  Huzaifa S.

While those versions have the relevant sprintf() call, there's difference in the length of the version string returned by the server_version_string() function.  In versions before 5.1.34, buffer used to store server version string returned by server_version_string() was static with the length of 128.  The buffer glob_buffer to which sprintf prints the connection info was allocated to size of 512, hence sprintf could not overflow it and long version string presented by server would be printed truncted.  The server_version_string() function was changed in version 5.1.34 to avoid the problem with truncation of long version strings.  The function was modified to dynamically allocate buffer for the version string, possibly to be longer than glob_buffer size of 512.  Hence this security flaw was introduced.  Upstream bug, upstream commit, and release notes related to the server_version_string() change in 5.1.34 that introduced this issue:  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=43153> <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mysql/mysql-server/5.1/revision/2728.10.6> <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.1/en/news-5-1-34.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1054592#c25)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-12 09:18:47 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1088197](show_bug.cgi?id=1088197 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2014-2440 mysql: unspecified vulnerability related to Client (CPU April 2014)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0189)

## Topic

Updated mariadb55-mariadb packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary
compatible with MySQL.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MariaDB database server.
Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch
Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2013-5807,
CVE-2013-5891, CVE-2014-0386, CVE-2014-0393, CVE-2014-0401, CVE-2014-0402,
CVE-2014-0412, CVE-2014-0420, CVE-2014-0437, CVE-2013-3839, CVE-2013-5908)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the MariaDB command line client
tool (mysql) processed excessively long version strings. If a user
connected to a malicious MariaDB server via the mysql client, the server
could use this flaw to crash the mysql client or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the user running the mysql client. (CVE-2014-0001)

The CVE-2014-0001 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

These updated packages upgrade MariaDB to version 5.5.35. Refer to the
MariaDB Release Notes listed in the References section for a complete list
of changes.

All MariaDB users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing this update, the MariaDB server daemon
(mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0173)

## Topic

Updated mysql55-mysql packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server.
Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch
Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2013-5807,
CVE-2013-5891, CVE-2014-0386, CVE-2014-0393, CVE-2014-0401, CVE-2014-0402,
CVE-2014-0412, CVE-2014-0420, CVE-2014-0437, CVE-2013-3839, CVE-2013-5908)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the MySQL command line client
tool (mysql) processed excessively long version strings. If a user
connected to a malicious MySQL server via the mysql client, the server
could use this flaw to crash the mysql client or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the user running the mysql client. (CVE-2014-0001)

The CVE-2014-0001 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.5.36. Refer to the MySQL
Release Notes listed in the References section for a complete list
of changes.

All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon
(mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Topic

Updated mysql packages that fix several security issues and one bug are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server.
Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch
Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2014-0386,
CVE-2014-0393, CVE-2014-0401, CVE-2014-0402, CVE-2014-0412, CVE-2014-0437,
CVE-2013-5908)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the MySQL command line client
tool (mysql) processed excessively long version strings. If a user
connected to a malicious MySQL server via the mysql client, the server
could use this flaw to crash the mysql client or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code as the user running the mysql client. (CVE-2014-0001)

The CVE-2014-0001 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Prior to this update, MySQL did not check whether a MySQL socket was

actually being used by any process before starting the mysqld service. If a
particular mysqld service did not exit cleanly while a socket was being
used by a process, this socket was considered to be still in use during the
next start-up of this service, which resulted in a failure to start the
service up. With this update, if a socket exists but is not used by any
process, it is ignored during the mysqld service start-up. (BZ#1058719)

These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.1.73. Refer to the MySQL
Release Notes listed in the References section for a complete list of
