Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-0908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue is the lack of an authorization mechanism for the User Attribute feature within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM). This missing authorization allows any user to read and modify user attribute values of both themselves and other users via REST APIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of access controls for user attributes.
- **Insecure REST API:** The REST APIs related to user attributes are vulnerable due to the lack of authorization checks.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** User attributes could potentially store sensitive information (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, confidential data), which becomes exposed due to the lack of access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Users can read other users' attribute values, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Data Modification:**  Users can modify attributes of other users without authorization.
- **Security Exposure:** This lack of authorization can create a significant security risk because attributes are used in email notifications, task assignments, and can contain confidential user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Exploitation:** Attackers can use the REST API endpoints associated with user attributes to read and modify attribute data.
- **Direct Access:** Any user with access to the REST API can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to REST API:** The attacker needs network access to the BPM server where the vulnerable REST API is exposed.
- **BPM User Account:** The attacker must have a valid BPM user account to make requests against the vulnerable API.

**Additional Details:**
-   **Affected Products:**  The vulnerability affects various versions of IBM Business Process Manager Standard, Express, and Advanced (V7.5.x, 8.0.x, 8.5.x).
-   **Fix:** The fix for this vulnerability involves introducing a configurable whitelist to control which attributes are readable by all users (public-attribute), and which can be updated by users for their own profile (self-manageable-attribute).
-   **Action Policy:** An action policy (ACTION_MANAGE_ANY_USERATTRIBUTE) is introduced to grant administrators full access to all user attributes using REST APIs.
-   **Workarounds:** Before the fix, IBM provided workarounds that include not using user attributes for sensitive information, blocking write access to the user REST API using a firewall, or not exposing the user resource REST API.
-   **Fix Availability:** Interim fixes are available on IBM Fix Central (APAR JR49505).
