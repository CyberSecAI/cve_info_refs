  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2014-0192",
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access provisioning template previews via the hostname parameter.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application did not enforce authentication when the `hostname` parameter was used to spoof a host in the unattended provisioning URL, thus bypassing authorization checks.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Inadequate authorization checks.",
        "Information disclosure."
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated user can retrieve the provisioning template of any host by exploiting the spoofing functionality, potentially exposing sensitive information within the templates.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/unattended/provision` endpoint with a `hostname` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication is required. The attacker only needs to know the URL endpoint and a hostname for which they want to retrieve the template.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability was introduced with commit `1e0fd283` which allowed overriding spoof via a hostname parameter. The authorization filters were only applied when the spoof parameter was not used. This vulnerability affects Foreman versions 1.4.0 to 1.4.3 inclusive."
