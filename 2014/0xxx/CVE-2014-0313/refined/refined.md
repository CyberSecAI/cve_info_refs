Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability that arises from improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The specific error is when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains full control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would need to convince a user to visit this malicious website using Internet Explorer. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques such as phishing emails, instant messages with malicious links, or via compromised websites that host the malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website. They also need to be able to convince a user to visit the website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the user's machine beforehand.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-012 addresses CVE-2014-0313 along with 17 other privately reported vulnerabilities and 1 publicly disclosed one.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Internet Explorer on Windows clients and "Moderate" for servers.
*   The bulletin mentions that the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate this vulnerability on systems where it's installed and configured.
*   The vulnerability is not applicable to Server Core installations of Windows Server.
*   The provided content mentions that the vulnerability was reported by Omair of Zero Day Initiative.

**Summary:** CVE-2014-0313 is a remote code execution vulnerability caused by memory corruption due to improper object handling in Internet Explorer. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious website. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with user-level privileges, which can lead to full system compromise for administrative users.
