- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An input project-file validation vulnerability exists within the KepServerEX V4 component of Schneider Electric's SCADA Expert ClearSCADA. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer when parsing project files. This flaw is located in the ServerMain.exe file, which is part of the vulnerable KepServerEX V4 component within the PLC driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This occurs during the parsing of project files by the KepServerEX V4 component, which is included in older versions of the PLC driver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the process to crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input project file, specifically targeting a vulnerability within the PLC driver, which is located in the ServerMain.exe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the system to provide the malicious project file. The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable. The attacker needs moderate skills to create the malicious file.
