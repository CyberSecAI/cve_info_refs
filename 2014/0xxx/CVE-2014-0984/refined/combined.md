SAP Router Password Timing Attack

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: SAP Router Password Timing Attack
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0003
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/sap-router-password-timing-attack
Date published: 2014-04-15
Date of last update: 2014-03-06
Vendors contacted: SAP
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy [CWE-208]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0984

3. *Vulnerability Description*

      SAP Router [1]  is an application-level gateway used to
      connect systems in a SAP infrastructure. A vulnerability
      have been found in SAP Router that could allow an unauthenticated
      remote attacker to obtain passwords used to protect route entries
by a
      timing side-channel attack.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . SAP Router release 721 patch level 117.
   . SAP Router release 720 patch level 411.
   . SAP Router release 710 patch level 029.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

      SAP released the security note
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1986895
      regarding these issues. Contact SAP for further information.

      Martin Gallo proposed the following actions to mitigate the
      impact of the vulnerabilities:

   1. Disable the use of passwords on the Route Permission Table [2].

   2. Enforce the use of SNC (Secure Network Communications) as an
      authentication mechanism for securing routes.

6. *Credits*

      This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo
from Core
      Security Consulting Services. The publication of this advisory was
      coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

      SAP Router permits and/or forbids networks connections based on a
      Route Permission Table [2]. Entries in the
      Route Permission Table can have a password. If a password is
specified
      for a given entry in the Route Permission Table, SAP Router checks
whether
      the user-supplied password matches with the one in the Route
Permission
      Table entry before permitting a connection.

      The vulnerable function 'passwordCheck'
      performs a non-constant time string comparison for checking the
      user-supplied password against the on in the Route Permission Table.
      On the first non-matched character, the string comparison function
      immediately interrupts the evaluation cycle, which may let an
attacker perform timing attacks.
      The following snippet shows an excerpt of the vulnerable code
within the
      'passwordCheck' function:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
