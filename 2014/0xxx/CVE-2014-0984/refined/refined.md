Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0984:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `passwordCheck` function of the SAP Router. This function performs a non-constant time string comparison when checking a user-supplied password against the password stored in the Route Permission Table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Side-Channel Attack:** The `passwordCheck` function exits immediately upon finding the first non-matching character. This creates a timing difference in the execution, which can be exploited by an attacker to deduce the correct password character-by-character. Specifically, comparison of the provided password against the stored password is not done in constant time, with early exits based on mismatching characters which exposes information to timing attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Security bypass:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain passwords used to protect route entries in the SAP Router. This would enable the attacker to bypass security restrictions and gain unauthorized access to systems behind the SAP router.
- **Information Exposure:** The timing discrepancy reveals information about the password, character by character, allowing an attacker to reconstruct it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- An attacker interacts with the SAP Router service by sending specially crafted network packets with varying password attempts.
- By measuring the time taken by the SAP Router to respond, an attacker can determine if the supplied characters are correct or not. This allows the attacker to reveal the password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the SAP Router service.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the capability to perform time measurements of responses received from the SAP Router service.

**Vulnerable packages:**
- SAP Router release 721 patch level 117.
- SAP Router release 720 patch level 411.
- SAP Router release 710 patch level 029.
- Other versions are likely affected as well

**Mitigation:**
- Disable passwords on the route permission table.
- Enforce SNC (Secure Network Communication) as an authentication mechanism.
- Apply the patch provided by SAP in security note 1986895.
