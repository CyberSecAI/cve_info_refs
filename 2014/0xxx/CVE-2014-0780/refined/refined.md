Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-0780

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The NTWebServer, a test web server included with InduSoft Web Studio, has a flaw that allows path traversal. This means an attacker can manipulate file paths to access directories and files outside the intended web root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The vulnerability lies in the web server's failure to properly restrict access to files and directories, allowing an attacker to use "../" sequences in a URL to navigate outside the web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, including application files, which might contain sensitive information such as application passwords.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** By obtaining credentials through file access, an attacker could potentially gain control over the system, allowing them to deploy malicious code remotely. This is achieved by accessing the Web Studio software itself.
- **Adverse Application Conditions:**  Exploitation can lead to various problems in the application, which could impact production environments where the SCADA system is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Manipulated URL:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request containing ".." sequences to traverse directories and access files outside the web root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable InduSoft Web Studio.
- **Low Skill:** The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit, requiring only basic knowledge of HTTP and path manipulation.

**Additional Information:**

- The exploit-db content provides a metasploit module for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in InduSoft Web Studio version 7.1 and prior, before SP2 Patch 4.
- The vulnerable web server is intended for demonstration/training purposes and should not be used in production environments.
- A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 has been assigned with the vector string AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, indicating high impact in confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
