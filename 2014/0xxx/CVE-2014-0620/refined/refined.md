```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Technicolor TC7200 router is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple web interface functionalities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Persistent XSS: Malicious scripts can be injected through the "ADDNewDomain" parameter within the parental website filter settings. The injected script is then stored and executed whenever the relevant page is accessed by another user.
  - Reflected XSS: Malicious scripts can be injected via the "VmTracerouteHost" parameter in the diagnostics-route functionality. The script is reflected back to the user and executed within their browser.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, passwords)
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Attack vectors:
  - Persistent XSS: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/parental/website-filters.asp` endpoint, embedding a malicious script in the `ADDNewDomain` parameter.
  - Reflected XSS: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/goform/status/diagnostics-route` endpoint, embedding a malicious script in the `VmTracerouteHost` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Technicolor TC7200 router's web interface. This could be from the local network or, in some cases, remotely if the web interface is exposed to the internet.
    - The attacker must have the ability to send POST requests to the router's web interface and manipulate parameters.
