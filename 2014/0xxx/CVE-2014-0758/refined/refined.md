**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure ActiveX control within ICONICS GENESIS32, specifically how the `GenLaunch.htm` file launches GENESIS32 applications. This control allows arbitrary executable code to be launched without proper authentication or permission checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure ActiveX control: The ActiveX control is not properly secured, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- Exposed dangerous method or function: The vulnerable ActiveX control exposes a dangerous method that can be exploited to launch executables.
- Lack of authentication/permission checks: The ActiveX control does not require any authentication or permission elevation to launch executable code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a system by exploiting the insecure ActiveX control. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or disruption of operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious web page containing a script that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- The user must be socially engineered to visit the attacker's web page in order to trigger the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a web page containing the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to be able to socially engineer a user to visit their web page.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
