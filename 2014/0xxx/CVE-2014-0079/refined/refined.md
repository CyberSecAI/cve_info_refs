Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference within the Zarafa server daemon when handling authentication data, specifically when a null password is provided. This is similar to CVE-2014-0037 which involves null username, and both issues are in same source code function related to authentication data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The server attempts to use a password field that can be NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit will crash the `zarafa-server` daemon. As this daemon provides the MAPI in SOAP service required by other Zarafa components, the entire Zarafa functionality becomes unavailable until the service is restarted. This affects all legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can remotely trigger the vulnerability without needing to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the Zarafa server. No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Robert Scheck.
- The issue affects Zarafa versions from at least 6.20.0 (and possibly even from 5.00) up to and including 7.1.8 final.
- The issue was more easily reproducible on community builds rather than official Zarafa binary packages due to different build-time flags and libraries.
- A patch was created to address this issue which involves a check for a NULL password before use in the code.
- The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2014-0037, though both vulnerabilities are related to NULL pointer dereferences in the same source code functions and related to authentication data and have similar exploitation vectors.
- Red Hat assigned CVE-2014-0079 to this issue after verifying it was a distinct security flaw from CVE-2014-0037.
- The fix was included in Zarafa 7.1.8 builds.
