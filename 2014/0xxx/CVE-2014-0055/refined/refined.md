{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_rx_bufs()` function in the Linux kernel's `vhost-net` implementation did not properly handle error conditions reported by `vhost_get_vq_desc()`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient error handling in `get_rx_bufs()` when processing results from `vhost_get_vq_desc()`. This could lead to a crash due to dereferencing invalid memory or other undefined behavior.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A privileged user within a guest virtual machine can crash the host operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "A privileged user inside a guest virtual machine can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to `vhost_net`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a privileged account within a guest virtual machine."
