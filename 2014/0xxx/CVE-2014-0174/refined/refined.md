Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the Cumin application did not set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies. This allows client-side scripts, typically JavaScript, to access these cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A malicious script could access the session cookie, potentially leading to:
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:**  An attacker might use the exposed session cookie to perform XSS attacks by impersonating a user.
*   **Session Hijacking:** With access to session cookies, an attacker could hijack a legitimate user's session, gaining access to their account and sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a malicious script. This could be injected via a XSS vulnerability or by other means that allow execution of arbitrary code on the client side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Script:**  An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script into the user's browser, this can be via a classic XSS vulnerability or by other means.
*   **Targeted User Must Have a Valid Session:** The targeted user must have an active session with the Cumin application for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a "Moderate" security impact.
*   This vulnerability is fixed in the updated cumin packages.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Stanislav Graf of Red Hat.
*   The fix involves setting the HttpOnly flag on session cookies, preventing access by client-side scripts.
