How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Spring Framework's Migration from Jira to GitHub Issues

[Engineering](/blog/category/engineering) | [Rossen Stoyanchev](/team/rstoyanchev) |  January 15, 2019 | [...](/blog/2019/01/15/spring-framework-s-migration-from-jira-to-github-issues#disqus_thread)

The Spring Framework has migrated its entire history of issues from Jira to GitHub. The goal of this blog post is to provide you with context and details about this move.

# Migration Details

---

The entire 15+ year history of every Spring Framework issue, and every comment, has been imported into GitHub. There is a lot to consider in such a move, so let's take a tour and go over some details.

### Links

If you have a link to an existing issue, e.g. <https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16751>, you'll be redirected to the corresponding GitHub issue. If you actually mean to go to the Jira issue, append the query parameter `redirect=false`. On the GitHub side, the imported issue has a link back to its Jira issue origin.

Jira issue keys that appear in text, e.g. "SPR-16751", have been replaced with GitHub [issue references](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/) which has the benefit of inserting links in the timelines of issues on both sides. Another benefit is the mini-preview when you mouse over the link.

Jira issues keys to other Spring projects that appear in text, e.g. "DATAJPA-813", have been replaced with links. For example see [#18558](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18558) with a link to Spring Data JPA, [#20904](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20904) to Spring Data MongoDB, and [#16906](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/16906) to Spring Integration Extensions.

Links to other GitHub project issues and pull requests that appear in text, get automatic benefits. After the migration, there are links in the timelines of the referenced issues that point back to the Spring Framework, and you get a preview of the link with a mouse over. For example see [#21362](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21362) with a link to Spring Boot, [#20849](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20849#issuecomment-453465173) to JUnit, [#20256](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20256) to Jackson.

Links to commits and source code of any project on GitHub, get automatic benefits too. For example see the link to a source code range in issue [#18463](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18463).

### Jira Details

Every imported issue displays information from Jira in the bottom half of its description. The idea is that all information from Jira is available on GitHub and you don't have to go back and forth between the two. You may see one or more of the following, when available:

* Affected versions
* Reference URL
* Attachments
* Sub-tasks and related issues
* Pull requests and commit references
* Backport versions
* Vote and watcher counts

Note that votes and watch subscriptions could not be carried over to GitHub. Even if spring-issuemaster has full privileges, it can only vote once. So please visit GitHub issues and re-apply reactions and subscribe to receive updates for specific issues.

### Labels

Some Jira fields were converted to GitHub issue labels:

| Jira Field | Label |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Type | `"type: *"` |
| Status | `"status: *"` |
| Resolution | `"status: *"` |
| Component | `"in: *"` |

Two extra labels were also applied to imported issues:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"has: votes-jira"` | imported issues with 10+ votes |
| `"has: backports"` | issues with backport versions |

We used the opportunity to streamline the Jira field values, so for example 25 component values in Jira correspond to 5 `"in: *"` labels on GitHub. The `"status: *"` and the `"type: *"` labels have also been given extra through and revised.

Our choice of labels is aligned with the labels used in Spring Boot. The Boot team has given their process and labels a lot of thought, and we know the consistency will be appreciated by many. See the complete [set of labels](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/labels).

In Jira, many fields and labels are modifiable. In GitHub, only contributors can add or remove labels. This makes perfect sense. Reporters simply describe the issue, while contributors categorize it. Both developers and contributors can use the labels to search.

### Fix Versions

A Jira issue can have multiple fix versions, while a GitHub issue can have only one target milestone. This feels like a drawback but there is more than is apparent to the eye, and the constraint has forced us to consider some meaningful adjustments.

Take [SPR-17226](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17226?redirect=false) for example with fix versions "4.3.19", "5.0.9", and "5.1 RC3". While the issue was fixed in all 3 versions, there is no need to pollute the release notes of "5.1 RC3" which was still in development at the time. We can instead say it was fixed in 5.0.9 and backported to 4.3.19, and it's a contributors' concern to make sure the fix is propagated to the next version that's still in development. This is how it shows on the GitHub issue [#21759](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21759) Could we have made this adjustment in the past? Sure, but the support for multiple fix versions in Jira didn't force us to consider.

This is a small adjustment that will result in cleaner release notes, but it will also impact the way we commit fixes. When the next version is in development on master, we will apply the fix to the current production branch first, then forward merge to master, and then cherry-pick from the older production branch. As opposed to apply the fix to master, and then cherry-pick from the production branches. The result is a cleaner commit history since forward merges help git to be aware or related changes.

As for backports, since an issue can have only one target milestone, we must create separate issues to represent the backporting of a fix. To use the same example, it pays to pick "5.0.9" as the target milestone because we'd have one backport issue only. If we picked "5.1 RC3", we would need two backport issues instead. To give you sense of the huge difference this makes, say the Spring Framework was on GitHub Issues from day 1. If we used the latter approach we'd have about 2,500 backport issues today. If we used the former, we would have about a 1000.

For historic backports, we've created one issue holder per release. There are about [45 of those](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=in%3Atitle+%22backported+issues%22). Going forward we'll have individual issues for all backported fixes which will be created automatically and used mainly for release tracking. As for discussions, the majority of conversations should happen on the main issue, while backport issues will be used only for discussions specific to the backport.

### Markup

The markup was without a doubt the biggest and most painful part of the migration. A 15 year history of issue tracking reflects big shifts in programming styles styles that in turn determine what shows up in comments.

For example lots of XML was pasted in comments in the beginning, and Markdown treats that as [HTML blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#html-blocks) which results in the tags not showing at all. Of course if those were surrounded with `{code:xml}...{code}`, it would look fine, but in those days markup wasn't commonly used and the XML snippets showed up anyway, not forcing the issue, and consequently making it impossible to migrate properly.

There are lots of other intricacies such as the escaping of curly braces, to avoid the effect of monospacing, or the escaping of asterisks to prevent them from disappearing as markup for bold. I'll spare you the details. Suffice to say we put a lot of effort into making sure the quality of markup conversion is reasonably high.

One specific issue to highlight is the use of "@" in plain text (i.e. outside of code blocks). Those are user mentions on GitHub that trigger notifications. You might be surprised that [@Bean](https://github.com/bean), [@Configuration](https://github.com/configuration), [@Component](https://github.com/component) are actual GitHub users. First name references like @andy, @arjen, @brian colliding with GitHub user names were also common at some point, and all of those are a huge nuisance in an import of 17K+ issues with comments. This is why we've taken care to escape them. Going forward, when creating new issues or comments, please, be a good GitHub citizen and use backticks, e.g. `@Foo` (yes, <https://github.com/foo> does exist).

# Background

---

I've used and liked Jira for a long time. The idea of migrating to GitHub Issues did not come to me immediately. It seemed too basic by comparison. What turned me around completely has little to do with a feature-by-feature comparison, although I must admit GitHub Issues has really grown on me since the move. What I'm hinting at are larger forces at work.

GitHub is the home of just about every open source project, including *every* Spring project, and all users can be reasonably expected to have GitHub credentials. As a result it has become untenable today to expect developers to maintain a separate login for the issue tracker of every open source project they depend on or want to report an issue against.

Then there are the benefits of co-locating source code and issues. I've mentioned many of those earlier, like the [autolinked references](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/) across issues, pull requests, source code and commits, within a single project and across all projects on GitHub. The ability to mention and notify any GitHub user. All of those are very powerful benefits that are simply not possible with siloed issue tracking. I doubt anyone wants to go back to the days when open source projects were hosted in different places. The same is true for issue tracking.

There are deeper, less obvious benefits for co-located source code and issues. GitHub treats issues and pull requests as equal. They are assigned numbers from the same sequence. They look the same (description, comments, labels, and target milestone). They appear in release notes without distinction. A pull request is nothing but an issue with commits attached.

Historically in the Spring Framework, we've insisted on a Jira issue for every pull request. We didn't like the burden either but we needed a single place of record for all issues. As a consequence of this split situation, it was never too clear what should be discussed under the pull request and how much belongs in the Jira issue.

Going forward this is no longer a problem. We expect either an issue or a pull request, not both. If you need to start with a discussion first, which we *do* encourage, create an issue, and later, if you submit a pull request, the PR will supersede the issue. The two are linked still and nothing is lost. The conversation simply follows the action.

Not to be overlooked is the markup question. There is no doubt in my mind that Wiki markup is painful for code related discussions. I've used it for years on a daily basis. I'm used to it but some things are just hard, and require too much effort. Here is a reminder of what it takes to display something as common as curly braces and asterisks in code snippets:
`{{/endpoint/\{server-id\}/\{session-id\}/\{transport/\*\}}}`.

There is no question that Markdown is easier for code related comments. It requires less typing and it just works when it comes to formatting code because it's simpler and does not clash with symbols that commonly appear in code. This has looked obvious to me from the start, since I've also used GitHub and Markdown in parallel for years too. I never understood why Jira still doesn't support Markdown. To be clear this wasn't a decisive factor. It's just one of those things you learn to live with that later can become extra incentive for change.

Last but not least, today most developers use Spring through Spring Boot which has always used GitHub Issues. From that perspective alone, there is enough incentive for the Spring Framework to migrate, since Spring Boot isn't about to migrate to Jira, and that would be the only other way to create a more consistent experience for Spring users.

# The Actual Migration

---

Despite a lot of preparation there is nothing like the day of the actual migration. We used GitHub's unofficial [import API](https://gist.github.com/jonmagic/5282384165e0f86ef105) which is documented to not trigger any notifications. We hadn't noticed any problem with that during testing. Once the actual migration started, notifications for every issue and every comment started pouring in.

We began to reach out to GitHub support using every available channel available. Fortunately for us they noticed too. How could they not? By my estimate, the 2,600 issues that were imported before we pulled the breaks must have generated tens of millions of emails, not surprisingly causing notification disruptions.

A day later, after GitHub support had corrected the issues and turned off all notifications for the Spring Framework project to be on the safe side, we were onto a smoother path to importing all issues over the course of 8-9 hours. It took another few hours to make a second pass over all issues and comments, to replace Jira issue keys with GitHub reference numbers, and then several more days to check and clean up markup conversion issues.

All of that is now complete, and it is my pleasure to announce we are now open for business on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-12 04:16:26 UTC  ``` The fixes for the [CVE-2013-7315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7315) ([bug 1061509](show_bug.cgi?id=1061509 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-7315 Spring Framework: XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw")) and [CVE-2013-6429](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6429) ([bug 1053290](show_bug.cgi?id=1053290 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-6429 Spring Framework: XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw")) XML External Entity (XXE) issues were found to be incomplete. From the original advisory:  "Spring MVC's Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter also processed user provided XML and neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable them. Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter has been modified to provide an option to control the processing of XML external entities and that processing is now disabled by default."  This issue affects versions 3.0.0 to 3.2.8, and versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.1.  External References:  <http://www.gopivotal.com/security/cve-2014-0054>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-03-20 20:17:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. OpenShift Enterprise 1 is currently in the Production 1 phase of its lifecycle, as such this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Satellite Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/site/support/policy/updates/openshift> page.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c4)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:37:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss AM-Q 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c5)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-15 02:40:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0  Via RHSA-2014:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0400.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1075328#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2014-09-05 19:55:29 UTC  ``` This issue is being deferred for OpenShift Enterprise 2, only authenticated users have access to ActiveMQ (and thus the ability to exploit this Spring issue). A later update may address this issue.   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2014:0400 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.0.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

Security fixes:

A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

A flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional
authentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple
(unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have
enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)

It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-4152)

It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

It was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity
resolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE
attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
application server. (CVE-2013-6429)

The Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.
Applications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would
be rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting
(XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload
handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a
multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite
loop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

It was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues
in Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and
neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable
them, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.
(CVE-2014-0054)

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when
using Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the
action field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an
attacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored
the password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with
access to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to
gain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.
(CVE-2014-0085)

The CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and
Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035
issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security
Team, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of
Red Hat.

## Solution
