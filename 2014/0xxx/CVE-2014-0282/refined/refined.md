        "details": "The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML code demonstrates the use-after-free. It involves a form with several input elements, including text areas and a checkbox. The checkbox's `onpropertychange` event is used to call a function `changer()`.  The `changer()` function will be called inside the mshtml!CFormElement::DoReset call, after execution of this function crash in DoReset will happen when accessing freed CInput element.\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when the following steps are executed:\n\n1.  A checkbox is initially set to checked.  \n2. The `onpropertychange` event handler, `changer()`, is attached to the checkbox.\n3.  The `reset()` method of the form is called, which triggers the `DoReset` function.\n4. Inside `DoReset`, the `changer()` function is called.\n5. The `changer()` function clears the inner HTML of the form, causing the input elements, including CInput elements, to be freed.\n6. The `DoReset` function attempts to access a freed `CInput` element, resulting in a crash. The crash occurs at the memory address `00000000` when trying to perform an operation. Stack trace is provided showing calls leading up to the crash."

This could lead to memory corruption, allowing for arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.\n\nThe vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. This update is rated as Critical for Windows clients and Important for Windows servers, across different versions of IE (6-11). Several other memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer are addressed in the same bulletin (MS14-035)."
