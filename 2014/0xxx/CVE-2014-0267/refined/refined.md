  "CVE-2014-0267": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
    "root_cause": "Improper memory access by Internet Explorer when handling objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability and convince a user to view it.",
      "Compromised websites: An attacker could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content/advertisements.",
        "Email/instant messenger links: An attacker could convince users to click a malicious link in an email or instant message.",
      "Email attachments: An attacker could convince users to open a malicious email attachment."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject code into a website that a victim visits, or trick the user into opening a malicious file. The attacker also needs the ability to craft a malicious web page or file that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability."

  "CVE-2014-0268": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists within Internet Explorer during validation of local file installation and during secure creation of registry keys.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper permission validation."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, but it can be combined with another vulnerability that allows remote code execution.  For example, an attacker could exploit a remote code execution vulnerability to run code at low integrity level, then use this elevation of privilege vulnerability to gain medium integrity (user-level) permissions.",
