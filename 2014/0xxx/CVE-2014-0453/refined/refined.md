  "CVE-2014-0453": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the IcedTea JDK, the worst of which could lead to arbitrary code execution. A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, obtain sensitive information, bypass intended security policies, or have other unspecified impact. An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact. An Exception thrown by the Security component reveals information that an attacker could use to break RSA keys via a Bleichenbacher attack. An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and no availability impact.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause includes unspecified vulnerabilities related to the Security component in OpenJDK, including improper handling of RSA unpadding and incorrect processing of mlib/raster images.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "RSA unpadding timing issues",
      "incorrect mlib/raster image validation",
      "Insufficient access control, code injection vulnerabilities"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information, bypassing security policies, memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network access via untrusted Java applets or applications, or by a context-dependent attacker."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted requests or images to the vulnerable software or trick a user into running a malicious Java applet or application. Depending on the specific vulnerability, the attacker might need to be positioned remotely or locally."
