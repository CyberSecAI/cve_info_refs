Guideline 1:
The content is related to CVE-2014-0096.

Guideline 4:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The default servlet in Apache Tomcat allows web applications to define XSLTs for formatting directory listings. When running under a security manager, the processing of these XSLTs was not subject to the same constraints as the web application. This allowed a malicious application to bypass file access constraints via external XML entities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: XML External Entity (XXE) injection
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious application can read arbitrary files by bypassing security manager constraints by using external XML entities in the XSLTs. Also, can potentially access sensitive information by reading XML files belonging to other web applications deployed on same tomcat instance.
- Attack vectors: A malicious web application must be deployed on the Tomcat server and must define XSLT with XML External Entities.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to have the ability to deploy a malicious web application on vulnerable Tomcat server instance.
