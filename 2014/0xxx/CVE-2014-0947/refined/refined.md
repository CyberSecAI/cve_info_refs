- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'File->Import Profiles from Update Site' operation in Rational Software Architect Design Manager allows an authenticated user to provision an arbitrary update site into the Design Manager server code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of an authenticated user to import profiles from an arbitrary update site, effectively allowing them to inject malicious code or components into the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by provisioning malicious update sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'File->Import Profiles from Update Site' operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Rational Software Architect Design Manager.
