ICS Advisory
# Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-14-079-03

## OVERVIEW

This advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled “ICSA-14-079-03P Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities” that was posted to the US-CERT secure Portal library March 20, 2014.

Researchers working with HP’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), Andrea Micalizzi, aka rgod, Tom Gallagher, and an independent anonymous researcher, have identified several vulnerabilities in Advantech’s WebAccess application. ZDI reported them to NCCIC/ICS‑CERT. Advantech has produced a new version that mitigates these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Advantech WebAccess versions are affected:

WebAccess Version 7.1 and previous.

## IMPACT

An attacker may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code and view contents of files stored on the target machine.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Advantech is based in Taiwan and has distribution offices in 21 countries worldwide.

Advantech WebAccess, formerly known as BroadWin WebAccess, is a web-based SCADA and human-machine interface product used in energy, critical manufacturing, commercial facilities, and government facilities. These systems are deployed globally.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### SQL INJECTIONCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html, web site last accessed March  20, 2014.

An attacker using SQL injection may use arguments to construct queries without proper sanitization. The DBVisitor.dll is exposed through SOAP interfaces, and the exposed functions are vulnerable to SOAP injection. This may allow unexpected SQL action and access to records in the table of the software database or execution of arbitrary code.

### INFORMATION DISCLOSURECWE-538: File and Directory Information Exposure,  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/538.html, web site last accessed March  20, 2014.

The BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1 control contains a method named “OpenUrlToBuffer.” This method takes a URL as a parameter and returns its contents to the caller in JavaScript. The URLs are accessed in the security context of the current browser session. The control does not perform any URL validation and allows “file://” URLs that access the local disk.

The method can be used to open a URL (including file URLs) and read file URLs through JavaScript. This method could also be used to reach any arbitrary URL to which the browser has access.

CVE-2014-0771NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0771, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March  20, 2014.

### INFORMATION DISCLOSURECWE-538: File and Directory Information Exposure,  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/538.html, web site last accessed March 20, 2014.

The BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1 control contains a method named OpenUrlToBufferTimeout. This method takes a URL as a parameter and returns its contents to the caller in JavaScript. The URLs are accessed in the security context of the current browser session. The control does not perform any URL validation and allows file:// URLs that access the local disk.

The method can be used to open a URL (including file URLs) and read the URLs through JavaScript. This method could also be used to reach any arbitrary URL to which the browser has access.

CVE-2014-0772NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0772, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, web site last accessed March 20, 2014.

### COMMAND INJECTIONCWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'),  http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html, web site last accessed March 20, 2014.

The BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1 control contains a method named “CreateProcess.” This method contains validation to ensure an attacker cannot run arbitrary command lines. After validation, the values supplied in the HTML are passed to the Windows CreateProcessA API.

The validation can be bypassed allowing for running arbitrary command lines. The command line can specify running remote files (example: UNC command line).

A function exists at offset 100019B0 of bwocxrun.ocx. Inside this function, there are 3 calls to strstr to check the contents of the user specified command line. If “\setup.exe,” “\bwvbprt.exe,” or “\bwvbprtl.exe” are contained in the command line (strstr returns nonzero value), the command line passes validation and is then passed to CreateProcessA.

CVE-2014-0773NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0773, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B-Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([www.ics-cert.org](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
