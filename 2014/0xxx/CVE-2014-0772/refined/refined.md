The provided content is related to CVE-2014-0772.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1 control contains a method named `OpenUrlToBufferTimeout`. This method takes a URL as a parameter and returns its contents to the caller in JavaScript. The control does not perform any URL validation, allowing `file://` URLs to access the local disk.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- File and Directory Information Exposure (CWE-538). The `OpenUrlToBufferTimeout` method lacks URL validation, allowing access to local files via `file://` URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the `OpenUrlToBufferTimeout` method to read local files through JavaScript, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- The method can also be used to reach any arbitrary URL to which the browser has access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable method through JavaScript, specifying a file URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected application to send malicious requests. Remote access to the application is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
