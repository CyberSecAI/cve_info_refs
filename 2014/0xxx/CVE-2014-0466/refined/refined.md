Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-0466:

**Root Cause:**
The `fixps` script in `a2ps` does not invoke `gs` (Ghostscript) with the `-dSAFER` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `fixps` script, part of the `a2ps` package, processes PostScript files.
- The lack of the `-dSAFER` option when invoking `gs` allows PostScript files to perform actions outside their intended scope, such as file deletion or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious PostScript file, processed by `fixps`, could delete arbitrary files.
- It could also execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running `fixps`. This essentially grants an attacker the ability to control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious PostScript file.
- The attacker then entices a user to process this file using the vulnerable `fixps` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PostScript file to a user of `a2ps`.
- The attacker needs the user to execute `fixps` with the malicious file as input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `a2ps` prior to the fixes detailed in the provided documents.
- The `-dSAFER` option is a crucial security mechanism for Ghostscript, limiting the actions a PostScript file can take.
-  Multiple distributions have released fixes for this issue.
- This vulnerability has been assigned a "grave" severity rating by Debian.

The provided documents contain detailed information on the fix, including:
- Patches applied by Debian
- Affected and fixed versions for Debian, openSUSE and Gentoo.
- References to the original bug reports and security advisories.
- Confirmation of the fix with details in the changelogs.
