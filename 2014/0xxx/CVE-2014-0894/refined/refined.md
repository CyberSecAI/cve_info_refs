Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insecure disclosure of database credentials (username and password) in cleartext within the web application's communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Password Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application exposes the backend database credentials without any form of encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Direct Database Access:** Attackers can directly connect to the backend database using the disclosed credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate any data stored in the database, such as limits in the context of IBM Algorithmics RICOS. This could lead to significant financial risk management issues.
*   **Compromise of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The disclosure of credentials compromises both the confidentiality of the system's credentials and the integrity of its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic Interception:** By intercepting network traffic, attackers can access the cleartext database credentials. The application discloses the credentials during its normal communication, meaning that no special actions may be required from the attacker perspective to trigger the disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client (web application user) and the RICOS server to capture the credentials.
*   **Knowledge of Network Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to analyze the network requests to identify the database credentials being transmitted in cleartext.

**Additional Details (from Full Disclosure Mailing List):**

*   The specific vulnerable versions of IBM Algorithmics RICOS are 4.5.0 through 4.7.0.
*   The vulnerability is identified as PSIRT#1441 within IBM's internal tracking.
*   The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for this vulnerability is 3.5, which is considered medium severity.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
*   The specific vulnerable request is an HTTP POST request to `/ricos470/Executer`.
*   The credentials appear in the `<ObServer>` tag in the XML body of the request.
