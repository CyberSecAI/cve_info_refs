  "CVE-2014-0227": {
    "description": "It was possible to craft a malformed chunk as part of a chunked request that caused Tomcat to read part of the request body as a new request.",
    "root_cause": "Malformed chunk in a chunked request causing Tomcat to misinterpret part of the body as a new request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Request smuggling"
    ],
    "impact": "The server could process a crafted request with a malformed chunk as multiple requests, leading to request smuggling.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to Tomcat's HTTP endpoint is required",
     "Crafted HTTP request with a malformed chunked encoding"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send arbitrary requests with a controlled request body"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability can lead to request smuggling if the server is located behind a reverse proxy that does not correctly handle the malformed transfer-encoding header. A denial of service is also possible due to resource consumption if malformed data is repeatedly sent. Some sources mention the vulnerability as 'Limited DoS' due to the attacker's limited control over resource consumption and the fact that the thread gets freed when the request is processed. ",
