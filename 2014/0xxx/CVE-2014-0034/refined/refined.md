{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SecurityTokenService (STS) provided as part of Apache CXF will accept an invalid SAML token as valid if caching is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of SAML tokens"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use an invalid SAML token to gain unauthorized access to an application that uses STS for validation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted invalid SAML token to the SecurityTokenService"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the SecurityTokenService and have knowledge of how to craft an invalid SAML token accepted by the vulnerable service when caching is enabled.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is present when the STS is used to validate SAML tokens, and caching is enabled. This issue has been fixed in Apache CXF versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.9. Users are recommended to upgrade to CXF 2.6.14 or later, or 2.7.11 or later."
