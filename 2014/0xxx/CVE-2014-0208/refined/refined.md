  "CVE-2014-0208": {
    "description": "Stored XSS inside search auto-complete key names via parameters",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying autocomplete suggestions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute when a user uses the auto-complete search function, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker with the ability to create global parameters can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the 'name' or 'value' field of a parameter. When another user searches using the autocomplete function, the injected script will execute within the user's browser.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify global parameters to inject the malicious code."

  "CVE-2014-0007": {
    "description": "TFTP boot file fetch API permits remote code execution",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Smart Proxy's API for fetching files from installation media for TFTP boot files does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the command to fetch files, leading to command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insecure API"

      "impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the Smart Proxy server by injecting arbitrary commands into the API request.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/tftp/fetch_boot_file` endpoint, including malicious commands in the `path` parameter.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable Smart Proxy API endpoint. No authentication is mentioned, thus, the vulnerability may be remotely exploitable."
