Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-0989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow when parsing the `AccessCode2` parameter in a specially crafted HTML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow (CWE-119) when parsing the `AccessCode2` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the target machine.
- The attacker could cause the WebAccess application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file that exploits the vulnerable parsing of the `AccessCode2` parameter.
- The victim must be convinced to open the malicious HTML file. This can be achieved through social engineering, where the attacker may trick the victim into opening a file hosted on the local machine or on a website controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HTML file.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either by hosting it on a website or sending it as an email attachment.
- Social engineering is required to convince the user to open the malicious HTML file.
