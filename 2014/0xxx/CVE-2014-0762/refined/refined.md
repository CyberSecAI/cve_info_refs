- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the CG Automation Software DNP3 driver, used in the ePAQ-9410 Substation Gateway products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The DNP3 driver does not properly validate input, leading to an infinite loop and process crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - For serial-connected devices: An attacker can cause the software to go into an infinite loop, crashing the process and requiring a manual restart.
    - Impact to individual organizations depends on their specific environment.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - For serial-based: Local access to the serial-based outstation is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Serial-based: Attacker requires physical access to the serial interface of the device or social engineering to gain access.
