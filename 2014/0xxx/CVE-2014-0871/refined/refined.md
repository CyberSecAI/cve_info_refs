Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the disclosure of sensitive technical details within error messages generated by the Tomcat server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The Tomcat server reveals its version and other technical information in error messages. This behavior is not properly secured or sanitized, leading to unnecessary exposure of internal server details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gather valuable information about the environment of the IBM Algorithmics RICOS system.
- This information can then be used to plan further attacks or identify other potential vulnerabilities in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves accessing specific URLs that trigger error conditions that will display the sensitive information.
    - For example: `<https://ricos/ricos470/classes/>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (IBM Algorithmics RICOS).
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the information disclosure vulnerability, as the vulnerable endpoints are accessible without authorization.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided security advisory from SEC Consult gives a detailed proof of concept. Sending control characters as part of a cookie can also trigger a stack trace, revealing more about the server's inner workings.
- The advisory also indicates that this issue was assigned PSIRT#1440 and has a CVSS score of 4.3.
- It was discovered on 2013-12-19, and the fix was released on 2014-06-26 as part of patch ACLM 4.7.0.03 FP5.
- The vulnerability affects versions 4.5.0 to 4.7.0 of IBM Algorithmics RICOS.
