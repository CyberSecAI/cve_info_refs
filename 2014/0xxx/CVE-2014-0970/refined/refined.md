- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Link Injection vulnerabilities in the GDS component of IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows embedding links (URLs) to external sites or to different pages within the application, which can be manipulated by an attacker. These links may appear to be valid application links.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Navigation to unintended external websites.
    - Broken application functions.
    - Theft of user credentials and information by redirecting to fictitious login or profile pages.
- **Attack vectors**: Embedding malicious links (URLs) that appear to be valid application links. These links can redirect users to external sites or different pages within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to inject malicious links into the application. No specific capabilities/positions are mentioned.
