Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0470:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `super` program, when invoked with the `-F` flag and a custom configuration file, performs a `setuid(getuid())` call without checking for errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unchecked setuid:** The program attempts to set the user ID to the current user's ID using `setuid(getuid())` without verifying if the operation succeeds.
- **Race Condition:** On Linux kernels prior to fixes, an attacker can cause the setuid operation to fail by exhausting process limits (RLIMIT_NPROC).  If `setuid()` fails, the program continues execution as root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the `setuid()` call fails due to resource exhaustion (RLIMIT_NPROC), the `super` program continues to run with root privileges, allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local exploitation:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable `super` program is installed.
- **Command-line argument:** Exploitation involves invoking the `super` program with the `-F` flag and a custom configuration file.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Exploit involves using RLIMIT_NPROC on the 2.6 kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- **Ability to run `super`:** The attacker must be able to execute the `super` command.
- **Ability to Create Files:** The attacker must be able to create a configuration file to pass to the `-F` option.
- **Knowledge of resource limits:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate resource limits (specifically RLIMIT_NPROC) on vulnerable kernels.
