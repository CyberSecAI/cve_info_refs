- Attackers can gain full control of the affected system by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network access.
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted XML-RPC messages to the vulnerable SSCD code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network segment to exploit this vulnerability.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted XML-RPC messages to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal testing.
- There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
-  The Cisco Security Advisory provides fixed software versions for each affected product.
-  There are no workarounds available.
