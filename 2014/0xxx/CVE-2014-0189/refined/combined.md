Message-ID: <535DBA98.10101@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:19:04 +1000
From: Murray McAllister <mmcallis@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2014-0189:  /etc/sysconfig/virt-who is world-readable (contains
 unencrypted passwords)

Good morning,

Not sure if anyone else is using <https://fedorahosted.org/virt-who/>

It was reported that "/etc/sysconfig/virt-who" is world-readable and
contains plaintext passwords to connect to various hypervisors. A local
attacker could use this flaw to obtain those passwords and gain access
to the hypervisors. (CVE-2014-0189)

Red Hat would like to thank Sal Castiglione for reporting this issue.

Discussions about fixing the issue are ongoing:

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c0)  Jayaram Alla    2014-03-27 01:40:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem: We have customers pointing that they cannot add the unencrypted administrative credentials in "/etc/sysconfig/virt-who".This is in thee case of registering the system using Virtual data center subscription.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): virt-who Subscription-Manager  How reproducible: Anytime  Actual results: direct credentials of the administors need to be provided  virt-who config file which the customer is feeling risky.  Expected results: There should be a provision of providing the credentials in encrypted form if possible. else should show any other way to provide the details.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c1)  Jayaram Alla    2014-03-27 01:48:32 UTC  ``` I have 2 customers reported the above concern for whom i have advised to use RHN Classic as we dont have such functionality as of now. Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know if there is any alternate solution for this.  Below article may give you more idea    "Using RHEL subscriptions (2013 packaging): Scenario 5 - Virtual Datacenter "   >> <https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/480693>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c3)  Jayaram Alla    2014-03-28 16:49:43 UTC  ``` Here are some more requested inputs from the customer.   > - business justification i.e list the business requirements  Only admin servers/desktops have access to vCenter. So Red Hat must provide a way to register RHEL guests on third party hypervisors without requiring VMs to have admin access to vCenter (the current girt-who stuff is just defective by design) Registration/enrollement must be automatic (no need to go on the RedHat support website and assign enrolments for each an every VM)  > - do you have specific timeline dependencies?  No specific timeline dependencies.  > - would you be able to assist in testing this functionality if implemented?  Sure   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c5)  Radek Novacek    2014-04-15 11:11:11 UTC  ``` Hi, my current plan is following:  1) try to figure out, if virt-who could be used without administrator privileges on vCenter. Would it be OK for customer to have credentials for some non-admin user stored unencrypted in virt-who config file?  2) if not, add some possibility to encrypt the password that is supplied in the config file. I don't see any possibility how make the password storage secure but we can try to make it harder to read, but it will just be security through obscurity.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c6)  Yogendra Jog    2014-05-05 13:42:30 UTC  ``` This is kind of roundrobbin.  CU's need to use virt-who to register the RHEL guest installed on VMware-ESX or Hyper-V.  CU cannot do that as their company security policy does not allow them to mention passwords in "clear text" in virt-who config which is an administrative user.    Though I have seen another case where read only user may also work ? There is no alternate method to achieve this & customers are getting frustrated.  Case - 01066127 where customer has 5 QTY of SKU RH00002 Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Virtual Datacenters, Standard, which cannot be fully utilized because of this issue.  Regards Yogendra.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c8)  Radek Novacek    2014-05-19 12:06:34 UTC  ``` So, is following solution acceptable for you:  Have some utility that will ask you for your password and will return encoded string. You will place this encoded string to virt-who config file.  On the background there will be file with the encryption key somewhere on the disk only accessible by root.  There is no added security in this approach, anyone with the root access will still be able to get your password, but the password won't be stored in plaintext in the configuration file.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c10)  Sal Castiglione    2014-05-30 15:19:28 UTC  ``` That sounds like a better interim solution, than having the password saved as cleartext, along with having the permissions of the virt-who config file default to 600 instead of 644 ?  Also - I found another bug with the girt-who service:  If the password being used ends with an & character as the 3rd to last, the service fails as it’s being interpreted as a command.  For example, if the password is:  12345abcde&F1 when trying to start/stop the service, it will return /etc/sysconfig/virt-who: line 44: F!: command not found  -Sal   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c11)  Radek Novacek    2014-06-02 06:34:12 UTC  ``` Config file permissions will be changed to 600.  The behavior with ampersand in the password is expected. The /etc/sysconfig/virt-who file is read as a shell script that sets some environmental variables. The password should be quoted, e.g.  VIRTWHO_ESX_PASSWORD='12345abcde&F1'   I'll add note that this could happen.  Thanks for noticing.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c12)  Radek Novacek    2014-06-06 12:08:25 UTC  ``` This bug is fixed upstream and will be resolved by rebase of virt-who, see [bug 1002640](show_bug.cgi?id=1002640).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c13)  Radek Novacek    2014-06-18 07:34:03 UTC  ``` This is already implemented, removing FutureFeature keyword.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c14)  Radek Novacek    2014-06-18 13:49:06 UTC  ``` This bug is fixed by rebase to virt-who-0.10-1.el6.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286#c16)  Liushihui    2014-07-28 06:46:41 UTC  ``` Verify it on virt-who-0.10-3.el6.noarch.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-17 04:43:08 UTC  ``` It was reported that "/etc/sysconfig/virt-who" is world-readable and contains plaintext passwords to connect to various hypervisors. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain those passwords and gain access to the hypervisors.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c4)  Radek Novacek    2014-04-17 06:27:19 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report. [Bug 1081286](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286 "CLOSED ERRATA - [RFE] Cannot add unencrypted administrative credentials of Vcenter in \"/etc/sysconfig/virt-who\"") is also complaint about having unencrypted passwords in world-readable files.  I'll make the file root readable only, but is it enough? I don't see any solution how virt-who can unencrypt password from configuration file.  Virt-who has to operate unattended, so asking for password is not an option. If virt-who has encrypting key somewhere (disk, source code) what will prevent attacker to read it anyway? It would be just security through obscurity.  I'm open to suggestions how to fix it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-24 05:37:16 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sal Castiglione for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c8)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-28 02:11:58 UTC  ``` Public already via [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1081286](show_bug.cgi?id=1081286 "CLOSED ERRATA - [RFE] Cannot add unencrypted administrative credentials of Vcenter in \"/etc/sysconfig/virt-who\"")   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c16)  Radek Novacek    2015-01-26 12:28:49 UTC  ``` Again, this bug is not about plain text versus encrypted passwords, but about wrong permissions for file with passwords.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2015-01-26 20:41:59 UTC  ``` This issue was already addressed in the virt-who updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.11) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6) by changing permissions of the /etc/sysconfig/virt-who configuration file to 600, i.e. making the file only readable to the administrative user.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-1206.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-1513.html>  Similar change is expected to be included in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2015-01-26 21:22:33 UTC  ```  Created virt-who tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1186034](show_bug.cgi?id=1186034 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0189 virt-who: plaintext hypervisor passwords in world-readable /etc/sysconfig/virt-who configuration file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1088732#c20)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-15 03:23:57 UTC  ``` virt-who-0.8-11.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0430)

## Topic

An updated virt-who package that fixes one security issue, several bugs,
and adds various enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The virt-who package provides an agent that collects information about
virtual guests present in the system and reports them to the
subscription manager.

It was discovered that the /etc/sysconfig/virt-who configuration file,
which may contain hypervisor authentication credentials, was
world-readable. A local user could use this flaw to obtain authentication
credentials from this file. (CVE-2014-0189)

Red Hat would like to thank Sal Castiglione for reporting this issue.

The virt-who package has been upgraded to upstream version 0.11, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
The most notable bug fixes and enhancements include:

* Support for remote libvirt.
* A fix for using encrypted passwords.
* Bug fixes and enhancements that increase the stability of virt-who.

(BZ#1122489)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the virt-who agent failed to read the list of

virtual guests provided by the VDSM daemon. As a consequence, when in VDSM
mode, the virt-who agent was not able to send updates about virtual guests
to Subscription Asset Manager (SAM) and Red Hat Satellite. With this
update, the agent reads the list of guests when in VDSM mode correctly and
reports to SAM and Satellite as expected. (BZ#1153405)

* Previously, virt-who used incorrect information when connecting to Red

Hat Satellite 5. Consequently, virt-who could not connect to Red Hat
Satellite 5 servers. The incorrect parameter has been corrected, and
virt-who can now successfully connect to Red Hat Satellite 5. (BZ#1158859)

* Prior to this update, virt-who did not decode the hexadecimal

representation of a password before decrypting it. As a consequence, the
decrypted password did not match the original password, and attempts to
connect using the password failed. virt-who has been updated to decode the
encrypted password and, as a result, virt-who now handles storing
credentials using encrypted passwords as expected. (BZ#1161607)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* With this update, virt-who is able to read the list of guests from a

remote libvirt hypervisor. (BZ#1127965)

Users of virt-who are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
corrects these issues and adds these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
