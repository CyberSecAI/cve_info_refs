Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The configuration file `/etc/sysconfig/virt-who` was world-readable and contained plaintext passwords used to connect to hypervisors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The configuration file had overly permissive file permissions, allowing any local user to read it.
- **Plaintext Passwords:**  Hypervisor passwords were stored in plaintext within the configuration file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker could read the configuration file, extract the plaintext passwords, and gain unauthorized access to the hypervisors.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the `virt-who` agent is running and where `/etc/sysconfig/virt-who` exists.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was reported by Sal Castiglione.
- The fix involved changing the permissions of the configuration file to 600, making it only readable by the root user.
- A utility was proposed to generate an encoded password string for the configuration file, however, it was considered security through obscurity since the encryption key would need to be stored locally.
- The issue was fixed in virt-who version 0.10-1.el6 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and virt-who-0.11-1.el7 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
- This vulnerability was addressed by Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2015:0430.
- This was addressed by changing the permissions of /etc/sysconfig/virt-who to 600.
- The vulnerability was present in `/etc/sysconfig/virt-who` configuration file.
