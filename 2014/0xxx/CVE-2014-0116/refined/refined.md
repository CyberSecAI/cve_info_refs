Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0116:

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-0116 is a vulnerability in Apache Struts2 related to the CookieInterceptor. It allows attackers to manipulate Struts' internal state via crafted cookie parameters, potentially leading to changes in session or request data. The vulnerability arises from insufficient exclusion patterns in the CookieInterceptor, which can be bypassed to access and modify internal objects.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the inadequate parameter exclusion mechanism within the CookieInterceptor. The original fix intended to block access to the `getClass()` method, but it did not cover all attack vectors. This allowed malicious users to manipulate internal Struts objects through specially crafted cookie names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization of cookie parameters
- Inadequate exclusion patterns in CookieInterceptor
- Ability to manipulate internal state of session, request, etc.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to the modification of session data, request parameters, and other internal state information of the Struts application.
- In certain scenarios, it might permit file disclosure, denial-of-service (DoS), or remote command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends specially crafted cookie names within HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly required for the initial exploit but may be necessary for full impact.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Struts 2 versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.16.3.
- The fix is included in Struts version 2.3.20, which includes same exclude patterns as ParametersInterceptor.
- A workaround is to avoid using wildcard mapping for cookie names or implement a custom `CookieInterceptor` until upgrading.
- Huawei also acknowledged the vulnerability in their products and released fixes, also referencing the Apache advisory.

The information provided by the Huawei advisory provides additional context, specifically noting that the vulnerability allows bypassing previous patches for CVE-2014-0050 and CVE-2014-0094.
