Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in a regression introduced by a previous fix in Apache Tomcat that handles path parameters. Specifically, when `disableURLRewriting` was set to `true`, Tomcat was still parsing session IDs from the URL, effectively ignoring the intended setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a **session fixation** issue. Tomcat was not properly honoring the `disableURLRewriting` configuration option, thus leading to an exposure to session fixation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful attack could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack a user's session, as the session ID could be influenced by the attacker even when URL rewriting was supposed to be disabled. This means the attacker could potentially gain access to a user's account or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a session ID, which the vulnerable version of Tomcat would incorrectly process even if URL rewriting was disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or influence user requests, typically a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker also needs to be aware of the vulnerable configuration (Tomcat with `disableURLRewriting` enabled). They would then need to convince the user to use a crafted URL with a session ID parameter.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Apache Tomcat versions 6.0.33 through 6.0.37.
- The fix involves ensuring that session IDs are not parsed from URLs for contexts where `disableURLRewriting` is set to `true`.
- The vulnerability is described as "Low" in some contexts, "Moderate" in others, indicating a varying severity depending on the platform and deployment.
-  The issue is related to the fix for path parameter handling, specifically revision [1149220](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1149220) which introduced the regression.
- The fix for this is in revision [1558822](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1558822).
- Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2130-1 indicates that this issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
- IBM also issued security bulletins related to this CVE, mentioning Rational Lifecycle Adapter for HP ALM and QRadar Security Information and Event Manager as affected by this vulnerability in their Tomcat instances.
