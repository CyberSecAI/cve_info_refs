Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the presence of multiple shell command injection flaws in OpenShift. This is due to unsanitized data being passed directly into shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Shell Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is shell command injection. Input data isn't sanitized and is directly used in shell commands, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution as root. The provided data indicates this has been demonstrated via (authenticated) mcollective commands.
*   Potential for other attack vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **mcollective commands:** Authenticated mcollective commands can be used as a vector to execute arbitrary code.
*   Other potential attack vectors are possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Shell access to the broker node:** According to comment #2, the issue is only exploitable if the attacker has shell access to the broker node.
*   **Authentication:** Exploitation via mcollective commands requires authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The severity of the issue was initially classified as critical, but later downgraded to important because the vulnerability is less easily exploitable in a properly configured environment.
*   The vulnerability affects systems where the broker and node are on the same host, or where untrusted users have access to broker servers (unsupported configurations).
*   The affected versions of `rubygem-openshift-origin-node` are shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.
*   A future update may address this issue.
