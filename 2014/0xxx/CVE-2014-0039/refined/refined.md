  "Root cause of vulnerability": "fwsnort, when run as a non-root user, would load the fwsnort.conf file from the current working directory if no configuration file was explicitly specified.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Untrusted search path vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by loading a malicious fwsnort.conf configuration file.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local users, attacker-controlled directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create a malicious fwsnort.conf file in the current working directory where fwsnort is executed."
