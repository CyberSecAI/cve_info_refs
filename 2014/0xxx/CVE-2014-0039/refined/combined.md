# CVE-2014-0039: fwsnort loaded configuration file from cwd when run as a non-root user

---

*From*: Murray McAllister <mmcallis () redhat com>

*Date*: Mon, 03 Feb 2014 10:58:22 +1100

```
Good morning,

When fwsnort was run as a non-root user, it opened the fwsnort.conf file
from the current working directory if a configuration file was not
explicitly specified. The configuration file can specify a directory to
load libraries from, so this would have been an issue if running fwsnort
in an attacker-controlled directory.

Michael Rash has released fwsnort-1.6.4 to fix this issue:

<http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwsnort/download/>
<https://github.com/mrash/fwsnort/blob/master/ChangeLog>

The patch (with further issue details) for CVE-2014-0039 is:

<https://github.com/mrash/fwsnort/commit/fa977453120cc48e1654f373311f9cac468d3348>

For the affected versions, I had only tested 1.6.3 (on Fedora and EPEL).

Cheers,

--

Bug fix for vulnerability [CVE-2014-0039](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-275q-7vvp-w66m "CVE-2014-0039") reported by Murray McAllister of
the Red Hat Security Team in which an attacker-controlled fwsnort.conf
file could be read by fwsnort when not running as root.  This was caused
by fwsnort reading './fwsnort.conf' when not running as root and when a
path to the config file was not explicitly set with -c on the command
line.  This behavior has been changed to require the user to specify a
path to fwsnort.conf with -c when not running as root.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

fwsnort-1.6.8 (07/31/2018): - Update to handle the 'metadata' keyword in the Snort rules language. This restores the ability to translate the Emerging Threats rule sets and beyond. - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.7 (05/06/2017): - Bug fix reported independently by Dan Alberghetti and fixed by Axel Beckert in github issue #14 to strip out brackets from single port numbers in Snort rules when they exist. - Updated IPTables::Parse to 1.6.1. - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.6 (12/04/2016): - (Robert Foreman) Whitelist IP addresses for Emerging Threats ruleset downloads (96.43.137.99, 204.12.217.19). - Update to IPTables::Parse-1.6 which contains a fix for a local-only vulnerability dealing with temporary file handling. Details can be found here: https://github.com/mrash/IPTables-Parse/blob/master/Changes - Fixed an issue for Snort rules against all IP protocols should be translated with the iptables '-p all' argument instead of '-p ip'. This issue was reported by Github user mgaulton. - Added support for using the 'ip' command for acquiring IP addresses assigned to local interfaces. The 'ifconfig' command is still supported, but 'ip' is preferred when it is available. Issue #9 reported by 'mgaulton'. - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.5 (08/26/2014): - (Paulo Bruck) Submitted a patch to fix a bug in fwsnort usage of the iptables --ulog-prefix option (an invalid quote was being used previous to the fix). - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.4 (02/02/2014): - Bug fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-0039 reported by Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Team in which an attacker-controlled fwsnort.conf file could be read by fwsnort when not running as root. This was caused by fwsnort reading './fwsnort.conf' when not running as root and when a path to the config file was not explicitly set with -c on the command line. This behavior has been changed to require the user to specify a path to fwsnort.conf with -c when not running as root. - Switch fwsnort.sh iptables-restore exec() strategy to leverage 'cat' against fwsnort.save file (fixes CentOS deployments). - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.3 (12/21/2012): - Bug fix to ensure that !, <, >, and = chars in content strings are converted to the appropriate hex equivalents. All content strings with characters outside of [A-Za-z0-9] are now converted to hex-string format in their entirety. This should also fix an issue that results in the following error when running /var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh:
 Using intrapositioned negation (`--option ! this`) is deprecated in favor of extrapositioned (`! --option this`). Bad argument `bm' Error occurred at line: 64 Try `iptables-restore -h' or 'iptables-restore --help' for more information. Done.
 - Bug fix to set default max string length in --no-ipt-test mode where iptables capabilities are not tested. - (Andrew Merenbach) Bug fix to properly honor --exclude-regex filtering option. - Added fwsnort test suite to the test/ directory. This mimics the test suites from the psad and fwknop projects, and it designed to examine many of the run time results of fwsnort. - Added the ability to easily revert the fwsnort policy back to the original iptables policy with "/var/lib/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh -r". Note that this reverts back to the policy as it was when fwsnort itself was executed. - Implemented a single unified function for iptables match parameter length testing, and optimized to drastically reduce run time for iptables capabilities checks (going from over 20 seconds to less than one second in some cases). - (Dwight Davis) Contributed patches for several bugs including not handling --exclude-regex properly, not ignoring the deleted.rules file, not handling --strict mode operations correctly, and more. These issues and the corresponding patch were originally reported here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=693000 - Bug fix for Snort rules with HOME\_NET(any) -> EXTERNAL\_NET(any) to ensure they go into the OUTPUT chain instead of the INPUT chain. This bug was reported by Dwight Davis. - Updated to bundle the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6.2 (04/28/2012): - Switched --no-ipt-sync to default to not syncing with the iptables policy. By default fwsnort attempts to match translated Snort rules to the running iptables policy, but this is tough to do well because iptables policies can be complex. And, before fwsnort switched to the iptables-save format for instantiating the policy, a large set of translated rules could take a really long time to make active within the kernel. Finally, many Snort rules restrict themselves to established TCP connections anyway, and if a restrictive policy doesn't allow connections to get into the established state for some port let's say, then there is little harm in having translated Snort rules for this port. Some kernel memory would be wasted (small), but no performance would be lost since packets won't be processed against these rules anyway. The end result is that the default behavior is now to not sync with the local iptables policy in favor of translating and instantiating as many rules as possible. - Replaced Net::IPv4Addr with the excellent NetAddr::IP module which has comprehensive support for IPv6 address network parsing and comparisons. - Moved the fwsnort.sh script and associated files into the /var/lib/fwsnort/ directory. This was suggested by Peter Vrabec. - Bug fix for recent versions of iptables (such as 1.4.12) where the icmp match requires --icmp-type to be set - some Snort rules look for a string to match in icmp traffic, but don't also specify an icmp type. - Bug fix for 'qw(...) usage as parenthesis' warnings for perl > 5.14 - Removed the ExtUtils::MakeMaker RPM build requirement from the fwsnort.spec file. This is a compromise which will allow the fwsnort RPM to be built even if RPM dosen't or can't see that ExtUtils::MakeMaker is installed - most likely it will build anyway. If it doesn't, there are bigger problems since fwsnort is written in perl. If you want to build the fwsnort RPM with a .spec file that requires ExtUtils::MakeMaker, then use the "fwsnort-require-makemaker.spec" file that is bundled in the fwsnort sources.
fwsnort-1.6.1 (11/01/2011): - (Kim Hagen) submitted a patch for a bug in fwsnort-1.6 where the fwsnort policy in iptables-save format could not be loaded whenever iptables-save put the nat table output after the filter table output. In this case, fwsnort would fail with an error like the following:
 Couldn't load target `FWSNORT\_FORWARD\_ESTAB':/lib/xtables/libipt\_FWSNORT\_FORWARD\_ESTAB.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 fwsnort now invokes 'iptables-save -t filter' in order to ensure that ordering issues do not affect how fwsnort builds its translated rule set. - Bug fix to ensure that fwsnort does not attempt to re-order pattern matches for patterns that have a relative match requirement. For non- relative matches fwsnort re-orders pattern matches based on the pattern length, reasoning that the longest pattern should be processed first for better performance. The usage of the fast\_pattern keyword give the user explicit control over this. Here is a Snort rule that is now properly handled by fwsnort (references removed):
 alert tcp $EXTERNAL\_NET $HTTP\_PORTS -> $HOME\_NET any (msg:"ET WEB\_CLIENT Possible Adobe Reader and Acrobat Forms Data Format Remote Security Bypass Attempt"; flow:established,to\_client; file\_data; content:"%FDF-"; depth:300; content:"/F(JavaScript|3a|"; nocase; distance:0; classtype:attempted-user; sid:2010664; rev:8;)
 Before this change, fwsnort translated this rule as:
 $IPTABLES -A FWSNORT\_FORWARD\_ESTAB -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -m string --hex-string "/F(JavaScript|3a|" --algo bm --from 69 --icase -m string --hex-string "%FDF|2d|" --algo bm --to 364 -m comment --comment "sid:2010664; msg:ET WEB\_CLIENT Possible Adobe Reader and Acrobat Forms Data Format Remote Security Bypass Attempt; classtype:attempted-user; rev:8; FWS:1.6;" -j LOG --log-ip-options --log-tcp-options --log-prefix "SID2010664 ESTAB "
 Note that in the above rule, the "/F(JavaScript|3a|" pattern was switched to be evaluated first even though it is a relative match to the previous pattern in the original Snort rule. After this change, fwsnort translates this rule as:
 $IPTABLES -A FWSNORT\_FORWARD\_ESTAB -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -m string --hex-string "%FDF|2d|" --algo bm --to 364 -m string --hex-string "/F(JavaScript|3a|" --algo bm --from 69 --icase -m comment --comment "sid:2010664; msg:ET WEB\_CLIENT Possible Adobe Reader and Acrobat Forms Data Format Remote Security Bypass Attempt; classtype:attempted-user; rev:8; FWS:1.6;" -j LOG --log-ip-options --log-tcp-options --log-prefix "SID2010664 ESTAB "
 - Updated to the latest Emerging Threats rule set.
fwsnort-1.6 (07/28/2011): - Fixed the --ipt-apply functionality - the variable that held the fwsnort.sh path was not initialized properly prior to this change. - Added the --Conntrack-state argument to specify a conntrack state in place of the "established" state that commonly accompanies the Snort "flow" keyword. By default, fwsnort uses the conntrack state of "ESTABLISHED" for this. In certain corner cases, it might be useful to use "ESTABLISHED,RELATED" instead to apply application layer inspection to things like ICMP port unreachable messages that are responses to real attempted communications. (Need to add UDP tracking for the \_ESTAB chains for this too - coming soon.) - Recent releases of iptables and the Linux kernel support matching on connection state via the conntrack modules and the --ctstate switch. Added a capabilities test for this, and will fall back to using the state match if the conntrack module is not available. - Bugfix to ensure the iptables log prefixes built by fwsnort are not longer than those allowed by the running iptables firewall. This is usually a total of 29 characters, but fwsnort now dynamically figures out this value. - Bugfix for --ipt-list and --ipt-flush to ensure that the proper iptables binary path is chosen. These args failed without this because the iptables binary was not set.
fwsnort-1.5 (01/08/2011): - Major update to use the iptables-save format instead of the older strategy of always just executing iptables commands directly (which was very flow for large fwsnort policies). The /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh script now just executes:
 /sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.save
 All fwsnort rules are now placed in the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.save file, but the older fwsnort.sh output (for the individual commands version) is still available at /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort\_iptcmds.sh. This functionality extends to ip6tables policies as well. The fwsnort man page explain this in better detail:
 "As of fwsnort-1.5 all iptables rules built by fwsnort are written out to the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.save file in iptables-save format. This allows a long fwsnort policy (which may contain thousands of iptables rules translated from a large Snort signature set) to be quickly instantiated via the "iptables-restore" command. A wrapper script /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh is also written out to make this easy. Hence, the typical work flow for fwsnort is to: 1) run fwsnort, 2) note the Snort rules that fwsnort was able to successfully translate (the number of such rules is printed to stdout), and then 3) execute the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh wrapper script to instantiate the policy in the running kernel."
 - Added the --rules-url argument so that the URL for updating the Emerging Threats rule set can be specified from the command line. The default is:
 http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/emerging-all.rules
 - Updated to automatically check for the maximum length string that the string match supports, and this is used to through out any Snort rules with content matches longer than this length. - Updated the iptables capabilities testing routines to add and delete testing rules to/from the custom chain 'FWS\_CAP\_TEST'. This maintains a a cleaner separation between fwsnort and any existing iptables policy even during the capabilities testing phase. - Added the --ipt-check-capabilities argument to have fwsnort test the capabilities of the local iptables firewall and exit. - Added the --string-match-alg argument to allow the string matching algorithm used by fwsnort to be specified from the command line. The default algorithm is 'bm' for 'Boyer-Moore', but 'kmp' may also be specified (short for the 'Knuth–Morris–Pratt' algorithm). - Updated to the latest complete rule set from Emerging Threats (see http://www.emergingthreats.net/).
fwsnort-1.1 (01/05/2010): - Added the ability to build an fwsnort policy that utilizes ip6tables instead of iptables. This allows fwsnort filtering and altering capabilities to apply to IPv6 traffic instead of just IPv4 traffic. To enable ip6tables usage, use the "-6" or "--ip6tables" command line arguments. - Added the --include-perl-triggers command line argument so that translated Snort rules can easily be tested. This argument instructs fwsnort to include 'perl -e print ... ' commands as comments in the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh script, and these commands can be combined with netcat to send payloads across the wire that match Snort rules. - Updated fwsnort to create logs in the /var/log/fwsnort/ directory instead of directly in the /var/log/ directory. The path is controlled by a new variable 'LOG\_FILE' in the /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf file. - Added several variables in /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.conf to control paths to everything from the config file to the snort rules path. Coupled with this is the ability to create variables within path components and fwsnort will expand them (e.g. 'CONF\_DIR /etc/fwsnort; CONF\_FILE $CONF\_DIR/fwsnort.conf'). - Added --Last-cmd arg so that it is easy to rebuild the fwsnort.sh script with the same command line args as the previous execution.
fwsnort-1.0.6 (05/30/2009): - (Franck Joncourt) Updated fwsnort to use the "! <option> <arg>" syntax instead of the older "<option> ! <arg>" for the iptables command line. - (Franck Joncourt) For the --hex-string and --string matches, if the argument exceeds 128 bytes (iptables 1.4.2) then iptables fails with an error "iptables v1.4.2: STRING too long". Fixes this with a patch that adds a new variable in fwsnort.conf "MAX\_STRING\_LEN", so that the size of the content can be limited. If the content (null terminated string) is more than MAX\_STRING\_LEN chars, fwsnort throws the rule away. - Bug fix to allow fwsnort to properly translate snort rules that have "content" fields with embedded escaped semicolons (e.g. "\;"). This allows fwsnort to translate about 58 additional rules from the Emerging Threats rule set. - Bug fix to allow case insensitive matches to work properly with the --include-re-caseless and --exclude-re-caseless arguments. - Bug fix to move the 'rawbytes' keyword to the list of keywords that are ignored since iptables does a raw match anyway as it doesn't run any preprocessors in the Snort sense. - Added the --snort-rfile argument so that a specific Snort rules file (or list of files separated by commas) is parsed. - Added a small hack to choose the first port from a port list until the iptables 'multiport' match is supported. - Updated to consolidate spaces in hex matches in the fwsnort.sh script since the spaces are not part of patterns to be searched anyway. - Updated to the latest complete rule set from Emerging Threats (see http://www.emergingthreats.net/). - Added the "fwsnort-nobuildreqs.spec" file for building fwsnort on systems (such as Debian) that do not install/upgrade software via RPM. This file omits the "BuildRequires: perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker" directive, and this fixes errors like the following on an Ubuntu system when building fwsnort with rpmbuild:
 rpm: To install rpm packages on Debian systems, use alien. See README.Debian. error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - No such file or directory (2) error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
fwsnort-1.0.5 (08/21/2008): - Replaced the bleeding-all.rules file with the emerging-all.rules file. This is because Matt Jonkman now releases his rule sets at http://www.emergingthreats.net/ - Restructured perl module paths to make it easy to introduce a "nodeps" distribution of fwsnort that does not contain any perl modules. This allows better integration with systems that already have all necessary modules installed (including the IPTables::ChainMgr and IPTables::Parse modules). The main driver for this work is to make all cipherdyne.org projects easily integrated with distributions based on Debian, and Franck Joncourt has been instrumental in making this process a reality. All perl modules are now placed within the "deps" directory, and the install.pl script checks to see if this directory exists - a separate fwsnort-nodeps-<ver> tarball will be distributed without this directory. The Debian package for fwsnort can then reference the -nodeps tarball, and a new "fwsnort-nodeps.spec" file has been added to build an RPM from the fwsnort sources that does not install any perl modules. - Updated to import perl modules from /usr/lib/fwsnort, but only if this path actually exists in the filesystem. This is similar to the strategy implemented by psad. A new variable FWSNORT\_LIBS\_DIR was added to the fwsnort.conf to support this. - Added support for multiple Snort rule directories as a comma-separated list for the argument to --snort-rdir. - Moved 'threshold' to the unsupported list since there will be several signatures that use this feature to detect the Dan Kaminsky DNS attack, and fwsnort does not yet support the usage of the iptables --limit match.
fwsnort-1.0.4 (01/22/2008): - (Grant Ferley) Submitted patch to exclude loopback interfaces from iptables allow rules parsing. This behavior can be reversed with the existing --no-exclude-loopback command line argument. - (Grant Ferley) Submitted patch to IPTables::Parse to take into account iptables policy output that contains "0" instead of "all" to represent any protocol. - (Grant Ferley) Submitted patch to IPTables::Parse to set sport and dport to '0:0' if the protocol is 'all'. - Bugfix to allow negated networks to be specified within iptables allow rules or within the fwsnort.conf file. - Updated install.pl to set the LC\_ALL environmental variable to "C". This should fix potential locale problems (this fix was borrowed from the fwknop project).
fwsnort-1.0.3 (11/22/2007): - Added --include-re-caseless and --exclude-re-caseless options to have --include-regex and --exclude-regex options match case insensitively. - Major signature update from Bleeding Threats. This update includes a large number of new signatures with PCRE statements, with an emphasis on detecting SQL injection attacks directed at internal webservers from external sources. - Added the ability to interpret PCRE statements that include simple string matches separated by ".\*" and ".+" as multiple iptables string matches. The only negative consequence in terms of signature detection is that ordering is not preserved; that is, the PCRE "/UNION.+SELECT/" would only match a packet that contains "UNION" followed by "SELECT", whereas an iptables rule that uses a string match for UNION and a separate string match for SELECT would match a packet that contains both strings but in reverse. Typically this is not a huge concern, and the PCRE translation can be disabled with a new option --no-pcre. - Added asn1 keyword to unsupported list.
fwsnort-1.0.2 (08/26/2007): - Bugfix to make sure to add in header lengths for depth and offset values since the string match extension compares bytes from the start of the data link header.
fwsnort-1.0.1 (08/26/2007): - Bugfix for ipt\_rule\_test() function name. - Added the ability to automatically resolve command paths if any commands cannot be found at the locations specified in the fwsnort.conf file.
fwsnort-1.0 (04/19/2007): - Major update to include support for the NFQUEUE and QUEUE targets with new command line options --NFQUEUE and --QUEUE. This changes the default LOG target to the NFQUEUE or QUEUE targets instead, and at the same time builds a parallel Snort rule set in the /etc/fwsnort/snort\_rules\_queue directory. Every Snort rule in this directory has at least one "content" keyword, which fwsnort uses in the resulting iptables policy. This policy only sends those packets to snort\_inline via the NFQUEUE or QUEUE target that match a content field within some Snort rule. The end result is that snort\_inline should run faster because the vast majority of packets (which are not malicious) are processed via the Linux kernel without ever having to be sent to userspace for analysis. There is a tradeoff here in terms of attack detection; snort\_inline does not receive all packets associated with a stream, so it cannot detect attacks quite as effectively (snort\_inline does not have an opportunity to look at reassembled buffers). However, this trade off may be acceptable for large sites where performance is more important. - Bug fix to remove any existing jump rules from the built-in INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains before creating a new jump rules. This allows the fwsnort.sh script to be executed multiple times without creating a new jump rule into the fwsnort chains for each execution. - Added the -X command line argument to allow fwsnort to delete all of the fwsnort chains; this emulates the iptables command line argument of the same name. - Minor output enhancements and bugfixes to give more insight into the translation process. For example, if fwsnort is run in --snort-sid mode but is unable to translate the specified signatures, the user is notified. Also, any existing /etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh script is not archived and erased until fwsnort is actually going to write a new one. - Added sid values to iptables comment match string. - Bugfix for iptables string match --from and --to values to skip past packet headers. This is an approximation until a new --payload option can be added to the string match extension. - Added a single iptables rule testing API internally within fwsnort; this adds a measure of consistency and removes some duplicate code. - Added fwsnort mailing list at SourceForge.
fwsnort-0.9.0 (03/22/2007): - Added support for multiple content matches since this is supported by iptables. This made a 10% increase in the fwsnort translation rate - about 60% of all Snort-2.3.3 rules can be translated now. - Added emulation for distance and within from previous content match based on --from and --to (string match extension) and the length of the previous pattern. - Added the ability to include the Snort "msg", "classtype", "reference", "priority", and "rev" fields in each iptables rule with the comment match. This can be disabled with a new command line argument --no-ipt-comments. The fwsnort version is also included within this string. - Added the ability to include the iptables rule number for each rule in the fwsnort chains. This is useful to easily know which iptables rule is being triggered by network traffic (so it can be disabled if necessary). This can be disabled with --no-ipt-rule-nums. - Added the --include-regex and --exclude-regex command line arguments. These arguments allow rules to be included/excluded based on a regular expression supplied on the command line. - Updated to include the original Snort rule as a comment within the fwsnort.sh script without having to use --verbose. - Bugfix to force install of IPTables::Parse since it had been updated in the fwsnort-0.8.2 release. - Changed the IGNORE\_ADDR variable to WHITELIST since this name better describes the actual function of this var. Updated to allow multiple WHITELIST lines. - Added the BLACKLIST variable to allow a true blacklist to be instantiated with either the DROP or REJECT targets. The syntax for the BLACKLIST variable is "BLACKLIST <ip or network> <target>", where "target" is either "DROP" or "REJECT". - Added -F and -L command line arguments to flush and list iptables rules. This is similar to the iptables command line args of the same names. - Bugfix to ensure that traffic directed into the INPUT or coming from the OUTPUT chains is treated as going toward or originating from the HOME\_NET. After all the HOME\_NET variable may contain an internal network but omit the IP assigned to an external interface on the firewall. - Added "--log-ip-options" and "--log-tcp-options" to fwsnort LOG rules by default (in the generated fwsnort.sh script). This can be disabled with --no-log-ip-opts and --no-log-tcp-opts arguments on the fwsnort command line. - Added the ability to include --log-tcp-sequence to LOG rules in fwsnort.sh with a new argument --ipt-log-tcp-seq on the fwsnort command line. - Updated to handle negative string matches with "--string ! <string>". - Updated to output all unsupported options of the /var/log/fwsnort.log file to assist in the development of addition keyword emulation.
fwsnort-0.8.2 (02/17/2007): - Updated to newer IPTables::Parse module that uses the array of hash references method of returning iptables policy data. - Added --Dump-ipt and --Dump-snort rules to allow iptables policy and Snort rules to be dumped to STDOUT. - Added bleeding-all.rules file from http://www.bleedingsnort.com/ - Added patches/bm\_goodshift\_fix.patch patch file that fixes an initialization bug in the Boyer-Moore text search implementation in the kernel (linux-2.6.x/lib/ts\_bm.c) which caused slightly repetitive patterns to only match at specific offsets with the string match extension. - Bugfix to ensure that a depth cannot be less that an offset (these translate to the --to and --from command line arguments to iptables). - Bugfix to escape '$' chars in iptables search strings. - Added cd\_rpmbuilder to make it easy to automatically build RPM files of fwsnort. - Added support for the iptables OUTPUT chain. - Added the ChangeLog.svn file so that all of the changed files and corresponding svn commit messages can be viewed (this file is built from release to release).
fwsnort-0.8.1 (11/11/2005): - Updated to use the string match extension "--algo bm" argument if fwsnort is being run on a 2.6.14 (or greater) kernel. - Updated to handle the Snort "offset" and "depth" keywords via the --from and --to options to the string match extension in the 2.6.14 kernel. - Created RPM package of fwsnort. - Minor man page updates.
fwsnort-0.8.0 (07/11/2005): - Completely re-structured fwsnort w.r.t. how it creates Netfilter chains. There are no longer any per-interface chains (this greatly simplifies the Netfilter chains). - Added three new chains "FWSNORT\_INPUT\_ESTAB", "FWSNORT\_OUTPUT\_ESTAB" and "FWSNORT\_FORWARD\_ESTAB" to which tcp connections in the ESTABLISHED state are jumped. This allows fwsnort to use the Netfilter tcp connection tracking mechanism to ignore Stick and Snot style attacks (similar to the flow:established Snort rule option). - Added true variable resolution (i.e. HTTP\_SERVERS -> HOME\_NET -> any) for the Snort rule header. This directly emulates the behavior of the Snort IDS. - Added IP protocol support in the translation of the Snort rule header. The Snort rule translation rate is now at about 53% for Snort-2.3. - Bugfix for ipopts Snort option (several arguments are not supported by the ipv4options extension). - Better tests for Netfiler TTL, TOS, and ipv4options matches. - Replaced IGNORE\_IP and IGNORE\_NET keywords with single IGNORE\_ADDR keywork in fwsnort.conf. - Updated to correctly handle ICMP type and code rules (itype and icode Snort options) via the "--icmp-types type/code" convention. - Added support for emulating the dsize Snort option through the use of the Netfilter length match. - Changed --type argument to --include-types and added list support so it accepts things like "chat,ddos". Also added --exclude-types command line argument. - Added support for multiple sid's (as a comma separated list) in --snort-sids argument. Also added --exclude-sids argument to remove a list of sids from translation. - Added support for the replace Snort option (originally from the Snort\_inline project). The requires the replace string patch. - Added support for restricting jump rules to a list of interfaces via the --restrict-intf argument. - Added kernel patch to extend the maximum packet length that the string match extension will attempt to search from 1024 bytes to 2048 bytes (requires a kernel re-compile of course). - Added DRP and REJ strings to logging prefix if --ipt-drop or --ipt-reject is specified. - Added snortspoof.pl, which is a simple perl script that emulates the Stick and Snot tools.
fwsnort-0.7.0 (06/05/2005): - Added support for the Snort pass action by using the ACCEPT target. - Added support for the Snort log action by using the ULOG target (which can then log the packet via the pcap writer). - Added support for all fwsnort alerts to be logged via the ULOG target instead of the LOG target. - Added support for the "resp" keyword to allow it to drive the Netfilter argument to the REJECT target. - Added "pcre" to the unsupported list... this knocks the fwsnort translation rate down to about 50% for Snort-2.3 rules (pcre is heavily utilized). - Added "priority" and "rev" to comment lines.
fwsnort-0.6.5 (03/20/2005): - Updated to not attempt to download Snort rules from snort.org because the rules are no longer available for automatic downloads - Changed the install.pl script and the --update-rules mode for fwsnort to download the latest signature set from http://www.bleedingsnort.com/. (Snort.org is now offering pay-service around their rule sets). - Added signature test for the "flowbits" keyword.
fwsnort-0.6.4 (12/18/2004): - Updated to Snort-2.3 rules. FWSnort can convert a total of 1710 out of 2559 total Snort-2.3 rules. - Updated to new Snort rules download link for --update-rules mode: http://www.snort.org/dl/rules/snortrules-snapshot-CURRENT.tar.gz - Updated to standard [+], [-], and [\*] prefixes for info, warning and die logging messages. - Added --replace-string patches.
fwsnort-0.6.3 (04/04/2004): - Added ignore functionality for both IPs and networks - Split --ipt-block into --ipt-drop and --ipt-reject to add DROP or REJECT rules respectively. - Added --add-deleted option to allow rules in the "deleted.rules" file to be added.
fwsnort-0.6.2 (03/19/2004): - Added --internal-net and --dmz-net options so that internal and dmz networks can be manually specified without having to parse the output of ifconfig. This is most useful for running fwsnort on a linux system that is acting as a bridge where no ip addresses are assigned to the interfaces. - Bugfix for missing icmp-port-unreachable rejects for UDP packets.
fwsnort-0.6.1 (02/01/2004): - Bugfix for not adding dmz interface rules to INPUT chain. - Bugfix for not getting the DMZ interface network.
fwsnort-0.6 (01/04/2004): - Speed increase and disk access decrease by writing iptables commands to the iptables script only after all lines have been generated. - Bugfix for DMZ interface. - Bugfix for multiple ip\_proto fields. - Removed the ip protocol as an allowed protocol for translation. - Bugfix for negated port numbers. - Removed "<-" rule direction since not even snort supports this. - Fixed snort rule updates from snort.org.
fwsnort-0.5 (12/21/2003): - Added "-j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset" for tcp sessions if the --ipt-block option is specified. - Added ability to download latest snort rules from snort.org. - Added --no-ipt-jumps. - Added better checking for iptables build characteristics such as the LOG target and wether or not the ipv4options extension is compiled in. - Added config preservation code from psad in install.pl.
