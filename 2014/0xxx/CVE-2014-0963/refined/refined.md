Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0963:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the handling of certain SSL messages within the TLS implementation of IBM products using the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit). This issue arises during specific error cases that cause a single thread to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of SSL messages, particularly in error conditions.
- Thread looping, leading to excessive CPU utilization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Rapid increase in CPU utilization.
- Potential CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the affected system.
- Denial of service, affecting the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks exploiting the SSL/TLS protocol.
- Specifically, sending crafted SSL messages that trigger the vulnerable error condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker.
- No authentication required.
- Moderate exploit complexity.

**Affected Products (from different documents):**
- IBM Security Network Protection System (XGS) models 3100, 4100, 5100. Firmware versions: 5.1, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.2.1, 5.2
- IBM Security Access Manager for Web, all versions 7.0 and 8.0 (including software and appliance)
- IBM HTTP Server (affects all WebSphere Application Server versions 8.5, 8, 7)
- IBM Security SiteProtector System versions 2.9, 3.0, and 3.1

**Additional Notes:**
- Some documents mention that monitoring CPU utilization is a way to detect if the system is being affected.
- One of the documents mentions a workaround for ISAM for Web: enabling SSLv3 and disabling all versions of TLS.
- The vulnerability does not impact system confidentiality or integrity, only availability.
- The fix involves applying specific hotfixes/fix packs to the affected products/versions.
- The vulnerability is related to a looping thread and not a buffer overflow.
