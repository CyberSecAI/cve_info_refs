# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Network Protection System CPU Utilization (CVE-2014-0963)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Security Network Protection System is affected by a problem related to the SSL implementation which, under very specific conditions, can cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-0963](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Security Network Protection System is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM Security Network Protection System and other software running on the affected system.

## Affected Products and Versions

**Products:** IBM Security *Network Protection*(XGS**)** models 3100, 4100, 5100

**Firmware versions**: 5.1, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.2.1, 5.2

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM has provided patches for all affected versions. Follow the installation instructions in the README files included with the patch.

* 5.1.0.0-ISS-XGS-All-Models-Hotfix-FP0011 for IBM Security Network Protection products at version 5.1<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/doSelectFixes?options.selectedFixes=5.1.0.0-ISS-XGS-All-Models-Hotfix-FP0011&continue=1>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Access Manager for Web High CPU utilization (CVE-2014-0963)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The Reverse Proxy component in all versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Web is affected by a problem in which, under very specific conditions, CPU utilization can rapidly increase and not decrease. This issue is related to the SSL implementation in IBM Security Access Manager (ISAM) for Web.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:**

## Affected Products and Versions

* All versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Web, both software and appliance: 7.0, 8.0

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM has provided patches for all affected versions. Follow the installation instructions in the README files included with the patch.

| Affected Version | Build | APAR | Download URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISAM for Web 7.0 | 7006 | IV59660 | [7.0.0-ISS-SAM-IF0006](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Access+Manager+for+e-business&release=7.0.0&platform=All&function=all) |
| ISAM for Web 8.0 | 80032 | IV59660 | [8.0.0.3-ISS-WGA-IF0002](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Security%2BSystems&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Access+Manager+for+e-business&release=8.0.0.1&platform=All&function=all) |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Methods for ISAM for Web 7.0 software version**

**Method One**: Monitor CPU utilization of your WebSEAL instances. If utilization becomes abnormally high, stop and restart the affected instance.

**Method Two:** Enable SSLv3 and disable all versions of TLS used by WebSEAL. To do this, perform these steps for every WebSEAL instance in your environment:

1. In the [ssl] stanza of the WebSEAL instance configuration file, enable SSLv3 by setting the following parameter:

    `disable-ssl-v3 = no`
2. In the [ssl] stanza of the WebSEAL instance configuration file, disable all versions of TLS by setting every parameter that starts with "disable-tls" to "yes"
3. Restart the WebSEAL instance

**Methods for all ISAM for Web appliance versions**

**Method One**: Monitor CPU utilization of your ISAM for Web appliance. From the Monitor main menu item, select System Graphs | CPU. If utilization becomes abnormally high, stop and restart all Reverse Proxy instances.

**Method Two:** Enable SSLv3 and disable all versions of TLS used by each Reverse Proxy instance. To do this, perform these steps for every Reverse Proxy instance in your environment:

1. In the [ssl] stanza of the Reverse Proxy instance configuration file, enable SSLv3 by setting the following parameter:

    `disable-ssl-v3 = no`
2. In the [ssl] stanza of the Reverse Proxy configuration file, disable all versions of TLS by setting every parameter that starts with "disable-tls" to "yes"
3. Save your changes and deploy.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.
