  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-0057",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an unsafe invocation of the 'send' method in the ServiceController of Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME). User-supplied input was not properly sanitized before being used in a `self.send` call.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Unsafe use of method dispatch ('send' method)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could invoke arbitrary methods on the controller, including private methods, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system with the privileges of the application.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attacker sends malicious input in the 'pressed' parameter to the ServiceController, which is then used to invoke a method via `self.send`."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with specific values for the 'pressed' parameter. No specific authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided context but it is implied that some degree of access to the application is required."
