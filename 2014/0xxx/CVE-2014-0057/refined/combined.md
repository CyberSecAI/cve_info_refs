| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 20:41:07 UTC  ``` Aaron Patterson of the Ruby on Rails project reports:  There is an XSS vulnerability in the number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and number_to_human helpers in Ruby on Rails.   Versions Affected:  All. Fixed Versions:     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.  Impact ------ These helpers allows users to nicely format a numeric value. Some of the parameters to the helper (format, negative_format and units) are not escaped correctly. Application which pass user controlled data as one of these parameters are vulnerable to an XSS attack.  All users passing user controlled data to these parameters of the number helpers should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863436](attachment.cgi?id=863436&action=diff "3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863436&action=edit "3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch") 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863437](attachment.cgi?id=863437&action=diff "4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863437&action=edit "4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch") 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863438](attachment.cgi?id=863438&action=diff "4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863438&action=edit "4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch") 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-15 04:41:28 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting this issue.

## Synopsis

Critical: cfme security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0215)

## Topic

Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments, which are far more complex than physical ones. This
technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures
to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization
deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Ruby parsed floating point
numbers from their text representation. If an application using Ruby
accepted untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the application
to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
application. (CVE-2013-4164)

It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly
sanitize user-supplied values in the ServiceController. A remote attacker
could invoke arbitrary method calls in the application controller that, due
to a lack of sanitization, could allow access to private methods that could
possibly allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
(CVE-2014-0057)

It was found that several number conversion helpers in Action View did not
properly escape all their parameters. An attacker could use these flaws to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user as parameters to the affected helpers.
(CVE-2014-0081)

A memory consumption issue was discovered in the text rendering component
of Action View. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
of service attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in
the creation of Ruby symbols that were never garbage collected.
(CVE-2014-0082)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting
CVE-2014-0081 and CVE-2014-0082. Upstream acknowledges Kevin Reintjes as
the original reporter of CVE-2014-0081, and Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the
original reporter of CVE-2014-0082. The CVE-2014-0057 issue was discovered
by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

This update fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
CloudForms 3.0 Management Engine 5.2 Technical Notes linked to in the
References section.

All users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-12 05:40:49 UTC  ``` Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team reports:  CFME contains an unsafe invocation of send method on user-supplied argument. This issue is reported by Brakeman as problem in ServiceController method x_button:  vmdb/app/controllers/service_controller.rb  16 def x_button 17 @explorer = true 18 model, action = pressed2model_action(params[:pressed]) 19 @sb[:action] = action 20 if ["ownership","tag"].include?(action) 21 self.send(params[:pressed],"Service") 22 else 23 self.send(params[:pressed]) 24 end  Assuming pressed2model_action sanitizes user input, this look like false-positive. However, pressed2model_action does not do sanitization, and only splits string on underscore:  def pressed2model_action(pressed) pressed =~ /^(vm_vdi|miq_template)_(.*)$/ ? [$1, $2] : pressed.split('_', 2) end  If action parsed from user-supplied input is neither "ownership", nor "tag", else branch is executed and client can execute arbitrary method on controller, including private.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c3)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-24 18:58:03 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-11 16:59:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CloudForms Management Engine 5.x  Via RHSA-2014:0215 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0215.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-12 05:40:49 UTC  ``` Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team reports:  CFME contains an unsafe invocation of send method on user-supplied argument. This issue is reported by Brakeman as problem in ServiceController method x_button:  vmdb/app/controllers/service_controller.rb  16 def x_button 17 @explorer = true 18 model, action = pressed2model_action(params[:pressed]) 19 @sb[:action] = action 20 if ["ownership","tag"].include?(action) 21 self.send(params[:pressed],"Service") 22 else 23 self.send(params[:pressed]) 24 end  Assuming pressed2model_action sanitizes user input, this look like false-positive. However, pressed2model_action does not do sanitization, and only splits string on underscore:  def pressed2model_action(pressed) pressed =~ /^(vm_vdi|miq_template)_(.*)$/ ? [$1, $2] : pressed.split('_', 2) end  If action parsed from user-supplied input is neither "ownership", nor "tag", else branch is executed and client can execute arbitrary method on controller, including private.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c3)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-24 18:58:03 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1064140#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-11 16:59:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CloudForms Management Engine 5.x  Via RHSA-2014:0215 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0215.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
