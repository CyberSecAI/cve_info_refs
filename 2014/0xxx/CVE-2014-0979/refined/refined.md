Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `lightdm-gtk-greeter` application incorrectly uses the `lightdm-gobject` API. Specifically, it does not handle the case where `lightdm_greeter_get_authentication_user()` returns `NULL`. This occurs when the username from the previous authentication attempt is invalid (e.g., empty).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability lies in the `start_authentication()` function within `lightdm-gtk-greeter`. When `lightdm_greeter_get_authentication_user()` returns `NULL`, the code attempts to dereference this `NULL` pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a local denial-of-service condition.
*   **Greeter Crash:** The `lightdm-gtk-greeter` application crashes.
*   **LightDM Daemon Exit:** When the greeter crashes, the lightdm daemon exits, requiring administrator intervention to restart. This effectively prevents users from logging in.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack is local and can be triggered by any unprivileged user.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker needs to provide an empty or invalid username. The specific mechanism isn't detailed, but it is implied to be via the greeter's input mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Basic User Privileges:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability. They only need to interact with the login screen.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report on Launchpad includes a patch which addresses the issue by checking for a NULL username, and is included in the 1.7.1 release of the greeter.
*   The OpenSUSE security update also includes a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   The issue was discovered through code analysis and triggered by providing an empty username.

In summary, this vulnerability is a straightforward NULL pointer dereference that can be triggered by a local, unprivileged attacker, resulting in a denial-of-service that disrupts system login. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of a NULL return value from the lightdm API when an invalid username is provided.
