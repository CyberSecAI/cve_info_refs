Core Security - Corelabs Advisory
<http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/>

Android WiFi-Direct Denial of Service

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Android WiFi-Direct Denial of Service
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0002
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/android-wifi-direct-denial-service>
Date published: 2015-01-26
Date of last update: 2015-01-26
Vendors contacted: Android Security Team
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Uncaught Exception [CWE-248]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0997

3. *Vulnerability Description*

   Some Android devices are affected by a Denial of Service attack when
   scanning for WiFi Direct devices.

   An attacker could send a specially crafted 802.11 Probe Response frame
   causing the Dalvik subsystem to reboot because of an Unhandle Exception
   on WiFiMonitor class.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . Nexus 5 - Android 4.4.4
   . Nexus 4 - Android 4.4.4
   . LG D806 - Android 4.2.2
   . Samsung SM-T310 - Android 4.2.2
   . Motorola RAZR HD - Android 4.1.2

   Other devices could be also affected.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Android 5.0.1
   . Android 5.0.2

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

   Some mitigation actions may be to avoid using WiFi-Direct or update
to a non-vulnerable Android version.
   Contact vendor for further information.

7. *Credits*

   This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Andres Blanco
from the CoreLabs
   Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by the Core
Advisories
   Team.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

   Android makes use of a modified *wpa_supplicant*[1]
   in order to provide an interface between the wireless driver and the
Android platform framework.

   Below the function that handles *wpa_supplicant* events. This function
   returns a jstring from calling NewStringUTF method.

/-----
    static jstring android_net_wifi_waitForEvent(JNIEnv* env, jobject)
    {
        char buf[EVENT_BUF_SIZE];
        int nread = ::wifi_wait_for_event(buf, sizeof buf);
        if (nread > 0) {
            return env->NewStringUTF(buf);
        } else {
        return NULL;
        }
    }
-----/

   The WiFi-Direct specification defines the P2P discovery procedure to
enable P2P
   devices to exchange device information, the device name is part of
this information.

   The WifiP2pDevice class, located at
/wifi/java/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pDevice.java,
   represents a Wi-Fi p2p device. The constructor method receives the
string provided by
   the *wpa_supplicant* and throws an IllegalArgumentException in case
   the event is malformed.

   Below partial content of the WiFiP2PDevice.java file.

   On some Android devices when processing a probe response frame with a
WiFi-Direct(P2P)
   information element that contains a device name attribute with
specific bytes generates
   a malformed supplicant event string that ends up throwing the
IllegalArgumentException.
   As this exception is not handled the Android system restarts.

Android WiFi-Direct Denial of Service

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Android WiFi-Direct Denial of Service
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0002
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/android-wifi-direct-denial-service
Date published: 2015-01-26
Date of last update: 2015-01-26
Vendors contacted: Android Security Team
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Uncaught Exception [CWE-248]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0997

3. *Vulnerability Description*

  Some Android devices are affected by a Denial of Service attack when
  scanning for WiFi Direct devices.

  An attacker could send a specially crafted 802.11 Probe Response frame
  causing the Dalvik subsystem to reboot because of an Unhandle Exception
  on WiFiMonitor class.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

  . Nexus 5 - Android 4.4.4
  . Nexus 4 - Android 4.4.4
  . LG D806 - Android 4.2.2
  . Samsung SM-T310 - Android 4.2.2
  . Motorola RAZR HD - Android 4.1.2

  Other devices could be also affected.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

  . Android 5.0.1
  . Android 5.0.2

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

  Some mitigation actions may be to avoid using WiFi-Direct or update
to a non-vulnerable Android version.
  Contact vendor for further information.

7. *Credits*

  This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Andres Blanco
from the CoreLabs
  Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by the Core
Advisories
  Team.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

  Android makes use of a modified *wpa_supplicant*[1]
  in order to provide an interface between the wireless driver and the
Android platform framework.

  Below the function that handles *wpa_supplicant* events. This function
  returns a jstring from calling NewStringUTF method.

/-----
   static jstring android_net_wifi_waitForEvent(JNIEnv* env, jobject)
   {
       char buf[EVENT_BUF_SIZE];
       int nread = ::wifi_wait_for_event(buf, sizeof buf);
       if (nread > 0) {
           return env->NewStringUTF(buf);
       } else {
       return NULL;
       }
   }
-----/

  The WiFi-Direct specification defines the P2P discovery procedure to
enable P2P
  devices to exchange device information, the device name is part of
this information.

  The WifiP2pDevice class, located at
/wifi/java/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pDevice.java,
  represents a Wi-Fi p2p device. The constructor method receives the
string provided by
  the *wpa_supplicant* and throws an IllegalArgumentException in case
  the event is malformed.

  Below partial content of the WiFiP2PDevice.java file.

  On some Android devices when processing a probe response frame with a
WiFi-Direct(P2P)
  information element that contains a device name attribute with
specific bytes generates
  a malformed supplicant event string that ends up throwing the
IllegalArgumentException.
  As this exception is not handled the Android system restarts.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
