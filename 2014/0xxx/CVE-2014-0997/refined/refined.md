  "cve": "CVE-2014-0997",
  "description": "Some Android devices are affected by a Denial of Service attack when scanning for WiFi Direct devices. An attacker could send a specially crafted 802.11 Probe Response frame causing the Dalvik subsystem to reboot because of an Unhandle Exception on WiFiMonitor class.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Android devices handle specially crafted 802.11 Probe Response frames during WiFi Direct scanning. Specifically, a malformed device name attribute within the P2P information element of the probe response leads to an uncaught exception.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncaught Exception [CWE-248]",
      "Malformed input handling in WifiP2pDevice constructor"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. The Dalvik subsystem reboots due to an unhandled IllegalArgumentException, causing the Android system to restart.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends a specially crafted 802.11 Probe Response frame containing a malformed device name in the WiFi-Direct (P2P) information element.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted 802.11 frames within range of a vulnerable device. They also need to know the target's MAC address.",
    "poc": "The provided Python script generates a malicious probe response with a crafted device name designed to trigger the vulnerability."
