{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-0089",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The 500 error page was vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper handling of error messages. Additionally, bookmarks could be saved with HTML in their names, which, when rendered, would cause a 500 error, leading to the execution of the HTML in the browser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper output sanitization of error messages.",
        "Insufficient input validation for bookmark names."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into a bookmark name. When a user accesses the bookmark list, the injected code would execute in their browser, potentially leading to data exposure or other malicious actions. Furthermore, the 500 error page was also vulnerable, causing any HTML embedded within a generated error to be executed as well.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An authenticated user adds a bookmark containing malicious code in the bookmark name.",
       "A crafted bookmark name causes a 500 error, triggering the XSS on the error page."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Foreman application with the ability to create bookmarks. They do not need to be an administrator.  Also, the attacker needs to craft a malicious payload."
