Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0324:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from memory corruption within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is that incorrect memory access leads to memory corruption. This occurs during the processing of objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system within the security context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system. They could then install programs, manipulate data, or create new accounts with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:**
    *   An attacker hosts a malicious website specifically crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious website via email, instant message, or other means.
    *   The malicious website uses specially crafted content to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability within Internet Explorer when the page is viewed.
    *   Attackers may also leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to host a website with the malicious content.
*   They need to entice the user to visit this website using social engineering or other methods.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of memory corruption issues addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-012.
*   The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to correct the underlying issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
*   Mitigating factors include running Internet Explorer in Enhanced Security Configuration, which is enabled by default on Windows Servers. Also, using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) to manage security mitigation can hinder exploitation.
*   Workarounds involved disabling ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting or setting security zones to "High" in Internet Explorer.
*   Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks exploiting this vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8.
