Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2014-0203:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `__do_follow_link` function in `fs/namei.c` of the Linux kernel does not properly set the `nd->last_type` variable to `LAST_BIND` when handling certain filesystems, specifically when dealing with autofs direct mounts. This results in an incorrect value being left over from finding the parent directory (`LAST_NORM`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `nd->last_type` variable during path traversal, leading to incorrect assumptions about the last component type in the path.
- Insufficient validation or handling of the mount point type by the kernel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Slab corruption: The incorrect `nd->last_type` value leads to excessive calls to `putname()`, causing memory corruption in the kernel's slab allocator.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The slab corruption manifests as a kernel BUG (system crash) during operations involving the affected mount points.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: A local user can trigger the vulnerability by opening a path involving an autofs direct mount. For example, using a command like `open("/mnt/tmp", O_CREAT)` where `/mnt/tmp` is such a mount.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code locally.
- No specific privileges required for exploitation, but it should be noted that exploitation leads to a kernel crash which typically requires elevated privileges to cause intentionally and be considered a security issue.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user tries to open a file on a path that is an autofs direct mount, specifically when a mount point's type is not correctly determined, leading to a kernel crash.
- The fix involves ensuring that `nd->last_type` is set to `LAST_BIND` before the `follow_link()` function is called, which is necessary for direct mounts and normal symlinks.
- The issue was discovered and reported by Vladimir Davydov of Parallels.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `86acdca1b63e6890540fa19495cfc708beff3d8b` in the Linux kernel repository.
