DETAILS OF THE SECURITY UPDATES

The Rich Text Editor in previous versions of Movable Type 6 and Movable Type 5 are susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  A remote attacker can inject JavaScript into a page or entry in a Movable Type blog or website.  This JavaScript can be executed on the client browser when that page or entry is subsequently displayed in the Rich Text Editor.

These vulnerabilities were reported by a member of the Movable Type community, and were kept confidential until the release of the updated versions of Movable Type.

5.2.9 is to be found at

<http://www.movabletype.jp/downloads/stable/>

# Movable Type 6.0.1, 5.2.9, and 5.161 Released to Close Security Vulnerabilities

By [Dave Aiello](https://movabletype.org/news/../author/dave-aiello/)

Posted November 15, 2013, in [News](https://movabletype.org/news/news/).

We are releasing Movable Type 6.0.1, 5.2.9, and 5.161 as mandatory security updates. Â These updates resolve multiple security-related issues discovered in all previous versions of Movable Type 6 and Movable Type 5.

### Details of the Security Updates

The Rich Text Editor in previous versions of Movable Type 6 and Movable Type 5 are susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Â A remote attacker can inject JavaScript into a page or entry in a Movable Type blog or website. Â This JavaScript can be executed on the client browser when that page or entry is subsequently displayed in the Rich Text Editor.

These vulnerabilities were reported by a member of the Movable Type community, and were kept confidential until the release of the updated versions of Movable Type.

### Affected Versions of Movable Type

* Movable Type Pro 6.0
* Movable Type Pro 5.2.x, 5.1x, 5.0x
* Movable Type Open Source (MTOS) 5.2.x, 5.1x, 5.0x
* Movable Type Advanced / Movable Type Enterprise 5.2.x, 5.1x, 5.0x

### Steps Required to Close the Security Vulnerabilities

Please upgrade to the latest versions of Movable Type:

* Movable Type Pro 6.0.1
* Movable Type Pro 5.2.9
* Movable Type Pro 5.161
* Movable Type Open Source 5.2.9
* Movable Type Open Source 5.161
* Movable Type Advanced / Movable Type Enterprise 5.2.9
* Movable Type Advanced / Movable Type EnterpriseÂ 5.161

### Versions That Are Not Affected

* Movable Type Advanced 6
* Movable Type Enterprise 6

Movable Type Enterprise has not yet been released for Version 6.

### Warnings

* **Movable Type 5.0x has reached End of Life and is no longer supported.** Â For users that are running any version of 5.0, please upgrade to Movable Type 5.2.9, which is available at no additional charge to paid licensees of Movable Type 5 or users of Movable Type Open Source.
* **Movable Type 4.38 will reach End of Life on December 31, 2013.** Â Users of Movable Type 4.38 and earlier versions are urged to immediately begin planning for an upgrade to Movable Type 5.2.9 or Movable Type 6.0.1 if you wish to continue to have access to security fixes.

### Non-Security Issues Fixed in These Releases

[110748](https://movabletype.fogbugz.com/default.asp?110748): [CMS] [Listing] An error occurs when an administrator attempts to delete all members of a website or blog

### Availability of Updated Versions of Movable Type

Movable Type Pro 6.01, Movable Type Pro, Advanced, and Enterprise 5.2.9 and 5.161 are available through the [Movable Type Software Repository Server](https://mtuser.sixapart.jp/en/). Â That server is located atÂ <https://mtuser.sixapart.jp/en/>.

Movable Type Open Source 5.2.9 and 5.161 are available on request. Â Instructions will be posted on November 18, 2013, or shortly thereafter.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE Request: cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in movable type 6.0.1, 5.2.9, and 5.161

---

*From*: Salvatore Bonaccorso <carnil () debian org>

*Date*: Mon, 6 Jan 2014 06:49:04 +0100

```
Hi

A movable type update to 6.0.1, 5.29 and 5.161 fixes cross-site
scripting attacks, from the announcement:

```
> ```
> The Rich Text Editor in previous versions of Movable Type 6 and
> Movable Type 5 are susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
> A remote attacker can inject JavaScript into a page or entry in a
> Movable Type blog or website. This JavaScript can be executed on the
> client browser when that page or entry is subsequently displayed in
> the Rich Text Editor.
>
> These vulnerabilities were reported by a member of the Movable Type
> community, and were kept confidential until the release of the updated
> versions of Movable Type.
>
> ```

```

 [0]  <http://movabletype.org/news/2013/11/movable_type_601_529_and_5161_released_to_close_security_vul.html>

Looking trough the git repository at [1], there is at least [2] which
seems to indicate the fix for the 5.2.x branch (I cannot say tough if
this the complete one).

 [1] <https://github.com/movabletype/movabletype>
 [2] <https://github.com/movabletype/movabletype/commit/c85903b3ee23ea2b4ddf981a75815c737f6f6040>

Debian Bugtracker reference is at [3].

 [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/734304>

Is there enough information to identify the vulnerability and to get a
CVE assigned for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
