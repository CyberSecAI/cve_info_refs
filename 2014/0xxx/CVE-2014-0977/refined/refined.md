Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Rich Text Editor of Movable Type blogging engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Rich Text Editor. This is a classic XSS vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject and execute JavaScript code on the client's browser when the affected page or entry is displayed. This malicious JavaScript can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** Potentially taking over user accounts.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or downloading malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the web page.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the Rich Text Editor of Movable Type blogs and websites. The specific method for injecting the script isn't explicitly detailed but would likely involve crafting malicious HTML or JavaScript within the editor's input fields.
*   **Client-Side Execution:** The injected JavaScript executes when a user views the page or entry containing the malicious code. This requires the victim to interact with the compromised content, such as opening a blog post with injected code in the rich text editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Movable Type system. They do not need to be on the same network.
*   **Ability to Inject Script:** The attacker must have the capability to inject JavaScript or HTML into the Rich Text Editor (e.g., by posting a comment, blog post, or other user-generated content), which is then stored and later displayed.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires a victim user to view the content containing the injected script.

**Additional Details**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affected Movable Type versions 5.0x, 5.1x before 5.161, 5.2.x before 5.2.9, and 6.0.x before 6.0.1.
*   **Patches:** The vulnerability was addressed in Movable Type versions 6.0.1, 5.2.9, and 5.161.
*   **Reported by Community:** The vulnerability was reported by a member of the Movable Type community and was kept confidential until the release of the patched versions.
*   **Debian Security Advisory:** The Debian Security Advisory DSA-2841-1 was issued to address this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Versions in Debian:** The Debian packages were updated in the following versions:
    *   squeeze: 4.3.8+dfsg-0+squeeze4
