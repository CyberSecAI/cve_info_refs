- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `checkWeather` function due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing the `forecastrss` XML file from `hxxp://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss`. Specifically, the `temp` attribute within the `<yweather:condition>` tag is vulnerable to overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable device.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs a man-in-the-middle position to intercept and modify the XML response from the weather API.
    - The user must access the `index.asp` page in a web browser to trigger the download of the modified XML file, which then triggers the buffer overflow in `checkWeather` function.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Man-in-the-middle (MitM) position to intercept network traffic between the router and the weather API.
    - Knowledge that the user is accessing the `index.asp` page, which triggers the weather data download.
