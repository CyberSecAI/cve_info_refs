- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). This allows for an elevation of privilege.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to log on to the system locally and then run a specially crafted application designed to elevate privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system.
