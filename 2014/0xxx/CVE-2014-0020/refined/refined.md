    "Root cause": "Improper handling of IRC arguments within the IRC protocol plugin of Pidgin.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The IRC protocol plugin does not properly validate the number of arguments in incoming messages."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious IRC server or a man-in-the-middle attacker can send an IRC message with insufficient arguments, causing a crash and denial of service in the libpurple library used by Pidgin.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious IRC server sending crafted IRC messages",
      "A man-in-the-middle attacker intercepting and modifying IRC messages"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or be able to manipulate messages sent to a Pidgin client using the IRC protocol."
  }
}
