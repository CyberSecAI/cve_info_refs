A malicious server or man-in-the-middle could trigger a crash in libpurple by sending a message with fewer than expected arguments.

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

## Synopsis

Moderate: pidgin security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0139)

## Topic

Updated pidgin packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed
certain HTTP responses. A malicious server could send a specially crafted
HTTP response, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin. (CVE-2013-6485)

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in several protocol
plug-ins in Pidgin (Gadu-Gadu, MXit, SIMPLE). A malicious server could send
a specially crafted message, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin.
(CVE-2013-6487, CVE-2013-6489, CVE-2013-6490)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in several protocol plug-ins in
Pidgin (Yahoo!, XMPP, MSN, stun, IRC). A remote attacker could use these
flaws to crash Pidgin by sending a specially crafted message.
(CVE-2012-6152, CVE-2013-6477, CVE-2013-6481, CVE-2013-6482, CVE-2013-6484,
CVE-2014-0020)

It was found that the Pidgin XMPP protocol plug-in did not verify the
origin of "iq" replies. A remote attacker could use this flaw to spoof an
"iq" reply, which could lead to injection of fake data or cause Pidgin to
crash via a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2013-6483)

A flaw was found in the way Pidgin parsed certain HTTP response headers.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin via a specially
crafted HTTP response header. (CVE-2013-6479)

It was found that Pidgin crashed when a mouse pointer was hovered over a
long URL. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin by sending
a message containing a long URL string. (CVE-2013-6478)

Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Thijs Alkemade, Robert Vehse, Jaime Breva Ribes,
Jacob Appelbaum of the Tor Project, Daniel Atallah, Fabian Yamaguchi and
Christian Wressnegger of the University of Goettingen, Matt Jones of
Volvent, and Yves Younan, Ryan Pentney, and Pawel Janic of Sourcefire VRT
as the original reporters of these issues.

All pidgin users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. Pidgin must be
restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
