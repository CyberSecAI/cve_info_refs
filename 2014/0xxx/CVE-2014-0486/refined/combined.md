## Admin message

GitLab now enforces expiry dates on tokens that originally had no set expiration date. Those tokens were given an expiration date of one year later. Please review your personal access tokens, project access tokens, and group access tokens to ensure you are aware of upcoming expirations. Administrators of GitLab can find more information on how to identify and mitigate interruption in our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#troubleshooting).

# Knot 1.5.2 crashing

Yesterday I updated 2 of our servers to Knot 1.5.2, but on one of them, knotd keeps crashing with an error like:

Sep 9 07:10:17 ns2 kernel: knotd[28174]: segfault at 0 ip 0000000000431b39 sp 00007fd7ddbd85c0 error 4 in knotd[400000+50000]

The last line in the log when this happens is:

2014-09-09T07:29:03 notice: [com.vn] IXFR, incoming, 193.0.0.198@53: fallback to AXFR

I could try and delete the com.vn zone file and the journal files and start again, but before I do that, you may want to discover the bug, if there is one, and fix it.

Please let me know how I can help. Keep in mind that I cannot keep this server offline for too long, so I will either have to fallback to 1.5.1 with the patch for CVE-2014-0486, or find a fix for this.
