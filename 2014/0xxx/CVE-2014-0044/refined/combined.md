Mumble Security Advisory 2014-001
ID: Mumble-SA-2014-001
Date: February 2014
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-0044
Product: Mumble
Mumble Website: http://mumble.info
Permalink: http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-001.txt
Last Updated: 05-02-2014
1. Vulnerability
A malformed Opus voice packet sent to a Mumble client
could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an
out-of-bounds array access, leading to a crash
(Denial of Service).
This can be triggered remotely by an entity
participating in a Mumble voice chat.
2. Affected versions and configurations
Mumble 1.2.4 in its default configuration is vulnerable.
This is the only stable release that is vulnerable.
Pre-release snapshots released prior to 1.2.4 (these
are named 1.2.3--g) that include Opus
support are potentially vulnerable.
Pre-release snapshots released after 1.2.4 (these are
named 1.2.4--g) are vulnerable.
Some distributions (such as Debian and Ubuntu) ship a
pre-release snapshot in their stable distributions.
This snapshot is version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5, and it is
also vulnerable.
3. Mitigation
A Mumble client built without Opus support is not
vulnerable to this issue.
Opus is enabled in the default build configuration for
Mumble, but can be disabled by passing CONFIG+=no-opus
to the qmake program when building the Mumble client.
(Note that Mumble might still enable Opus support if
an installed version of Opus is found via pkg-config.
To avoid this, you will need to pass
CONFIG+="bundled-opus no-opus" to qmake to also disable
the pkg-config querying.)
Version 1.2.3 and prior of Mumble's server component
('Murmur' or 'mumble-server') does not allow the
transmission of Opus packets, and as such a vulnerable
client connected to a stock Murmur server that runs
version 1.2.3 or prior should not be affected by this
issue.
Note however that since Mumble is a centralized VoIP
system, a modified server could potentially also
trigger malformed Opus packets to be sent to clients
of its choosing, thus triggering this issue.
4. Details
Mumble's Opus voice packets are serialized as a buffer
with a length-prefix using Mumble's internal
PacketDataStream serialization format.
Mumble failed to properly validate the length prefix
of received Opus voice packets.
If an Opus packet with a length prefix of zero was
received, the Mumble client would attempt to extract
an Opus buffer of size 0 by calling the dataBlock()
method on a PacketDataStream object. In this case the
dataBlock() method would return a QByteArray that uses
the result of malloc(0) as its internal buffer.
Depending on the system's implementation of malloc this
call may return either NULL, or a non-NULL pointer that
points to a zero-length buffer.
The QByteArray's internal buffer is later used in a
call to the opus\_packet\_get\_samples\_per\_frame() function,
which attempts to read the first byte of the passed-in
buffer to calculate its return value. This can either
cause a NULL pointer dereference, or a read outside the
bounds of the zero-sized heap-allocated buffer.
Similarly, if the Mumble client received an Opus packet
with a length prefix that is negative, or larger than
the encapsulating packet, the dataBlock() method of the
PacketDataStream object would return a QByteArray
constructed by the QByteArray class's default constructor.
That is, a 'null' QByteArray where the internal buffer
is a NULL pointer.
This NULL buffer is then passed to the
opus\_packet\_get\_samples\_per\_frame() function which will
dereference it when attempting to read the first byte of
the buffer.
5. Credits
This issue was discovered by the Mumble team after a
reproducible crash that happened when transmitting
audio was reported by Wesley Wolfe on January 25, 2014.
6. Fix
A fix for this issue has been released in Mumble 1.2.5.
A fix is also available in the master branch of Mumble's
Git repository.
A patch which can be applied to previous vulnerable
versions can be found in-line below.

Package        : mumble
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0044 CVE-2014-0045
Debian Bug     : 737739

Several issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP
client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:

CVE-2014-0044

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an
    out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could
    exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a
    mumble client by causing the application to crash.

CVE-2014-0445

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A
    malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client
    crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute
    arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.
