## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0579)

## Topic

An updated openstack-heat-templates package that fixes three security
issues is now available Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify
and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.
It can also be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn
allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and
applications. Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to
implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

The openstack-heat-templates package provides heat example templates and
image building elements for the openstack-heat package.

It was discovered that certain heat templates used HTTP to insecurely
download packages and signing keys via Yum. An attacker could use this flaw
to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to prevent essential security updates
from being installed on the system. (CVE-2014-0040)

It was found that certain heat templates disabled SSL protection for
various Yum repositories (sslverify=false). An attacker could use this flaw
to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to prevent essential security updates
from being installed on the system. (CVE-2014-0041)

It was discovered that certain heat templates disabled GPG signature
checking of packages via Yum (gpgcheck=0). An attacker could use this flaw
to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to install arbitrary packages on the
system. (CVE-2014-0042)

These issues were discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

All openstack-heat-templates users are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which corrects these issues.

# security issues in heat templates

Bug #1267635 reported by
[Grant Murphy](https://launchpad.net/~gmurphy)
on 2014-01-09

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Heat Templates](https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat-templates) | Confirmed | Undecided | Unassigned |  |
|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Won't Fix | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

I was asked to take a look at the openstack/heat-templates project for security problems. (I think it is being packaged in Fedora).

I went through the code at <https://github.com/openstack/heat-templates>

Here is a summary of the things that I found -

\* yum repositories that make connections via http (should be https)

\* yum repositories being created with sslverify=false (should verify ssl certificates)

\* yum repositories being created with gpgcheck=0 (gpg should be used to verify the packages)

\* importing a rpm key via http

\* using hmac-md5 via dnssec (deprecated?)

\* potentially insecure file permissions for configuration files that contain sensitive info (e.g. passwords)

\* selinux disabled

\* sql database settings containing username / password created in temp file at predictable location with 644 perms. is temp file cleaned up?

\* creating crontab file in /tmp at a predictable location and importing it. (potential toctou issue?)

\* running scripts that are being downloaded via http instead of https.

I've attached a file detailing which problems belong in which files. I'm not entirely sure if this needs to go through the whole CVE process, but I believe that most of these issues need to be addressed.

I think some of this would be relevant for OSSA if we consider(ed) heat-templates in the scope of what we release advisories for.

At this point the scope/coverage for the has be loosely defined. Everyone agrees that Integrated projects count. We have a few extra projects covered too (python-\*client corresponding to integrated projects in particular). We need to have that discussion about scope ASAP to clarify our position. Until we get more resources on the VMT my position is rather minimalist.

So my lazy answer would be to leave them out of scope until the most obvious issues are fixed, at which point we could consider adding them...

\* yum repositories being created with sslverify=false (should verify ssl certificates)

\* yum repositories being created with gpgcheck=0 (gpg should be used to verify the packages)

 \* using hmac-md5 via dnssec (deprecated?)

after a quick search, at least some of the others remain.
