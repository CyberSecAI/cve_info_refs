Topic: Denial of service attack against OpenAFS fileserver processes
CVE-2014-0159
Issued: 14-April-2014
Last Update: 14-April-2014
Affected: OpenAFS file servers
running versions 1.4.8 thru 1.6.6
An attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver can
trigger a buffer overflow, crashing the server.
Clients are not affected.
SUMMARY
=======
The GetStatistics64 remote procedure call (RPC) was introduced in
OpenAFS 1.4.8 as part of the support for fileserver partitions larger
than 2 TiB. The GetStatistics64 RPC is used by remote administrative
programs to retrieve statistical information about fileservers. The
GetStatistics64 RPC requests do not require authentication.
A bug has been discovered in the GetStatistics64 RPC which can trigger a
fileserver crash. The version argument of the GetStatistics64 RPC is
used to determine how much memory is allocated for the RPC reply.
However the range of this argument is not validated, allowing an
attacker to cause insufficient memory to be allocated for the
statistical information reply buffer.
IMPACT
======
By sending an unauthenticated request for fileserver statistical
information, it is possible to crash a file server running the
affected code.
No publicly available exploits are currently known.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS 1.4.8 to (and including) 1.6.6
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS version
1.6.7 or newer.
For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available directly from:
http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2014-001.patch
Note that this patch is against 1.6.6. For the 1.4 series, use the following
patch:
http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2014-001-1.4.patch
The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available from
http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html

Package        : openafs
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0159

Michael Meffie discovered that in OpenAFS, a distributed filesystem,
an attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver can
trigger a buffer overflow, crashing the fileserver, and potentially
permitting the execution of arbitrary code.

In addition, this update addresses a minor denial of service issue:
the listerer thread of the server will hang for about one second when
receiving an invalid packet, giving the opportunity to slow down
the server to an unusable state by sending such packets.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
