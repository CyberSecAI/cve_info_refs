{
  "CVE-2014-0159": {
    "Description": "The GetStatistics64 remote procedure call (RPC) in OpenAFS versions 1.4.8 through 1.6.6 does not validate the version argument, which allows an attacker to cause insufficient memory allocation for the RPC reply buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow and a server crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GetStatistics64 RPC does not validate the version argument, leading to insufficient memory allocation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, causing a file server crash, potentially leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS file server can send a specially crafted GetStatistics64 RPC request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the OpenAFS file server, and no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
