| [Description](#c0)  Abraham Marin Perez    2004-05-17 08:59:38 UTC  ``` Hello. I have modified the ebuilds for kdevelop 3.0.1, 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 in order to create entries in Gnome main menu. The added lines are basicly the same in all three files, but I think it will be easier in this way for the person in charge.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.     I do not know how important the enhancement bugs are but I think that desktop integration is important for both creating a good work environment and attracting new users to Linux. I sent another ebuilds for desktop integration some months ago and they have not been used, they do not seem to be rejected, just ignored. These bugs are #37384 and #38502, and I hope this one will not join the "black list" too.  If the problem is that there are more important bugs to work with (and I am sure there are) new administrators may be assigned for this not-so-important tasks (I think I could do it...).  Thanks. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Abraham Marin Perez    2004-05-17 09:01:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 31584](attachment.cgi?id=31584 "New version for ebuild 3.0.1") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=31584&action=edit "New version for ebuild 3.0.1")] New version for ebuild 3.0.1 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Abraham Marin Perez    2004-05-17 09:03:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 31585](attachment.cgi?id=31585 "New version for ebuild 3.0.2") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=31585&action=edit "New version for ebuild 3.0.2")] New version for ebuild 3.0.2 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Abraham Marin Perez    2004-05-17 09:03:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 31586](attachment.cgi?id=31586 "New version for ebuild 3.0.3") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=31586&action=edit "New version for ebuild 3.0.3")] New version for ebuild 3.0.3 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dominik Stadler (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-02-03 10:35:24 UTC  ``` does this still apply for the current version 3.1.2? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Abraham Marin Perez    2005-02-08 12:27:50 UTC  ``` That's what I think, but I'll check it out anyway. If it doesn't I'll try to change it in order to work. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Abraham Marin Perez    2005-02-08 16:10:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 50791](attachment.cgi?id=50791 "New ebuild with gnome integration") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=50791&action=edit "New ebuild with gnome integration")] New ebuild with gnome integration  The new script ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Abraham Marin Perez    2005-02-08 16:11:49 UTC  ``` I've been checking it and, after changing some stuff, I think it works now, at least it does for me. I hope this helps. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-07-01 09:04:27 UTC  ``` AFAICS kdevelop 3.2.1 installs .desktop files which work just fine with  gnome 2.10's menu.  ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0745)

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-16,
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2014-0534, CVE-2014-0535, CVE-2014-0536)

Multiple flaws in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a
specially crafted web page. (CVE-2014-0531, CVE-2014-0532, CVE-2014-0533)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.378.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
