Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a change in the implementation of the `{{link-to}}` helper in Ember.js, where user-supplied data bound to the `title` attribute was not being properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. The `{{link-to}}` helper, when used in a non-block form, failed to escape user-supplied data bound to its `title` attribute. This allowed for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application by crafting a malicious payload within the user-supplied data.
- **Context of Current Domain:** The injected JavaScript would execute within the context of the current domain, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Supplied Data:** The vulnerability is triggered when user-supplied data is bound to the `title` attribute of the `{{link-to}}` helper.
- **Non-Block Form of `{{link-to}}` Helper:** The vulnerability is specific to the non-block form of the `{{link-to}}` helper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Influence User-Supplied Data:** Attackers need to be able to influence the data that is being bound to the `title` attribute of the `{{link-to}}` helper. This could be through various means, such as URL parameters, form input fields, or other methods.
- **Usage of Affected Ember.js versions:** The attack is applicable on Ember.js versions 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0, and 1.3.1.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved ensuring that the `title` attribute is properly escaped using `Ember.Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression` before being rendered.
- The vulnerability was reported by Hyder Ali of Zoho.
- Patches were released in Ember.js versions 1.2.2 and 1.3.2.
- Workarounds included manually escaping the user-supplied values bound to the `title` attribute before using them in `{{link-to}}` helpers.
