Subject: [CVE-2014-0046] XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in
 Non-block Form

XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in Non-block Form

There is a vulnerability in the {{link-to}} helper in Ember.js. This
vulnerability
has been assigned CVE-2014-0046.

Versions Affected: 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0, 1.3.1
Not affected: Versions prior to 1.2
Fixed Versions: 1.2.2, 1.3.2

Impact
-------

In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.  However, a change
made
to the implementation of the {{link-to}} helper means that any user-supplied
data bound to the {{link-to}} helper's title attribute will not be escaped
correctly.

In applications that use the {{link-to}} helper in non-block form and bind
the title attribute to user-supplied content, a specially-crafted payload
could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain
("XSS").

All users running an affected release and binding user-supplied data to the
{{link-to}} helper's title attribute should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

Releases
--------

Releases are available on emberjs.com/builds/#/tagged

Workarounds
-----------

Ensure that you escape any user-supplied value that you bind to the
{{link-to}}
helper's title attribute. For example, if you bind a value named userTitle:

 {{link-to "user" title=userTitle}}

Ensure that you escape the value of userTitle using
Ember.Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression:

 var userTitle = this.get('userTitle');
 var safeUserTitle = Ember.Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression(userTitle);
 this.set('userTitle', safeUserTitle);

Patches
-------

Patches are available as an attachment to the announcement on the
emberjs-security list:

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ember-security/1h6FRgr8lXQ>

Credits
-------

This vulnerability was reported to us by Hyder Ali of Zoho. Many thanks for
working with us on the patches and advisory.

# Security Releases - Ember 1.2.2, and 1.3.2

Feb 7, 2014 –
By
[Robert Jackson](/author/robert-jackson)

Because developers trust Ember.js to handle sensitive customer data in
production, we take the security of the project extremely seriously. In
fact, we're one of the few JavaScript projects that has a [clearly
outlined security policy](/security/) and a
[low-traffic mailing list exclusively for security
announcements](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ember-security).

Today we are announcing the release of Ember.js 1.2.2,
1.3.2, and 1.4.0-beta.6 that contain an important security fix:

* 1.4.0-beta.6 -- [Compare View](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/compare/v1.4.0-beta.5%E2%80%A6v1.4.0-beta.6)
* 1.3.2 -- [Compare View](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/compare/v1.3.1%E2%80%A6v1.3.2)
* 1.2.2 -- [Compare View](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/compare/v1.2.1%E2%80%A6v1.2.2)

These releases contain the fix for an XSS vulnerability that
you can learn more about on our security mailing list:

* [CVE-2014-0046](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ember-security/1h6FRgr8lXQ)

It is recommended that you update immediately. In order to ease
upgrading, the only major change in each release is the security fix
(other than 1.4.0-beta.6, which is a normal beta channel release with
the fix rolled in).

We would like to thank Hyder Ali of [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com)
for responsibly disclosing and working with us on the patch
and the advisory.

If you discover what you believe may be a security issue in Ember.js, we
ask that you follow our [responsible disclosure
policy](/security/).

If you are using Ember.js in production, please consider subscribing to
our [security announcements mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ember-security). It is
extremely low-traffic and only contains announcements such as these.
