# RHSA-2014:0789 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: python27-mod\_wsgi and python33-mod\_wsgi security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0789)

## Topic

Updated python27-mod\_wsgi and python33-mod\_wsgi packages that fix one
security issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The mod\_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant
interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.

It was found that mod\_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to
setuid() failed. If mod\_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run
WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could
possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-0240)

Note: mod\_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI
applications. Systems relying on mod\_wsgi to limit or sandbox the
privileges of mod\_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution
with proper privilege separation.

Red Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Róbert Kisteleki as the original reporter of this
issue.

All python27-mod\_wsgi and python33-mod\_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to
these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this
issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1101863#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-28 05:44:53 UTC  ``` mod_wsgi allows you to host Python applications on the Apache HTTP Server. It was reported that mod_wsgi could fail to drop root privileges: if the setuid() call failed, an error was logged and mod_wsgi continued running with elevated privileges, rather than exiting.  If an administrator has configured mod_wsgi to allow less trusted users to run a WSGI application, they could use this flaw to escalate their privileges if they are able to cause the setuid() call to fail.  Note that it is not clear whether mod_wsgi was designed to be safe against local attackers, and this may be a similar situation to PHP's safe mode, [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=169857#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=169857#c1 "CLOSED WONTFIX - php open_basedir / safe mode bypass")  This issue has been fixed in mod_wsgi version 3.5.

Note: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI applications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the privileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution with proper privilege separation.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1101863#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-25 08:59:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:1091 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1091.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: Security release for mod_wsgi (version 3.5)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So CVEs were assigned, this is now public, very well written an
detailed write up is at:

<http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2014/05/security-release-for-modwsgi-version-35.html>

The Apache/mod_wsgi module I authored has been in suspended animation
for some time. Today though I announce a new release (version 3.5) to
address a security vulnerability, plus bring overdue updates to
address issues in support for Apache 2.4 and Python 3.4.

Version 3.5 of mod_wsgi can be downloaded from github at:

<https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/releases>
The release notes for version 3.5 of mod_wsgi can be found at:
<http://modwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release-notes/version-3.5.html>
Although the security vulnerability will not affect all users, it is
highly recommended you upgrade to this new version, or any newer
revision of a Linux distributions binary package which includes a back
ported fix for the issue.
In addition to the details of this vulnerability, I also include here
details of an issue which was previously fixed in mod_wsgi 3.4 but was
recently also discovered to be more severe than previously believed
and which itself constitutes a security issue.

For more details read on. I will follow up this post with a further
post about the general future of the mod_wsgi module for Apache.

Issue: Possibility of local privilege escalation when using daemon
mode. (CVE-2014-0240)

The issue is believed to affect Linux systems running kernel versions
> = 2.6.0 and < 3.1.0.

The issue affects all versions of mod_wsgi up to and including version
3.4.

The source of the issue derives from mod_wsgi not correctly handling
Linux specific error codes from setuid(), which differ to what would
be expected to be returned by UNIX systems conforming to the Open
Group UNIX specification for setuid().

<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html>
<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/setuid.html>
This difference in behaviour between Linux and the UNIX specification
was believed to have been removed in version 3.1.0 of the Linux kernel.

<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/linux.kernel/u6cKf4D1D-k>
The issue would allow a user, where Apache is initially being started
as the root user and where running code under mod_wsgi daemon mode as
an unprivileged user, to manipulate the number of processes run by
that user to affect the outcome of setuid() when daemon mode processes
are forked and so gain escalated privileges for the users code.

Due to the nature of the issue, if you provide a service or allow
untrusted users to run Python web applications you do not control the
code for, and do so using daemon mode of mod_wsgi, you should update
mod_wsgi as soon as possible.

If you are unable to upgrade to a newer version of mod_wsgi, but wish
to back port the fix to an older version of mod_wsgi that you are
using, then the patch from mod_wsgi 3.5 can be found at:

<https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/commit/d9d5fea585b23991f76532a9b07de7fcd3b649f4>
There is no workaround for this issue, so using a version of mod_wsgi
which incorporates the fix is your only choice.

Thanks go to Róbert Kisteleki for identifying this issue.
Issue: Possibility of information disclosure via Content-Type response
header. (CVE-2014-0242)

The issue was actually identified and previously fixed in version 3.4
(August 2012) of mod_wsgi.

Response Content-Type header could be corrupted when being sent in
multithreaded configuration and embedded mode being used. Problem thus
affected Windows and worker MPM on UNIX.

Release notes for version 3.4 of mod_wsgi can be viewed at:

<http://modwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release-notes/version-3.4.html>
At the time it was believed to be relatively benign, only ever having
been seen with one specific web application (Trac -
<http://trac.edgewall.org>), with the corrupted value always appearing
to be replaced with a small set of known values which themselves did
not raise concerns.

A new example of this problem has now been identified which opens this
issue up as being able to cause arbitrary corruption of the web server
HTTP response Content-Type value, resulting in possible exposure of
data from the hosted web application to a HTTP client.

The new example also opens the possibility that the issue can occur
with any Apache MPM and not just multithreaded MPMs as previously
identified. Albeit that it still requires some form of background
application threads to be in use, when a single threaded Apache MPM is
being used.

In either case, it is still however restricted to the case where
embedded mode of mod_wsgi is being used.

The specific scenario which can trigger the issue is where the value
for the Content-Type response header is dynamically generated, and
where the stack frame where the calculation was done went out of use
between the time that the WSGI start_response() function was called
and the first non empty byte string was yielded from the WSGI
application for the response, resulting in the Python object being
destroyed and memory returned to the free list.

At the same time, it would have been necessary for a parallel request
thread or an application background thread to execute during that
window of time and perform sufficient object allocations so as to
reuse the memory previously used by the value of the Content-Type
response header.

Example code which can be used to trigger the specific scenario can be
found at:

<https://gist.github.com/GrahamDumpleton/14b31ebe18166a89b090>
That example code also provides a workaround if you find yourself
affected by the issue but cannot upgrade straight away. It consists of
the @intern_content_type decorator/wrapper. This can be applied to the
WSGI application entry point and will use a cache to store the value
of the Content-Type response header to ensure it is persistent for the
life of the request.

If you are still using a version of mod_wsgi older than version 3.4,
but are unable to upgrade to a newer version of mod_wsgi  and wish to
back port the fix to the older version of mod_wsgi that you are using,
then the patch from mod_wsgi 3.4 can be found at:

<https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/commit/b0a149c1f5e569932325972e2e20176a42e43517>
Thanks go to Buck Golemon for identifying this subsequent issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Version 3.5[¶](#version-3-5 "Link to this heading")

Version 3.5 of mod\_wsgi can be obtained from:

> <https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/archive/3.5.tar.gz>

## Security Issues[¶](#security-issues "Link to this heading")

1. Local privilege escalation when using daemon mode. (CVE-2014-0240)

The issue is believed to affect Linux systems running kernel versions >=
2.6.0 and < 3.1.0.

The issue affects all versions of mod\_wsgi up to and including version 3.4.

The source of the issue derives from mod\_wsgi not correctly handling Linux
specific error codes from setuid(), which differ to what would be expected
to be returned by UNIX systems conforming to the Open Group UNIX
specification for setuid().

> * <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html>
> * <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/setuid.html>

This difference in behaviour between Linux and the UNIX specification was
believed to have been removed in version 3.1.0 of the Linux kernel.

> * <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/linux.kernel/u6cKf4D1D-k>

The issue would allow a user, where Apache is initially being started as
the root user and where running code under mod\_wsgi daemon mode as an
unprivileged user, to manipulate the number of processes run by that user
to affect the outcome of setuid() when daemon mode processes are forked and
so gain escalated privileges for the users code.

Due to the nature of the issue, if you provide a service or allow untrusted
users to run Python web applications you do not control the code for, and
do so using daemon mode of mod\_wsgi, you should update mod\_wsgi as soon as
possible.

## Bugs Fixed[¶](#bugs-fixed "Link to this heading")

1. Python 3 installations can add a suffix to the Python library. So instead
of `libpythonX.Y.so` it can be `libpythonX.Ym.so`.

2. When using daemon mode, if an uncaught exception occurred when handling
a request, when response was proxied back via the Apache child process, an
internal value for the HTTP status line was not cleared correctly. This
was resulting in a HTTP status in response to client of ‘200 Error’ rather
than ‘500 Internal Server Error’.

Note that this only affected the status line and not the actual HTTP
status. The status would still be 500 and the client would still interpret
it as a failed request.

3. Null out Apache scoreboard handle in daemon processes for Apache 2.4 to
avoid process crash when lingering close cleanup occurs.

4. Workaround broken MacOS X XCode Toolchain references in Apache apxs
build configuration tool and operating system libtool script. This means
it is no longer necessary to manually go into:

```
Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains

```

and manually add symlinks to define the true location of the compiler tools.

5. Restore ability to compile mod\_wsgi source code under Apache 1.3.

6. Fix checks for whether the ITK MPM is used and whether ITK MPM specific
actions should be taken around the ownership of the mod\_wsgi daemon process
listener socket.

7. Fix issue where when using Python 3.4, mod\_wsgi daemon processes would
actually crash when the processes were being shutdown.

8. Made traditional library linking the default on MacOS X. If needing
framework style linking for the Python framework, then use the
`--enable-framework` option. The existing `--disable-framework` has now
been removed given that the default action has been swapped around.

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

1. For Linux 2.4 and later, enable ability of daemon processes to dump core
files when Apache `CoreDumpDirectory` directive used.

2. Attempt to log whether daemon process exited normally or was killed off
by an unexpected signal.
