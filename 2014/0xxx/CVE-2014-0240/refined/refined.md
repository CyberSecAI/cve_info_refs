{
  "CVE-2014-0240": {
    "Description": "The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache. It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to setuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.",
    "Root cause": "mod_wsgi did not correctly handle Linux-specific error codes from setuid(), differing from the Open Group UNIX specification. If setuid() failed, mod_wsgi would not exit, and continue running with elevated privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege dropping on setuid() failure."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user able to run a WSGI application could potentially exploit this flaw.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to run a WSGI application configured in mod_wsgi. The attacker also needs to be able to manipulate the number of processes run by that user to affect the outcome of setuid() when daemon mode processes are forked."
