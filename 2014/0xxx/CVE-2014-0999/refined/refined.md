Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Sendio ESP web interface includes the session cookie (`jsessionid`) value directly in the URL when retrieving email content. This exposes the session identifier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `jsessionid` cookie, used for authentication, is exposed within the URL. This violates secure session management practices.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Exposing the session ID allows an attacker to potentially take over a user's active session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Bypass:** An attacker can bypass authentication by hijacking a valid user's session.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** After session hijacking, the attacker can gain access to the victim's email messages and perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email with Malicious Links/Embedded Content:** An attacker can send an email with a link or embedded image tag that points to a controlled web site. When the victim clicks the link or the image loads, the browser sends a request including the vulnerable URL in the referrer header. The attacker can then harvest the session ID from the referrer header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails to a target user of the Sendio ESP system.
*   **Control Over a Web Server:** The attacker needs control over a web server to receive and analyze the "Referrer" header that reveals the session ID.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know the specific format of the URL, where the session ID is included in the path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is only present on HTTP web sessions and not on HTTPS.
*   The advisory mentions a fix in Sendio software Version 7.2.4.
*   The vendor recommends disabling HTTP and only using HTTPS as a workaround for systems that have not been upgraded to version 7.2.4.
