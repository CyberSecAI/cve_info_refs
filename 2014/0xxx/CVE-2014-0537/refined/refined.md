RELATED:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple flaws in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content and a flaw that would lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Security bypass vulnerabilities due to how flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content, and a flaw that leads to CSRF attacks via vulnerable JSONP callback APIs.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could create a specially crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or execute arbitrary code. The CSRF flaw could lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
  - Attack vectors: Exploiting vulnerabilities in SWF content handling and JSONP callback APIs.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malicious SWF file and find a way to get a victim to load a page containing this malicious content, or exploit the vulnerable JSONP APIs to conduct CSRF attacks.
