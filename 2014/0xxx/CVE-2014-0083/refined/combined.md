### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065086#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-13 21:42:46 UTC  ``` Pierre Carrier of airbnb reports:  The net-ldap gem generates SSHA passwords with a salt value between "0" and "999", providing slightly less than 10 bits of entropy.  External reference: <https://github.com/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap/blob/master/lib/net/ldap/password.rb>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1065086#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-13 21:44:33 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Pierre Carrier of airbnb for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1065086#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-13 21:45:50 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.
