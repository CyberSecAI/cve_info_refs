- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Festo CECX-X-M1 controller has two unauthenticated ports (4000/TCP and 4001/TCP) for debug and log services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication and access control. Unauthenticated access to debug and log services allows modification of memory and logging.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could modify configuration settings, remove log records, and hide malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the vulnerable ports (4000/TCP and 4001/TCP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the device. Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.
