Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0496)

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-14,
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2014-0510, CVE-2014-0517, CVE-2014-0518, CVE-2014-0519,
CVE-2014-0520)

A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to bypass the same-origin
policy. (CVE-2014-0516)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.359.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](#c0)  Tomasz Orzechowski    2004-05-14 04:28:47 UTC  ``` The ppp-2.4.2-r2 package contains an old version of mppe/mppc patches obtained from <http://www.polbox.com/h/hs001/>  The current version is 1.0 and the ebuild contains 0.82  The ebuild should be upgraded to the current patches before it leaves ~x86  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michal Suchanek    2004-08-02 03:39:53 UTC  ``` btw mppc is patented see ppp readme ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Lars Geiger    2004-08-16 16:12:51 UTC  ``` On 2004-08-15, this patch has reached version 1.1. It's located at <http://www.polbox.com/h/hs001/ppp-2.4.2-stdopt-mppe-mppc-1.1.patch.gz>  Although I'm not really sure if Gentoo should use this patch for ppp by default at all. Most people won't need it, so why risk any legal trouble if it's not used by the majority anyway? And those who actually need it can easily put an ebuild into the overlay and add that patch there. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  José Mata Fernandes    2004-09-16 03:44:00 UTC  ``` The patch in the ebuild is obsolete, so, i suspect no one will use that by default. Whoever wants to add mppe/mppc support in ppp, will download and patch the most recent patch found in the site.  What i think should be made: 1- Update the patch version on ppp (there is allready the legal essue, why have the an obsolete version?)      OR  2- Add a USE flag for mppe. Since there is the module in kernel too, add the USE flag support in portage to: ppp, gentoo-sources and gentoo-dev-sources. I will try to make a ebuild patch for ppp (it will be my first one...). ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  José Mata Fernandes    2004-09-16 07:25:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 39699](attachment.cgi?id=39699 "enable mppe-mppc support to ppp with a USE option") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=39699&action=edit "enable mppe-mppc support to ppp with a USE option"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=39699&action=diff "enable mppe-mppc support to ppp with a USE option")] enable mppe-mppc support to ppp with a USE option  I think this should go into portage. About the patent issue present here, its a user decision to USE="mppe-mppc", maybe someone can add a notice when the build finish, just to make sure the user knows what he/she is doing.  patch instructions:  cp ppp-2.4.2-r2-mppe-mppc.patch /usr/portage/net-dialup/ppp cd /usr/portage/net-dialup/ppp patch -p1 < ppp-2.4.2-r2-mppe-mppc.patch  download ppp-2.4.2-mppe-mppc-1.1.patch.gz from <http://www.polbox.com/h/hs001/> cp ppp-2.4.2-mppe-mppc-1.1.patch.gz /usr/portage/net-dialup/ppp/files/2.4.2  USE="mppe-mppc" emerge ppp  -------------  Offcorse, anytime one emerge sync, the process must be repeated. This can be fixed making a custom ebuild for ppp and place it in /usr/local/portage.  Hope this helps (it is helping some gentoo friends here in Portugal) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Bjarke Istrup Pedersen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-26 11:48:14 UTC  ``` I vote for this one too, it's very usefull, I like the idea of the use flag, since people worried about the patent can disable it. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-27 04:00:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 47991](show_bug.cgi?id=47991 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - ppp-2.4.2-r1 is missing the patch solving wrong stateful/stateless MPPE mode negotiation") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-27 04:09:59 UTC  ``` added. ``` |  |
