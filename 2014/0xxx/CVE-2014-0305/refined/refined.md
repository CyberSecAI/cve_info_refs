Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: Specifically, this CVE is categorized as an "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
- The vulnerability is present in how Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory, leading to the possibility of memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can gain the same user rights as the user running the vulnerable instance of Internet Explorer. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website through means like phishing emails, instant messages with links or through compromised websites or user-provided content.
- Exploitation via compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious code into websites, including those that accept user-generated content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise an existing website and needs to persuade the victim to visit that page in their vulnerable web browser.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the victim's system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for affected Windows clients and "Moderate" for affected Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, preventing the potential memory corruption.
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of memory corruption issues addressed in the same security update (MS14-012), which includes several other CVEs such as CVE-2014-0297, CVE-2014-0298, etc.
- Microsoft is not aware of active exploitation attempts of this specific CVE when the security bulletin was initially released, but there are reports of limited, targeted attacks exploiting other memory corruption vulnerabilities fixed by the same update.
- This vulnerability impacts various versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) running on different versions of Windows.
