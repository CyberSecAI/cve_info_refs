Package        : samba
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0178 CVE-2014-0244 CVE-2014-3493
Debian Bug     :

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in Samba, a SMB/CIFS
file, print, and login server:

CVE-2014-0178

    Information leak vulnerability in the VFS code, allowing an
    authenticated user to retrieve eight bytes of uninitialized memory
    when shadow copy is enabled.

CVE-2014-0244

    Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in the nmbd Netbios name
    service daemon. A malformed packet can cause the nmbd server to
    enter an infinite loop, preventing it to process later requests to
    the Netbios name service.

CVE-2014-3493

    Denial of service (daemon crash) in the smbd file server daemon. An
    authenticated user attempting to read a Unicode path using a
    non-Unicode request can force the daemon to overwrite memory at an
    invalid address.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u4.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Updated samba packages fix multiple vulnerabilities

Publication date: 04 Jul 2014

Modification date: 04 Jul 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-0178](CVE-2014-0178.html)
,
[CVE-2014-0244](CVE-2014-0244.html)
,
[CVE-2014-3493](CVE-2014-3493.html)

## Description

```
Updated samba packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Information leak vulnerability in the VFS code, allowing an authenticated
user to retrieve eight bytes of uninitialized memory when shadow copy is
enabled (CVE-2014-0178).

Samba versions before 3.6.24, 4.0.19, and 4.1.9 are vulnerable to a denial
of service on the nmbd NetBIOS name services daemon. A malformed packet
can cause the nmbd server to loop the CPU and prevent any further NetBIOS
name service (CVE-2014-0244).

Samba versions before 3.6.24, 4.0.19, and 4.1.9 are affected by a denial
of service crash involving overwriting memory on an authenticated
connection to the smbd file server (CVE-2014-3493).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Samba versions before 3.6.24, 4.0.19, and 4.1.9 are affected by a denial of service crash involving overwriting memory on an authenticated connection to the smbd file server (CVE-2014-3493).
