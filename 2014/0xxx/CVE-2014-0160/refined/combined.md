##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The client-server HMI (human machine interface) system SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part
of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in applications requiring a high degree of customer-
speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements
or functions.

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks.
It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support
of other protocols with data encryption such as FTPs. The communication processor protects S7-1500
stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conﬁdentiality of transmitted data.

RUGGEDCOM APE serves as an utility-grade computing platform for the RUGGEDCOM RX1500 router
family.
It also allows to run third party software applications without needing to procure an external
industrial PC.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-0160

The affected products could allow attackers to read sensitive data (this includes private keys and user
credentials) from the process memory if the attackers have network access to the affected devices.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

This flaw could be used to reveal up to 64k of memory from a connected client or server.  Only 1.0.1 releases of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1f (and 1.0.2 betas)  The following upstream commit introduced TLS/DTLS heatbeat support and also this issue:  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=4817504>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c1)  Huzaifa S.

These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as my install media?  I understand that the OpenSSL that was on the install media for 6.4 is NOT vulnerable and that the OpenSSL that is on the install media for 6.5 IS vulnerable.  But, once a 6.4 is patched does it not get ALL of the RHEL 6 updates?  According to the link provided:  "Updated openssl packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6."  and the packages listed (I'm only including the SRPM for brevity):  "openssl-1.0.1e-15.el6.src.rpm File outdated by:  RHSA-2014:0376"   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c44)  Shabba    2014-04-10 14:23:03 UTC  ``` If you installed 6.4 and then ran updates to update it to 6.5, then you were running 6.5, and OpenSSL 1.0.1, from that point forward.

I just want it to be made clear whether or not installing RHEL 6 via RHEL 6.4 install media and then doing the typical "yum update" leaves you in an invulnerable state.  I am also not trying to verify that MY systems are vulnerable as I do not administer any RHEL systems at this time.  I am trying to verfy that when someone else tells me they are not vulnerable because they installed RHEL 6.4 that I can trust that statement.  The problem is increased if the openssl package is not updated because the normal vefification of a CVE patch (rpm -qa --changelog | grep CVE-YYYY-NNNN) would show them as vulnerable (since it would return nothing) as opposed to patched.   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c46)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-10 15:03:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Forrest Tiffany from [comment #43](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c43)) > These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get > installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as > my install media?  If you installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 from 6.4 media and installed all updates since then, you already installed all updates that were released as part of 6.5 minor release.  If you install openssl update RHBA-2013:1585 (or any subsequent openssl update), you updated to affected version regardless of what media you originally installed from.  Use 'rpm -q openssl' to see what version you currently have installed.  The confusion may be related to the fact that there is a support / update stream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 that does not include 6.5 updates.  That has openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2 as the latest released version.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

This flaw could be used to reveal up to 64k of memory from a connected client or server.  Only 1.0.1 releases of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1f (and 1.0.2 betas)  The following upstream commit introduced TLS/DTLS heatbeat support and also this issue:  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=4817504>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c1)  Huzaifa S.

These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as my install media?  I understand that the OpenSSL that was on the install media for 6.4 is NOT vulnerable and that the OpenSSL that is on the install media for 6.5 IS vulnerable.  But, once a 6.4 is patched does it not get ALL of the RHEL 6 updates?  According to the link provided:  "Updated openssl packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6."  and the packages listed (I'm only including the SRPM for brevity):  "openssl-1.0.1e-15.el6.src.rpm File outdated by:  RHSA-2014:0376"   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c44)  Shabba    2014-04-10 14:23:03 UTC  ``` If you installed 6.4 and then ran updates to update it to 6.5, then you were running 6.5, and OpenSSL 1.0.1, from that point forward.

I just want it to be made clear whether or not installing RHEL 6 via RHEL 6.4 install media and then doing the typical "yum update" leaves you in an invulnerable state.  I am also not trying to verify that MY systems are vulnerable as I do not administer any RHEL systems at this time.  I am trying to verfy that when someone else tells me they are not vulnerable because they installed RHEL 6.4 that I can trust that statement.  The problem is increased if the openssl package is not updated because the normal vefification of a CVE patch (rpm -qa --changelog | grep CVE-YYYY-NNNN) would show them as vulnerable (since it would return nothing) as opposed to patched.   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c46)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-10 15:03:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Forrest Tiffany from [comment #43](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c43)) > These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get > installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as > my install media?  If you installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 from 6.4 media and installed all updates since then, you already installed all updates that were released as part of 6.5 minor release.  If you install openssl update RHBA-2013:1585 (or any subsequent openssl update), you updated to affected version regardless of what media you originally installed from.  Use 'rpm -q openssl' to see what version you currently have installed.  The confusion may be related to the fact that there is a support / update stream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 that does not include 6.5 updates.  That has openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2 as the latest released version.

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0376)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0377)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Storage 2.1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

All users of Red Hat Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the
update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as
httpd and other SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system
rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# RHSA-2014:0378 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0378)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue is now
available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects this issue.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To upgrade Hypervisors in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environments
using the disk image provided by this package, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Hypervisor_Deployment_Guide/chap-Deployment_Guide-Upgrading_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_Hypervisors.html>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Re: heartbleed OpenSSL bug CVE-2014-0160

*From*: Fabien Bourdaire <lists () ecsc co uk>

*Date*: Wed, 09 Apr 2014 11:39:27 +0100

```
We've created some iptables rules to block all heartbeat queries using
the very powerful u32 module.

The rules allow you to mitigate systems that can't yet be patched by
blocking ALL the heartbeat handshakes. We also like the capability to
log external scanners ;)

The rules have been specifically created for HTTPS traffic and may be
adapted for other protocols; SMTPS/IMAPS/...

# Log rules
iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp --dport 443  -m u32 --u32 \
"52=0x18030000:0x1803FFFF" -j LOG --log-prefix "BLOCKED: HEARTBEAT"

# Block rules
iptables -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp --dport 443  -m u32 --u32 \
"52=0x18030000:0x1803FFFF" -j DROP

# Wireshark rules
$ tshark  -i interface port 443 -R 'frame[68:1] == 18'
$ tshark  -i interface port 443 -R 'ssl.record.content_type == 24'

We believe that this should only be used as a temporary fix to decrease
the exposure window. The log rule should allow you to test the firewall
rules before being used in production. It goes without saying that if
you have any suggested improvements to these rules we would be grateful
if you could share them with the security community.

Clearly, use of these rules is at your own risk :)

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)
 [Installing on Linux or UNIX systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_unix_itcam.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.4.0.0. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.40.00.13'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Troubleshooting installation problems from the Support site

For more detailed information, refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_install_chapter.html>

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

For detailed instructions, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_uninstall_chapter.html>

## Details

Neel Mehta discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TLS

heartbeat extension. An attacker could use this issue to obtain up to 64k

of memory contents from the client or server, possibly leading to the

disclosure of private keys and other sensitive information. ([CVE-2014-0160](/security/CVE-2014-0160))

Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled

timing during swap operations in the Montgomery ladder implementation. An

attacker could use this issue to perform side-channel attacks and possibly

recover ECDSA nonces. ([CVE-2014-0076](/security/CVE-2014-0076))

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [1.0.1e-3ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/1.0.1e-3ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.7)

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 5.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.0 |

# OpenSSL ‘heartbleed’ bug live blog

[Fox IT](https://blog.fox-it.com/author/marketingfoxit/ "Posts by Fox IT")
[Blog](https://blog.fox-it.com/category/blog/), [News from the FoxLab](https://blog.fox-it.com/category/news-from-the-foxlab/)

![heartbleed](https://i0.wp.com/blog.fox-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/heartbleed.png?resize=123%2C150)A bug has been identified in [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/), all details can be found at [heartbleed.com](http://heartbleed.com/). The bug has been assigned CVE-2014-0160. OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 – 1.0.1f are vulnerable. We advise to upgrade OpenSSL to version 1.0.1g or higher

## Test if you are vulnerable

You can test if you are vulnerable by requesting a heartbeat response with a large response. If the server replies your SSL service is probably vulnerable. You can use any of the tests below:

* <http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/> : a web based test
* <http://s3.jspenguin.org/ssltest.py> : a python script to test for the vulnerability from the command line. If you want to scan multiple sites you can use a [modified version](http://blog.fox-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fox_heartbleedtest.zip) with easily parseable output.
* If you use Chrome you can install the [Chromebleed checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebleed/eeoekjnjgppnaegdjbcafdggilajhpic) that alerts you when visiting a vulnerable site.

This vulnerability only applies to OpenSSL versions 1.0.1-1.0.1f. Other SSL libraries, such as [PolarSSL](https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/security-advisories/polarssl-security-advisory-2014-01), are not vulnerable. [OpenVPN-NL](https://openvpn.fox-it.com/), which is depending on PolarSSL, is not affected.

## Advice

We advise to perform the following steps for every vulnerable SSL service

* Upgrade the OpenSSL version to 1.0.1g
* Request revocation of the current SSL certificate
* Regenerate your private key
* Request and replace the SSL certificate

## Indicator of Compromise

It is possible to detect successful exploitation of this vulnerability by inspecting the network traffic. We have developed 2 sets of Snort signatures to detect succesful exploitation of the ‘heartbleed bug’. The first set has a higher detection rate but also quite a few false positives:

```
alert tcp any [!80,​!445] -> any [!80,​!445] (msg:"FOX-SRT - Suspicious - Possible SSLv3 Large Heartbeat Response"; flow:established; ssl_version:sslv3; content:"|18 03 00|"; depth:3; byte_test:2,​>,​200,​3; byte_test:2,​<,​17000,​3; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 600; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001126; rev:8;)
```
```
alert tcp any [!80,​!445] -> any [!80,​!445] (msg:"FOX-SRT - Suspicious - Possible TLSv1 Large Heartbeat Response"; flow:established; ssl_version:tls1.0; content:"|18 03 01|"; depth:3; byte_test:2,​>,​200,​3; byte_test:2,​<,​17000,​3; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 600; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001127; rev:8;)
```
```
alert tcp any [!80,​!445] -> any [!80,​!445] (msg:"FOX-SRT - Suspicious - Possible TLSv1.1 Large Heartbeat Response"; flow:established; ssl_version:tls1.1; content:"|18 03 02|"; depth:3; byte_test:2,​>,​200,​3; byte_test:2,​<,​17000,​3; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 600; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001128; rev:8;)
```
```
alert tcp any [!80,​!445] -> any [!80,​!445] (msg:"FOX-SRT - Suspicious - Possible TLSv1.2 Large Heartbeat Response"; flow:established; ssl_version:tls1.2; content:"|18 03 03|"; depth:3; byte_test:2,​>,​200,​3; byte_test:2,​<,​17000,​3; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 600; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001129; rev:8;)
```

The second set has a lower false positive ratio but might also have a slightly lower detection rate:

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"FOX-SRT - Flowbit - TLS-SSL Client Hello"; flow:established; dsize:< 500; content:"|16 03|"; depth:2; byte_test:1,​ <=,​ 2,​ 3; byte_test:1,​ !=,​ 2,​ 1; content:"|01|"; offset:5; depth:1; content:"|03|"; offset:9; byte_test:1,​ <=,​ 3,​ 10; byte_test:1,​ !=,​ 2,​ 9; content:"|00 0f 00|"; flowbits:set,​foxsslsession; flowbits:noalert; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 60; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001130; rev:10;)
```
```
alert_testing tcp any any -> any any (msg:"FOX-SRT - Suspicious - TLS-SSL Large Heartbeat Response"; flow:established; flowbits:isset,​foxsslsession; content:"|18 03|"; depth: 2; byte_test:1,​ <=,​ 3,​ 2; byte_test:1,​ !=,​ 2,​ 1; byte_test:2,​ >,​ 200,​ 3; byte_test:2,​<,​16409,​3; threshold:type limit,​ track by_src,​ count 1,​ seconds 600; reference:cve,​2014-0160; classtype:bad-unknown; sid: 21001131; rev:6;)
```

**Note**: if you want to detect vulnerable SMTP servers that are being exploited via STARTTLS, make sure that you do not have “ignore\_tls\_data” enabled on your SMTP preprocessor.

## Impact

An attacker can retrieve a block of memory of the server up to 64kb. There is no limit on the number of attacks that can be performed. The attacker has no control over the memory region where the block is read from. Sensitive information that can be obtained is:

* SSL private keys
* Basic authorization strings (username / password combinations)
* Source code

This bug affects both sides of the connection. Not only will client certificates not save you from having to update your server certificate, they can be read from the client (along with your username, password etc.) by any server you connect to. DNS poisoning, MitM etc. can be used to direct clients to a malicious server – it seems that this vulnerability can be exploited before the server has to authenticate itself.

According to <http://www.openssl.org/news/openssl-1.0.1-notes.html> the heartbeat extension was introduced in March 2012 with the release of version 1.0.1 of OpenSSL. This implies the vulnerability has been around for 2 years.

## Updates

OpenSSL has provided an updated version (1.0.1g) of OpenSSL at [https://www.openssl.org/source/.](https://www.openssl.org/source/)

Linux distributions are providing updates right now, so check your system for updates. Some Linux distributions have backported the fix to previous versions, ie Debian’s OpenSSL 1.0.1e-2+deb7u5 package has incorporated the fix.

## Examples

When running the ssltest.py script against yahoo.com we were presented with this (censored) output. It shows clearly that the ‘heartbleed bug’ has serious consequences.

    Thanks for sharing these Snort rules.

    As I understand them, you’re only testing the first 5 bytes of the TLS records, hence they should also detect encrypted heartbeat records. Correct?

    To trigger the rule, a heartbeat record has to have more than 200 bytes of data and less than 16385.

    Why do you need this second condition (smaller than 16385)? Isn’t 16384 the maximum size of a TLS record?

     To whom it may concern. the problem lies in mod\_ssl\_with\_npn.so in the spdy package. Just checked out the code, only built the mod\_ssl\_with\_npn.so against a fixed openssl version, replaced it and the problem is solved.

     Just got an update from Filippo, and he pointed me out that SPDY is statically linked in most cases (I totally

     missed that). So you are indeed vulnerable if the test tool says so! But next to upgrading openssl, you also need to rebuild/update mod\_spdy or disable it until it’s fixed up-stream.

     All, after some testing I found out the test tools test your Apache vulnerable when you have the SPDY module enabled even when you have disabled heartbeats or are running a correct version of OpenSSL. I contacted the developer of the original test tool to see why this happens, but until then to be safe, better disable SPDY.

     any idea why the script just stops working and exits after the 8th or 9th hosts?

     f = open(args[0])

     for host in f:

     host = host.strip()

     s = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_STREAM)

     sys.stdout.flush()

     s.settimeout(5)

     try:

     s.connect((host, opts.port))

     except socket.error, e:

     print host + ‘|’ + str(e)

     continue

Repository Manager (VCRM). This bulletin will be revised when the software
updates are released.

Until the software updates are available, HP recommends the following
mitigations and workarounds:

Disable the VCA service name "HP Version Control Agent" on any vulnerable
Windows or Linux server. Disable the VCRM service name "HP Version Control
Repository Manager" on any vulnerable server. Typically, the VCRM is
installed on a HP Systems Insight Manager server, but may be installed on

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

##### Most Frequently Asked Questions

#### [When I use Tor Browser, will anyone be able to tell which websites I visit?](#faq_faq-1)

Tor Browser prevents people from knowing the websites you visit.
Some entities, such as your Internet Service Provider (ISP), may be able to see that you're using Tor, but they won't know where you're going when you do.

  [Permalink](tbb/tbb-3/)

#### [Am I totally anonymous if I use Tor?](#faq_staying-anonymous)

Generally it is impossible to have perfect anonymity, even with Tor.
Though there are some things you can practice to improve your anonymity while using Tor and offline.

### Use Tor Browser and software specifically configured for Tor

Tor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you run it.
Tor only protects applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor.

Web browsing:

* Safe: [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
* Unsafe: [Any other browser configured to use Tor as a proxy](tbb/tbb-9/)

File sharing:

* Safe: [OnionShare](misc/misc-12/)
* Unsafe: [BitTorrent over Tor](misc/misc-4/)

### Control what information you provide through web forms

If you visit a website using Tor Browser, they don't know who you are or your true location.
Unfortunately many sites ask for more personal information than they need through web forms.
If you sign in to that website, they still don't know your location but they know who you are.
Further, if you provide: name, email, address, phone number, or any other personal information, you are no longer anonymous to that website.
The best defense is to be vigilant and extremely cautious when filling out web forms.

### Don't torrent over Tor

Torrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore proxy settings and make direct connections even when they are told to use Tor.
Even if your torrent application connects only through Tor, you will often send out your real IP address in the tracker GET request, because that's how torrents work.
Not only do you [deanonymize your torrent traffic and your other simultaneous Tor web traffic](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea) this way, you also slow down the entire Tor network for everyone else.

### Don't enable or install browser plugins

Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address.
Similarly, we do not recommend [installing additional addons or plugins](tbb/tbb-14/) into Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy.

### Use HTTPS versions of websites

Tor will encrypt your traffic to and within the Tor network, but the encryption of your traffic to the final destination website depends on that website.
To help ensure private encryption to websites, Tor Browser includes [HTTPS-Only Mode](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/secure-connections/#https-only-mode-in-tor-browser) to force the use of HTTPS encryption with websites that support it.
However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a [padlock](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-tell-if-my-connection-is-secure) or [onion icon](onionservices/onionservices-5/) in the address bar, include **https://** in the URL, and display the proper expected name for the website.
Also see EFF's interactive graphic explaining [how Tor and HTTPS relate](https/https-1/).

### Don't open documents downloaded through Tor while online

Tor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are handled by external applications.
**DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING**.
You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files, unless you use the PDF viewer that's built into Tor Browser) as these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them.
This will reveal your non-Tor IP address.
If you must work with files downloaded via Tor, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, or using [dangerzone](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/dangerzone) to create safe PDF files that you can open.
Under no circumstances is it safe to use [BitTorrent and Tor](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea) together, however.

### Use bridges and/or find company

Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to.
However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you're using Tor.
If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a [bridge](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/) rather than connecting directly to the Tor network.
Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them.
Convince other people to use Tor, too!

Be smart and learn more.
Understand what Tor does and does not offer.
This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your help [identifying and documenting all the issues](https://community.torproject.org/).

#### [Which platforms is Tor Browser available for?](#faq_faq-4)

Tor Browser is currently available on [Windows](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [Linux](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [macOS](https://www.torproject.org/download/), and [Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android).

On Android, [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info) also provides the [Orbot app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network.

There is no official version of Tor Browser for iOS yet, as explained in [this blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-browser-and-more-ios-tor/). Our best available recommendation is [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/).

#### [Should I install a new add-on or extension in Tor Browser, like AdBlock Plus or uBlock Origin?](#faq_faq-3)

It's strongly discouraged to install new add-ons in Tor Browser, because they can compromise your privacy and security.

Installing new add-ons may affect Tor Browser in unforeseen ways and potentially make your Tor Browser fingerprint unique.
If your copy of Tor Browser has a unique fingerprint, your browsing activities can be deanonymized and tracked even though you are using Tor Browser.

Each browser's settings and features create what is called a "browser fingerprint".
Most browsers inadvertently create a unique fingerprint for each user which can be tracked across the internet.
Tor Browser is specifically engineered to have a nearly identical (we're not perfect!) fingerprint across its users.
This means each Tor Browser user looks like many other Tor Browser users, making it difficult to track any individual user.

There's also a good chance a new add-on will increase the attack surface of Tor Browser.
This may allow sensitive data to be leaked or allow an attacker to infect Tor Browser.
The add-on itself could even be maliciously designed to spy on you.

Tor Browser already comes installed with one add-on â [NoScript](https://noscript.net) â and adding anything else could deanonymize you.

Want to learn more about browser fingerprinting? Here's an [article](https://blog.torproject.org/browser-fingerprinting-introduction-and-challenges-ahead) on The Tor Blog all about it.

#### [Can I use a VPN with Tor?](#faq_faq-5)

Generally speaking, we don't recommend using a VPN with Tor unless you're an advanced user who knows how to configure both in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy.

You can find more detailed information about Tor + VPN at [our wiki](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN).

#### [Our website is blocked by a censor. Can Tor Browser help users access our website?](#faq_faq-2)

Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked.
Most of the time, simply downloading the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download) and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access.
In places where there is heavy censorship we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including [pluggable transports](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/transports/).

For more information, please see the [Tor Browser User Manual section on censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

  [Permalink](censorship/censorship-1/)

#### [Can I donate for a relay rather than run my own?](#faq_relay-donations)

Sure! We have a [list of organizations that run Tor relays](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/relay-associations/) that are happy to turn your donations into better speed and anonymity for the Tor network.

These organizations are not the same as [The Tor Project, Inc](https://donate.torproject.org/), but we consider that a good thing.
They're run by nice people who are part of the Tor community.

Note that there can be a tradeoff here between anonymity and performance.
The Tor network's anonymity comes in part from diversity, so if you are in a position to run your own relay, you will be improving Tor's anonymity more than by donating.
At the same time though, economies of scale for bandwidth mean that combining many small donations into several larger relays is more efficient at improving network performance.

##### About Tor

#### [What attacks remain against onion routing?](#about_attacks-on-onion-routing)

As mentioned above, it is possible for an observer who can view both you and either the destination website or your Tor exit node to correlate timings of your traffic as it enters the Tor network and also as it exits.
Tor does not defend against such a threat model.

In a more limited sense, note that if a censor or law enforcement agency has the ability to obtain specific observation of parts of the network, it is possible for them to verify a suspicion that you talk regularly to your friend by observing traffic at both ends and correlating the timing of only that traffic.
Again, this is only useful to verify that parties already suspected of communicating with one another are doing so.
In most countries, the suspicion required to obtain a warrant already carries more weight than timing correlation would provide.

Furthermore, since Tor reuses circuits for multiple TCP connections, it is possible to associate non anonymous and anonymous traffic at a given exit node, so be careful about what applications you run concurrently over Tor.
Perhaps even run separate Tor clients for these applications.

#### [What protections does Tor provide?](#about_protections)

Internet communication is based on a store-and-forward model that can be understood in analogy to postal mail: Data is transmitted in blocks called IP datagrams or packets.
Every packet includes a source IP address (of the sender) and a destination IP address (of the receiver), just as ordinary letters contain postal addresses of sender and receiver.
The way from sender to receiver involves multiple hops of routers, where each router inspects the destination IP address and forwards the packet closer to its destination.
Thus, every router between sender and receiver learns that the sender is communicating with the receiver.
In particular, your local ISP is in the position to build a complete profile of your Internet usage.
In addition, every server in the Internet that can see any of the packets can profile your behavior.

The aim of Tor is to improve your privacy by sending your traffic through a series of proxies.
Your communication is encrypted in multiple layers and routed via multiple hops through the Tor network to the final receiver.
More details on this process can be found in this [visualization](https/https-1/).
Note that all your local ISP can observe now is that you are communicating with Tor nodes.
Similarly, servers in the Internet just see that they are being contacted by Tor nodes.

Generally speaking, Tor aims to solve three privacy problems:

First, Tor prevents websites and other services from learning your location, which they can use to build databases about your habits and interests.
With Tor, your Internet connections don't give you away by default -- now you can have the ability to choose, for each connection, how much information to reveal.

Second, Tor prevents people watching your traffic locally (such as your ISP or someone with access to your home wifi or router) from learning what information you're fetching and where you're fetching it from.
It also stops them from deciding what you're allowed to learn and publish -- if you can get to any part of the Tor network, you can reach any site on the Internet.

Third, Tor routes your connection through more than one Tor relay so no single relay can learn what you're up to.
Because these relays are run by different individuals or organizations, distributing trust provides more security than the old [one hop proxy](about/how-is-tor-different-from-other-proxies/) approach.

Note, however, that there are situations where Tor fails to solve these privacy problems entirely: see the entry below on [remaining attacks](about/attacks-on-onion-routing/).

#### [What is Tor?](#about_what-is-tor)

The name "Tor" can refer to several different components.

Tor is a program you can run on your computer that helps keep you safe on the Internet.
It protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.
This set of volunteer relays is called the Tor network.

The way most people use Tor is with Tor Browser, which is a version of Firefox that fixes many privacy issues.
You can read more about Tor on our [about](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/) page.

The Tor Project is a non-profit (charity) organization that maintains and develops the Tor software.

#### [Why is it called Tor?](#about_why-is-it-called-tor)

Tor is the onion routing network.
When we were starting the new next-generation design and implementation of onion routing in 2001-2002, we would tell people we were working on onion routing, and they would say "Neat. Which one?"
Even if onion routing has become a standard household term, Tor was born out of the actual [onion routing project](https://www.onion-router.net/) run by the Naval Research Lab.

(It's also got a fine meaning in German and Turkish.)

Note: even though it originally came from an acronym, Tor is not spelled "TOR".
Only the first letter is capitalized.
In fact, we can usually spot people who haven't read any of our website (and have instead learned everything they know about Tor from news articles) by the fact that they spell it wrong.

#### [Does Tor remove personal information from the data my application sends?](#about_no-data-scrubbing)

No, it doesn't.
You need to use a separate program that understands your application and protocol and knows how to clean or "scrub" the data it sends.
Tor Browser tries to keep application-level data, like the user-agent string, uniform for all users.
Tor Browser can't do anything about the text that you type into forms, though.

#### [How is Tor different from other proxies?](#about_how-is-tor-different-from-other-proxies)

A typical proxy provider sets up a server somewhere on the Internet and allows you to use it to relay your traffic.
This creates a simple, easy to maintain architecture.
The users all enter and leave through the same server.
The provider may charge for use of the proxy, or fund their costs through advertisements on the server.
In the simplest configuration, you don't have to install anything.
You just have to point your browser at their proxy server.
Simple proxy providers are fine solutions if you do not want protections for your privacy and anonymity online and you trust the provider to not do bad things.
Some simple proxy providers use SSL to secure your connection to them, which protects you against local eavesdroppers, such as those at a cafe with free wifi Internet.

Simple proxy providers also create a single point of failure.
The provider knows both who you are and what you browse on the Internet.
They can see your traffic as it passes through their server.
In some cases, they can even see inside your encrypted traffic as they relay it to your banking site or to ecommerce stores.
You have to trust the provider isn't watching your traffic, injecting their own advertisements into your traffic stream, or recording your personal details.

Tor passes your traffic through at least 3 different servers before sending it on to the destination.
Because there's a separate layer of encryption for each of the three relays, somebody watching your Internet connection can't modify, or read, what you are sending into the Tor network.
Your traffic is encrypted between the Tor client (on your computer) and where it pops out somewhere else in the world.

### Doesn't the first server see who I am?

Possibly.
A bad first of three servers can see encrypted Tor traffic coming from your computer.
It still doesn't know who you are and what you are doing over Tor.
It merely sees "This IP address is using Tor".
You are still protected from this node figuring out both who you are and where you are going on the Internet.

### Can't the third server see my traffic?

Possibly.
A bad third of three servers can see the traffic you sent into Tor.
It won't know who sent this traffic.
If you're using encryption (like HTTPS), it will only know the destination.
See this visualization of [Tor and HTTPS](https/https-1/) to understand how Tor and HTTPS interact.

#### [Can I distribute Tor?](#about_distribute-tor)

Yes.

The Tor software is [free software](https://www.fsf.org/).
This means we give you the rights to redistribute the Tor software, either modified or unmodified, either for a fee or gratis.
You don't have to ask us for specific permission.

However, if you want to redistribute the Tor software you must follow our [LICENSE](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/LICENSE).
Essentially this means that you need to include our LICENSE file along with whatever part of the Tor software you're distributing.

Most people who ask us this question don't want to distribute just the Tor software, though.
They want to distribute Tor Browser.
This includes [Firefox Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) and the NoScript extension.
You will need to follow the license for those programs as well.
Both of those Firefox extensions are distributed under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html), while Firefox ESR is released under the Mozilla Public License.
The simplest way to obey their licenses is to include the source code for these programs everywhere you include the bundles themselves.

Also, you should make sure not to confuse your readers about what Tor is, who makes it, and what properties it provides (and doesn't provide).
See our [trademark FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/about/trademark/) for details.

#### [What programs can I use with Tor?](#about_can-i-use-tor-with)

There are plenty of other programs you can use with Tor, but we haven't researched the application-level anonymity issues on all of them well enough to be able to recommend a safe configuration.
Our wiki has a community-maintained list of instructions for [Torifying specific applications](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO).
Please add to this list and help us keep it accurate!

Most people use Tor Browser, which includes everything you need to browse the web safely using Tor.
Using Tor with other browsers is [dangerous and not recommended](tbb/tbb-9/).

#### [Is there a backdoor in Tor?](#about_backdoor)

There is absolutely no backdoor in Tor.

We know some smart lawyers who say that it is unlikely that anybody will try to make us add one in our jurisdiction (United States).
If they do ask us, we will fight them, and (the lawyers say) probably win.

We will never put a backdoor in Tor.
We think that putting a backdoor in Tor would be tremendously irresponsible to our users, and a bad precedent for security software in general.
If we ever put a deliberate backdoor in our security software, it would ruin our professional reputation.
Nobody would trust our software ever again - for excellent reasons!

But that said, there are still plenty of subtle attacks people might try.
Somebody might impersonate us, or break into our computers, or something like that.
Tor is open source, and you should always check the source (or at least the diffs since the last release) for suspicious things.
If we (or the distributors that gave you Tor) don't give you access to the source code, that's a sure sign something funny might be going on.
You should also check the [PGP signatures](tbb/how-to-verify-signature/) on the releases, to make sure nobody messed with the distribution sites.

Also, there might be accidental bugs in Tor that could affect your anonymity.
We periodically find and fix anonymity-related bugs, so make sure you keep your Tor versions up-to-date.

#### [What are Entry Guards?](#about_entry-guards)

Tor (like all current practical low-latency anonymity designs) fails when the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel.
For example, suppose the attacker controls or watches the Tor relay you choose to enter the network, and also controls or watches the website you visit.
In this case, the research community knows no practical low-latency design that can reliably stop the attacker from correlating volume and timing information on the two sides.

So, what should we do?
Suppose the attacker controls, or can observe, C relays.
Suppose there are N relays total.
If you select new entry and exit relays each time you use the network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send with probability around (c/n)^2.
But profiling is, for most users, as bad as being traced all the time: they want to do something often without an attacker noticing, and the attacker noticing once is as bad as the attacker noticing more often.
Thus, choosing many random entries and exits gives the user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker.

The solution is "entry guards": each Tor client selects a few relays at random to use as entry points, and uses only those relays for their first hop.
If those relays are not controlled or observed, the attacker can't win, ever, and the user is secure.
If those relays are observed or controlled by the attacker, the attacker sees a larger fraction of the user's traffic - but still the user is no more profiled than before.
Thus, the user has some chance (on the order of (n-c)/n) of avoiding profiling, whereas they had none before.

You can read more at [An Analysis of the Degradation of Anonymous Protocols](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wright02), [Defending Anonymous Communication Against Passive Logging Attacks](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wright03), and especially [Locating Hidden Servers](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#hs-attack06).

Restricting your entry nodes may also help against attackers who want to run a few Tor nodes and easily enumerate all of the Tor user IP addresses.
(Even though they can't learn what destinations the users are talking to, they still might be able to do bad things with just a list of users.)
However, that feature won't really become useful until we move to a "directory guard" design as well.

#### [Tell me about all the keys Tor uses](#about_key-management)

Tor uses a variety of different keys, with three goals in mind: 1) encryption to ensure privacy of data within the Tor network, 2) authentication so clients know they're talking to the relays they meant to talk to, and 3) signatures to make sure all clients know the same set of relays.

**Encryption**: first, all connections in Tor use TLS link encryption, so observers can't look inside to see which circuit a given cell is intended for.
Further, the Tor client establishes an ephemeral encryption key with each relay in the circuit; these extra layers of encryption mean that only the exit relay can read the cells.
Both sides discard the circuit key when the circuit ends, so logging traffic and then breaking into the relay to discover the key won't work.

**Authentication**: Every Tor relay has a public decryption key called the "onion key".
Each relay rotates its onion key every four weeks.
When the Tor client establishes circuits, at each step it [demands that the Tor relay prove knowledge of its onion key](https://svn-archive.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.html#subsec:circuits).
That way the first node in the path can't just spoof the rest of the path.
Because the Tor client chooses the path, it can make sure to get Tor's "distributed trust" property: no single relay in the path can know about both the client and what the client is doing.

**Coordination**: How do clients know what the relays are, and how do they know that they have the right keys for them?
Each relay has a long-term public signing key called the "identity key".
Each directory authority additionally has a "directory signing key".
The directory authorities [provide a signed list](https://spec.torproject.org/dir-spec) of all the known relays, and in that list are a set of certificates from each relay (self-signed by their identity key) specifying their keys, locations, exit policies, and so on.
So unless the adversary can control a majority of the directory authorities (as of 2022 there are 8 directory authorities), they can't trick the Tor client into using other Tor relays.

### How do clients know what the directory authorities are?

The Tor software comes with a built-in list of location and public key for each directory authority.
So the only way to trick users into using a fake Tor network is to give them a specially modified version of the software.

### How do users know they've got the right software?

When we distribute the source code or a package, we digitally sign it with [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/).
See the [instructions on how to check Tor Browser's signature](tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

In order to be certain that it's really signed by us, you need to have met us in person and gotten a copy of our GPG key fingerprint, or you need to know somebody who has.
If you're concerned about an attack on this level, we recommend you get involved with the security community and start meeting people.

#### [How often does Tor change its paths?](#about_change-paths)

Tor will reuse the same circuit for new TCP streams for 10 minutes, as long as the circuit is working fine.
(If the circuit fails, Tor will switch to a new circuit immediately.)

But note that a single TCP stream (e.g. a long IRC connection) will stay on the same circuit forever.
We don't rotate individual streams from one circuit to the next.
Otherwise, an adversary with a partial view of the network would be given many chances over time to link you to your destination, rather than just one chance.

##### Tor Browser

#### [How can I verify Tor Browser's signature?](#tbb_how-to-verify-signature)

Digital signature is a process ensuring that a certain package was generated by its developers and has not been tampered with.
Below we explain why it is important and how to verify that the Tor Browser you download is the one we have created and has not been modified by some attacker.

Each file on our [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/) is accompanied by a file labelled "signature" with the same name as the package and the extension ".asc". These .asc files are OpenPGP signatures.
They allow you to verify the file you've downloaded is exactly the one that we intended you to get.
This will vary by web browser, but generally you can download this file by right-clicking the "signature" link and selecting the "save file as" option.

For example, `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-13.0.1.exe` is accompanied by `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-13.0.1.exe.asc`.
These are example file names and will not exactly match the file names that you download.

We now show how you can verify the downloaded file's digital signature on different operating systems.
Please notice that a signature is dated the moment the package has been signed.
Therefore every time a new file is uploaded a new signature is generated with a different date.
As long as you have verified the signature you should not worry that the reported date may vary.

### Installing GnuPG

First of all you need to have GnuPG installed before you can verify signatures.

#### For Windows users:

If you run Windows, [download Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html) and run its installer.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in windows command-line, `cmd.exe`.

#### For macOS users:

If you are using macOS, you can [install GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org).

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in the Terminal (under "Applications").

#### For GNU/Linux users:

If you are using GNU/Linux, then you probably already have GnuPG in your system, as most GNU/Linux distributions come with it preinstalled.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in a terminal window. How to do this will vary depending on your distribution.

### Fetching the Tor Developers key

The Tor Browser team signs Tor Browser releases.
Import the Tor Browser Developers signing key (0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290):

```
gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org

```

This should show you something like:

```
gpg: key 4E2C6E8793298290: public key "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
      EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
uid           [ unknown] Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>

```

NOTE: Your output may deviate somewhat from the above (eg. expiration dates), however you should see the key correctly imported.

If you get an error message, something has gone wrong and you cannot continue until you've figured out why this didn't work. You might be able to import the key using the **Workaround (using a public key)** section instead.

After importing the key, you can save it to a file (identifying it by its fingerprint here):

```
gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

```

This command results in the key being saved to a file found at the path `./tor.keyring`, i.e. in the current directory.
If `./tor.keyring` doesn't exist after running this command, something has gone wrong and you cannot continue until you've figured out why this didn't work.

### Verifying the signature

To verify the signature of the package you downloaded, you will need to download the corresponding ".asc" signature file as well as the installer file itself, and verify it with a command that asks GnuPG to verify the file that you downloaded.

The examples below assume that you downloaded these two files to your "Downloads" folder.
Note that these commands use example file names and yours will be different: you will need to replace the example file names with exact names of the files you have downloaded.

#### For Windows users (change x86\_64 to i686 if you have the 32-bit package):

```
gpgv --keyring .\tor.keyring Downloads\tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-13.0.1.exe.asc Downloads\tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-13.0.1.exe

```
#### For macOS users:

```
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-browser-macos-13.0.1.dmg.asc ~/Downloads/tor-browser-macos-13.0.1.dmg

```
#### For GNU/Linux users (change x86\_64 to i686 if you have the 32-bit package):

```
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.0.1.tar.xz.asc ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-13.0.1.tar.xz

```

The result of the command should contain:

```
gpgv: Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>"

```

If you get error messages containing 'No such file or directory', either something went wrong with one of the previous steps, or you forgot that these commands use example file names and yours will be a little different.

#### Refreshing the PGP key

Run the following command to refresh the Tor Browser Developers signing key in your local keyring from the keyserver. This will also fetch the new subkeys.

```
gpg --refresh-keys EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

```
#### Workaround (using a public key)

If you encounter errors you cannot fix, feel free to [download and use this public key](https://openpgpkey.torproject.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/torproject.org/hu/kounek7zrdx745qydx6p59t9mqjpuhdf) instead. Alternatively, you may use the following command:

```
curl -s https://openpgpkey.torproject.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/torproject.org/hu/kounek7zrdx745qydx6p59t9mqjpuhdf |gpg --import -

```

Tor Browser Developers key is also available on [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/) and can be downloaded from <https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290>.
If you're using MacOS or GNU/Linux, the key can also be fetched by running the following command:

```
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --search-keys EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290

```

#### [I downloaded and installed Tor Browser for Windows, but now I can't find it.](#tbb_tbb-11)

The file you download and run prompts you for a destination.
If you don't remember what this destination was, it's most likely your Downloads or Desktop folder.

The default setting in the Windows installer also creates a shortcut for you on your Desktop, though be aware that you may have accidentally deselected the option to create a shortcut.

If you can't find it in either of those folders, download it again and look for the prompt that asks you to choose a directory to download it in.
Choose a directory location that you'll remember easily, and once the download finishes you should see a Tor Browser folder there.

#### [Are there any paid versions of Tor Browser?](#tbb_fake-tbb)

No, Tor Browser is an open source software and it is free.
Any browser forcing you to pay and is claiming to be Tor Browser is fake.
To make sure you are downloading the right Tor Browser visit our [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/).
After downloading, you can make sure that you have the official version of Tor Browser by [verifying the signature](tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).
If you are not able to access our website, then visit [censorship section](censorship/gettor-1/) to get information about alternate way of downloading Tor Browser.

If you have paid for a fake app claiming to be Tor Browser, you can try to request a refund from the Apple or Play Store, or you can contact your bank to report a fraudulent transaction.
We cannot refund you for a purchase made to another company.

You can report fake Tor Browsers on frontdesk@torproject.org

#### [Which platforms is Tor Browser available for?](#tbb_tbb-31)

Tor Browser is currently available on [Windows](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [Linux](https://www.torproject.org/download/), [macOS](https://www.torproject.org/download/), and [Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android).

On Android, [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info) also provides the [Orbot app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network.

There is no official version of Tor Browser for iOS yet, as explained in [this blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-browser-and-more-ios-tor/). Our best available recommendation is [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/).

#### [Can I download Tor Browser for Chrome OS?](#tbb_tbb-15)

Unfortunately, we don't yet have a version of Tor Browser for Chrome OS.
You could run [Tor Browser for Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android) on Chrome OS. Note that by using Tor Mobile on Chrome OS, you will view the mobile (not desktop) versions of websites.
However, because we have not audited the app in Chrome OS, we don't know if all the privacy features of Tor Browser for Android will work well.

#### [How can I make Tor run faster? Is Tor Browser slower than other browsers?](#tbb_tbb-22)

Using Tor Browser can sometimes be slower than other browsers.
The Tor network has over a million daily users, and just over 6000 relays to route all of their traffic, and the load on each server can sometimes cause latency. And, by design, your traffic is bouncing through volunteers' servers in various parts of the world, and some bottlenecks and network latency will always be present.
You can help improve the speed of the network by [running your own relay](https://community.torproject.org/relay/), or encouraging others to do so.
For the much more in-depth answer, see [Roger's blog post on the topic](https://blog.torproject.org/why-tor-slow-and-what-were-going-do-about-it/) and [Tor's Open Research Topics: 2018 edition](https://blog.torproject.org/tors-open-research-topics-2018-edition/) about Network Performance.
You can also checkout our recent blog post [Tor Network Defense Against Ongoing Attacks](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/), which discusses the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the Tor Network.
Furthermore, we have introduced a [Proof-of-Work Defense for Onion Services](https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/) to help mitigate some of these attacks.
That said, Tor is much faster than it used to be and you may not actually notice any change in speed from other browsers.

#### [What is the difference between using Tor Browser and 'Incognito mode' or private tabs?](#tbb_tbb-and-incognito-mode)

While the names may imply otherwise, 'Incognito mode' and 'private tabs' do not make you anonymous on the Internet.
They erase all the information on your machine relating to the browsing session after they are closed, but have no measures in place to hide your activity or digital fingerprint online.
This means that an observer can collect your traffic just as easily as any regular browser.

Tor Browser offers all the amnesic features of private tabs while also hiding the source IP, browsing habits and details about a device that can be used to fingerprint activity across the web, allowing for a truly private browsing session that's fully obfuscated from end-to-end.

For more information regarding the limitations of Incognito mode and private tabs, see Mozilla's article on [Common Myths about Private Browsing](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/common-myths-about-private-browsing).

#### [Can I set Tor Browser as my default browser?](#tbb_tbb-32)

There are methods for setting Tor Browser as your default browser, but those methods may not work always or in every operating system.
Tor Browser works hard to isolate itself from the rest of your system, and the steps for making it the default browser are unreliable.
This means sometimes a website would load in Tor Browser, and sometimes it would load in another browser. This type of behavior can be dangerous and break anonymity.

#### [Can I use Tor with a browser besides Tor Browser?](#tbb_tbb-9)

We strongly recommend against using Tor in any browser other than Tor Browser.
Using Tor in another browser can leave you vulnerable without the privacy protections of Tor Browser.

#### [Can I still use another browser, like Chrome or Firefox, when I am using Tor Browser?](#tbb_tbb-5)

You can certainly use another browser while you are also using Tor Browser.
However, you should know that the privacy properties of Tor Browser will not be present in the other browser.
Be careful when switching back and forth between Tor and a less safe browser, because you may accidentally use the other browser for something you intended to do using Tor.

#### [Is it safe to run Tor Browser and another browser at the same time?](#tbb_tbb-17)

If you run Tor Browser and another browser at the same time, it won't affect Tor's performance or privacy properties.

However, be aware that when using Tor and another browser at the same time, your Tor activity could be linked to your non-Tor (real) IP from the other browser, simply by moving your mouse from one browser into the other.

Or you may simply forget and accidentally use that non-private browser to do something that you intended to do in Tor Browser instead.

#### [Does using Tor Browser protect other applications on my computer?](#tbb_tbb-13)

Only Tor Browser's traffic will be routed over the Tor network.
Any other application on your system (including other browsers) will not have their connections routed over the Tor network, and will not be protected.
They need to be configured separately to use Tor.
If you need to be sure that all traffic will go through the Tor network, take a look at the [Tails live operating system](https://tails.net/) which you can start on almost any computer from a USB stick or a DVD.

#### [Why does my Tor Browser say something about Firefox not working?](#tbb_tbb-42)

Tor Browser is built using [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/), so errors regarding Firefox may occur.
Please be sure no other instance of Tor Browser is already running, and that you have extracted Tor Browser in a location that your user has the correct permissions for.
If you are running an anti-virus, please see [My antivirus/malware protection is blocking me from accessing Tor Browser](tbb/tbb-10/), it is common for anti-virus/anti-malware software to cause this type of issue.

#### [Why is Tor Browser built from Firefox and not some other browser?](#tbb_tbb-4)

Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox specifically designed for use with Tor.
A lot of work has been put into making Tor Browser, including the use of extra patches to enhance privacy and security.
While it is technically possible to use Tor with other browsers, you may open yourself up to potential attacks or information leakage, so we strongly discourage it.

#### [How can I export and import bookmarks in Tor Browser?](#tbb_export-and-import-bookmarks)

Bookmarks in Tor Browser for Desktop can be exported, imported, backed up, restored as well as imported from another browser.
The instructions are similar on Windows, macOS and Linux.
In order to manage your bookmarks in Tor Browser, go to:

* Hamburger menu >> Bookmarks >> Manage bookmarks (below the menu)
* From the toolbar on the Library window, click on the option to 'Import and Backup'.

**If you wish to export bookmarks**

* Choose Export Bookmarks to HTML
* In the Export Bookmarks File window that opens, choose a location to save the file, which is named bookmarks.html by default. The desktop is usually a good spot, but any place that is easy to remember will work.
* Click the Save button. The Export Bookmarks File window will close.
* Close the Library window.

> Your bookmarks are now successfully exported from Tor Browser.
> The bookmarks HTML file you saved is now ready to be imported into another web browser.

**If you wish to import bookmarks**

* Choose Import Bookmarks from HTML
* Within the Import Bookmarks File window that opens, navigate to the bookmarks HTML file you are importing and select the file.
* Click the Open button. The Import Bookmarks File window will close.
* Close the Library window.

> The bookmarks in the selected HTML file will be added to your Tor Browser within the Bookmarks Menu directory.

**If you wish to backup**

* Choose Backup
* A new window opens and you have to choose the location to save the file. The file has a .json extension.

**If you wish to restore**

* Choose Restore and then select the bookmark file you wish to restore.
* Click okay to the pop up box that appears and hurray, you just restored your backup bookmark.

**Import bookmarks from another browser**

> Bookmarks can be transferred from Firefox to Tor Browser. There are two ways to export and import bookmarks in Firefox: [HTML file](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer) or JSON file.
> After exporting the data from the browser, follow the above steps to import the bookmark file into your Tor Browser.

**Note:** Currently, on [Tor Browser for Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android), there is no good way to export and import bookmarks. [Bug #31617](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/31617)

#### [How do I view Tor Browser message log?](#tbb_tbb-21)

When you have Tor Browser open, you can navigate to the [hamburger menu ("â¡")](glossary/hamburger-menu), then click on "Settings", and finally on "Connection" in the side bar.
At the bottom of the page, next to the "View the Tor logs" text, click the button "View Logs...".
You should see an option to copy the log to your clipboard, which you will be able to paste it into a text editor or an email client.

Alternatively, on GNU/Linux, to view the logs right in the terminal, navigate to the Tor Browser directory and launch Tor Browser from the command line by running:

âª`./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose`

or to save the logs to a file *(default: tor-browser.log)*

âª`./start-tor-browser.desktop --log [file]`

#### [Why are there margins on a resized Tor Browser window?](#tbb_maximized-torbrowser-window)

Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px to prevent fingerprinting of the screen dimensions.
This is an anti-fingerprinting feature in Tor Browser called [Letterboxing](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/#letterboxing).

#### [Our website is blocked by a censor. Can Tor Browser help users access our website?](#tbb_tbb-8)

Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked.
Most of the time, simply downloading the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download) and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access.
In places where there is heavy censorship we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including [pluggable transports](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/transports/).

For more information, please see the [Tor Browser User Manual section on censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

#### [A website I am trying to reach is blocking access over Tor.](#tbb_website-blocking-tor)

Sometimes websites will block Tor users because they can't tell the difference between the average Tor user and automated traffic.
The best success we've had in getting sites to unblock Tor users is getting users to contact the site administrators directly.
Something like this might do the trick:

"Hi! I tried to access your site xyz.com while using Tor Browser and discovered that you don't allow Tor users to access your site.
I urge you to reconsider this decision; Tor is used by people all over the world to protect their privacy and fight censorship.
By blocking Tor users, you are likely blocking people in repressive countries who want to use a free internet, journalists and researchers who want to protect themselves from discovery, whistleblowers, activists, and ordinary people who want to opt out of invasive third party tracking.
Please take a strong stance in favor of digital privacy and internet freedom, and allow Tor users access to xyz.com. Thank you."

In the case of banks, and other sensitive websites, it is also common to see geography-based blocking (if a bank knows you generally access their services from one country, and suddenly you are connecting from an exit relay on the other side of the world, your account may be locked or suspended).

If you are unable to connect to an onion service, please see [I cannot reach X.onion!](onionservices/onionservices-3).

#### [A website (bank, email provider, etc.) locks me out whenever I use Tor, what can I do?](#tbb_tbb-30)

Tor Browser often makes your connection appear as though it is coming from an entirely different part of the world.
Some websites, such as banks or email providers, might interpret this as a sign that your account has been compromised, and lock you out.

The only way to resolve this is by following the site's recommended procedure for account recovery, or contacting the operators and explaining the situation.

You may be able to avoid this scenario if your provider offers 2-factor authentication, which is a much better security option than IP-based reputations.
Contact your provider and ask them if they provide 2FA.

#### [My antivirus or malware protection is blocking me from accessing Tor Browser.](#tbb_tbb-10)

Most antivirus or malware protection allows the user to "allowlist" certain processes that would otherwise be blocked.
Please open your antivirus or malware protection software and look in the settings for an "allowlist" or something similar.
Next, include the following processes:

* For Windows
  + firefox.exe
  + tor.exe
  + lyrebird.exe (if you use bridges)
  + snowflake-client.exe

* For macOS
  + TorBrowser
  + tor.real
  + lyrebird (if you use bridges)
  + snowflake-client

Finally, restart Tor Browser.
This should fix the issues you're experiencing.
Please note that some antivirus clients, like Kaspersky, may also be blocking Tor at the firewall level.

#### [Tor Browser can't connect. Is my network censored?](#tbb_tbb-19)

If you have exhausted general [troubleshooting](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/troubleshooting/) steps, it's possible that your connection to Tor is censored.
In that case, connecting with one of the [built-in censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) methods in Tor Browser can help.
[Connection Assist](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/) can automatically choose one for you using your location.

If Connection Assist is unable to facilitate the connection to Tor, you can configure Tor Browser to use one of the built-in circumvention methods manually.
To use bridges and access other censorship circumvention related settings, click "Configure Connection" when starting Tor Browser for the first time.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
From the menu, select a [censorship circumvention method](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

Or, if you have Tor Browser running, click on "Settings" in the hamburger menu (â¡) and then on "Connection" in the sidebar.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
Select a censorship circumvention method from the menu.
Your settings will automatically be saved once you close the tab.

If Tor fails to connect, you might have to try other methods of getting bridges.
Please refer to the [Tor Browser User Manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges) for further instructions and more information about bridges.
If you have Tor Browser installed type `about:manual#bridges` in the address bar of Tor Browser to read the offline manual.

#### [Gmail warns me that my account may have been compromised](#tbb_tbb-45)

Sometimes, after you've used Gmail over Tor, Google presents a pop-up notification that your account may have been compromised.
The notification window lists a series of IP addresses and locations throughout the world recently used to access your account.

In general, this is a false alarm: Google saw a bunch of logins from different places, as a result of running the service via Tor, and decided it was a good idea to confirm the account was being accessed by its rightful owner.

Even though this may be a byproduct of using the service via Tor, that doesn't mean you can entirely ignore the warning.
It is probably a false positive, but it might not be since it is possible for someone to hijack your Google cookie.

Cookie hijacking is possible by either physical access to your computer or by watching your network traffic.
In theory, only physical access should compromise your system because Gmail and similar services should only send the cookie over an SSL link.
In practice, alas, it's [way more complex than that](https://web.archive.org/web/20200404010719/https%3A//fscked.org/blog/fully-automated-active-https-cookie-hijacking).

And if somebody did steal your Google cookie, they might end up logging in from unusual places (though of course they also might not). So the summary is that since you're using Tor Browser, this security measure that Google uses isn't so useful for you, because it's full of false positives. You'll have to use other approaches, like seeing if anything looks weird on the account, or looking at the timestamps for recent logins and wondering if you actually logged in at those times.

More recently, Gmail users can turn on [2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839) on their accounts to add an extra layer of security.

#### [Google makes me solve a Captcha or tells me I have spyware installed](#tbb_tbb-44)

This is a known and intermittent problem; it does not mean that Google considers Tor to be spyware.

When you use Tor, you are sending queries through exit relays that are also shared by thousands of other users. Tor users typically see this message when many Tor users are querying Google in a short period of time. Google interprets the high volume of traffic from a single IP address (the exit relay you happened to pick) as somebody trying to "crawl" their website, so it slows down traffic from that IP address for a short time.

You can try 'New Circuit for this Site' to access the website from a different IP address.

An alternate explanation is that Google tries to detect certain kinds of spyware or viruses that send distinctive queries to Google Search. It notes the IP addresses from which those queries are received (not realizing that they are Tor exit relays), and tries to warn any connections coming from those IP addresses that recent queries indicate an infection.

To our knowledge, Google is not doing anything intentionally specifically to deter or block Tor use. The error message about an infected machine should clear up again after a short time.

#### [Can you get rid of all the Captchas?](#tbb_tbb-35)

Unfortunately, some websites deliver Captchas to Tor users, and we are not able to remove Captchas from websites.
The best thing to do in these cases is to contact the website owners, and inform them that their Captchas are preventing users such as yourself from using their services.

#### [Why does Google show up in foreign languages?](#tbb_tbb-43)

Google uses "geolocation" to determine where in the world you are, so it can give you a personalized experience. This includes using the language it thinks you prefer, and it also includes giving you different results on your queries.

If you really want to see Google in English you can click the link that provides that. But we consider this a feature with Tor, not a bug --- the Internet is not flat, and it in fact does look different depending on where you are. This feature reminds people of this fact.

Note that Google search URLs take name/value pairs as arguments and one of those names is "hl". If you set "hl" to "en" then Google will return search results in English regardless of what Google server you have been sent to. The changed link might look like this:

<https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=online%20anonymity&hl=en>

Another method is to simply use your country code for accessing Google. This can be google.be, google.de, google.us and so on.

#### [What search engine comes with Tor Browser and how does it protect my privacy?](#tbb_tbb-23)

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is the default search engine in Tor Browser.
DuckDuckGo does not track its users nor does it store any data about user searches. Learn more about [DuckDuckGo privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy).

#### [Why did my search engine switch to DuckDuckGo?](#tbb_tbb-41)

With the release of Tor Browser 6.0.6, we switched to DuckDuckGo as the primary search engine.
For a while now, Disconnect, which was formerly used in Tor Browser, has had no access to Google search results.
Since Disconnect is more of a meta search engine, which allows users to choose between different search providers, it fell back to delivering Bing search results, which were basically unacceptable quality-wise.
DuckDuckGo does not log, collect or share the user's personal information or their search history, and therefore is best positioned to protect your privacy.
Most other search engines store your searches along with other information such as the timestamp, your IP address, and your account information if you are logged in.

#### [Is there a way to change the IP address that Tor Browser assigns me for a particular site?](#tbb_tbb-29)

Tor Browser has two ways to change your relay circuit â "New Identity" and "New Tor Circuit for this Site".
Both options are located in the [hamburger menu ("â¡")](glossary/hamburger-menu).
You can also access the New Circuit option inside the site information menu in the URL bar, and the New Identity option by clicking the small sparky broom icon at the top-right of the screen.

#### New Identity

This option is useful if you want to prevent your subsequent browser activity from being linkable to what you were doing before.

Selecting it will close all your tabs and windows, clear all private information such as cookies and browsing history, and use new Tor circuits for all connections.

Tor Browser will warn you that all activity and downloads will be stopped, so take this into account before clicking "New Identity".

![Tor Browser Menu](static/images/menu-new-identity.png)

#### New Tor Circuit for this Site

This option is useful if the exit relay you are using is unable to connect to the website you require, or is not loading it properly.
Selecting it will cause the currently-active tab or window to be reloaded over a new Tor circuit.

Other open tabs and windows from the same website will use the new circuit as well once they are reloaded.

This option does not clear any private information or unlink your activity, nor does it affect your current connections to other websites.

#### [Does running Tor Browser make me a relay?](#tbb_tbb-33)

Running Tor Browser does not make you act as a relay in the network.
This means that your computer will not be used to route traffic for others.
If you'd like to become a relay, please see our [Tor Relay Guide](https://community.torproject.org/relay).

#### [Why is the first IP address in my relay circuit always the same?](#tbb_tbb-2)

That is normal Tor behavior.
The first relay in your circuit is called an "entry guard" or "guard".
It is a fast and stable relay that remains the first one in your circuit for 2-3 months in order to protect against a known anonymity-breaking attack.
The rest of your circuit changes with every new website you visit, and all together these relays provide the full privacy protections of Tor.
For more information on how guard relays work, see this [blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters) and [paper](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~hoppernj/single_guard.pdf) on entry guards.

#### [Does Tor Browser use a different circuit for each website?](#tbb_tbb-40)

#### [Can I pick which country I'm exiting from?](#tbb_tbb-16)

Modifying the way that Tor creates its circuits is strongly discouraged.
You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry/exit nodes can compromise your anonymity.
If the outcome you want is simply to be able to access resources that are only available in one country, you may want to consider using a VPN instead of using Tor.
Please note that VPNs do not have the same privacy properties as Tor, but they will help solve some geolocation restriction issues.

#### [I'm supposed to "edit my torrc". What does that mean?](#tbb_tbb-editing-torrc)

WARNING: Do NOT follow random advice instructing you to edit your `torrc`!
Doing so can allow an attacker to compromise your security and anonymity through malicious configuration of your `torrc`.

Tor uses a text file called `torrc` that contains configuration instructions for how Tor should behave.
The default configuration should work fine for most Tor users (hence the warning above.)

To find your Tor Browser `torrc`, follow the instructions for your operating system below.

On Windows or Linux:

* The `torrc` is in the Tor Browser Data directory at `Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor` inside your Tor Browser directory.

On macOS:

* The `torrc` is in the Tor Browser Data directory at `~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor`.
* Note the Library folder is hidden on newer versions of macOS. To navigate to this folder in Finder, select "Go to Folder..." in the "Go" menu.
* Then type `~/Library/Application Support/` in the window and click Go.

Close Tor Browser before you edit your `torrc`, otherwise Tor Browser may erase your modifications.
Some options will have no effect as Tor Browser overrides them with command line options when it starts Tor.

Have a look at the [sample `torrc`](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/blob/HEAD/src/config/torrc.sample.in) file for hints on common configurations.
For other configuration options you can use, see the [Tor manual page](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en).
Remember, all lines beginning with `#` in torrc are treated as comments and have no effect on Tor's configuration.

#### [Should I install a new add-on or extension in Tor Browser, like AdBlock Plus or uBlock Origin?](#tbb_tbb-14)

It's strongly discouraged to install new add-ons in Tor Browser, because they can compromise your privacy and security.

Installing new add-ons may affect Tor Browser in unforeseen ways and potentially make your Tor Browser fingerprint unique.
If your copy of Tor Browser has a unique fingerprint, your browsing activities can be deanonymized and tracked even though you are using Tor Browser.

Each browser's settings and features create what is called a "browser fingerprint".
Most browsers inadvertently create a unique fingerprint for each user which can be tracked across the internet.
Tor Browser is specifically engineered to have a nearly identical (we're not perfect!) fingerprint across its users.
This means each Tor Browser user looks like many other Tor Browser users, making it difficult to track any individual user.

There's also a good chance a new add-on will increase the attack surface of Tor Browser.
This may allow sensitive data to be leaked or allow an attacker to infect Tor Browser.
The add-on itself could even be maliciously designed to spy on you.

Tor Browser already comes installed with one add-on â [NoScript](https://noscript.net) â and adding anything else could deanonymize you.

Want to learn more about browser fingerprinting? Here's an [article](https://blog.torproject.org/browser-fingerprinting-introduction-and-challenges-ahead) on The Tor Blog all about it.

#### [Can I use Flash in Tor Browser?](#tbb_tbb-12)

Fortunately, most websites, devices, and other browsers are moving away from the use of Flash.

#### [My internet connection requires an HTTP or SOCKS Proxy](#tbb_tbb-47)

If you're using Tor Browser, you can set your proxy's address, port, and authentication information in the [Connection Settings](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/).

If you're using Tor another way, you can set the proxy information in your torrc file. Check out the `HTTPSProxy` config option in the [manual page](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#HTTPSProxy). If your proxy requires authentication, see the `HTTPSProxyAuthenticator` option. Example with authentication:

```
  HTTPSProxy 10.0.0.1:8080
  HTTPSProxyAuthenticator myusername:mypass

```

We only support Basic auth currently, but if you need NTLM authentication, you may find [this post in the archives](https://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jun-2005/msg00223.html) useful.

For using a SOCKS proxy, see the `Socks4Proxy`, `Socks5Proxy`, and related torrc options in the [manual page](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#Socks4Proxy). Using a SOCKS 5 proxy with authentication might look like this:

```
  Socks5Proxy 10.0.0.1:1080
  Socks5ProxyUsername myuser
  Socks5ProxyPassword mypass

```

If your proxies only allow you to connect to certain ports, look at the entry on [Firewalled](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#FirewallPorts) clients for how to restrict what ports your Tor will try to access.

#### [I want to run my Tor client on a different computer than my applications](#tbb_tbb-run-client-different-computer)

By default, your Tor client only listens for applications that connect from localhost.
Connections from other computers are refused.
If you want to torify applications on different computers than the Tor client, you should edit your torrc to define `SocksListenAddress 0.0.0.0` and then restart (or hup) Tor.
If you want to get more advanced, you can configure your Tor client on a firewall to bind to your internal IP but not your external IP.

#### [Can I install Tor on a central server, and have my clients connect to it?](#tbb_tbb-install-tor-central-server)

Yes. Tor can be configured as a client or a relay on another machine, and allow other machines to be able to connect to it for anonymity.
This is most useful in an environment where many computers want a gateway of anonymity to the rest of the world.
However, be forewarned that with this configuration, anyone within your private network (existing between you and the Tor client/relay) can see what traffic you are sending in clear text.
The anonymity doesn't start until you get to the Tor relay.
Because of this, if you are the controller of your domain and you know everything's locked down, you will be OK, but this configuration may not be suitable for large private networks where security is key all around.

Configuration is simple, editing your torrc file's SocksListenAddress according to the following examples:

```
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1

```
```
SocksListenAddress 192.168.x.x:9100

```
```
SocksListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9100

```

You can state multiple listen addresses, in the case that you are part of several networks or subnets.

```
SocksListenAddress 192.168.x.x:9100 #eth0
SocksListenAddress 10.x.x.x:9100 #eth1

```

After this, your clients on their respective networks/subnets would specify a socks proxy with the address and port you specified SocksListenAddress to be.
Please note that the SocksPort configuration option gives the port ONLY for localhost (127.0.0.1).
When setting up your SocksListenAddress(es), you need to give the port with the address, as shown above.
If you are interested in forcing all outgoing data through the central Tor client/relay, instead of the server only being an optional proxy, you may find the program iptables (for \*nix) useful.

#### [Why does Tor Browser ship with JavaScript enabled?](#tbb_tbb-34)

We configure NoScript to allow JavaScript by default in Tor Browser because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled.
Most users would give up on Tor entirely if we disabled JavaScript by default because it would cause so many problems for them.
Ultimately, we want to make Tor Browser as secure as possible while also making it usable for the majority of people, so for now, that means leaving JavaScript enabled by default.

For users who want to have JavaScript disabled on all HTTP sites by default, we recommend changing your Tor Browser's [Security Levels](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/) option.
This can be done by clicking on the Security level icon (the shield right next to the URL bar) and then clicking on "Settings...".
The "Standard" level allows JavaScript, the "Safer" level blocks JavaScript on HTTP sites and the "Safest" level blocks JavaScript altogether.

#### [Why is Tor Browser dropping support for legacy operating systems?](#tbb_tor-browser-and-legacy-os)

Legacy operating systems are unsupported versions of operating systems.
For instance, Microsoft ended official support for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 in January of 2023.
Legacy unsupported operating systems receive no security updates and may have known security vulnerabilities.
With no official support and Firefox (Tor Browser is based on Firefox ESR) dropping support for legacy operating systems, maintaining Tor Browser for obsolete operating systems becomes unfeasible and a security risk for users.

Support for Windows 8.1 or lower and macOS 10.14 or lower will be discontinued with the release of Tor Browser 14, scheduled for the end of 2024.
Users on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 and macOS 10.12 to 10.14 will continue receiving security updates for Tor Browser 13.5 for a limited time until at least March of 2025, pending a [re-](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-users-windows-7-8-and-81-moving-extended-support)[evaluation](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-users-macos-1012-1013-1014-moving-to-extended-support) by Firefox.

Users on legacy operating systems are strongly advised to upgrade their operating system for access to Tor Browser 14 and later and for the latest security updates and new features in Tor Browser.
Windows users are recommended to upgrade to Windows 10 or 11.
macOS users are recommended to upgrade to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.
In some cases, it may require newer hardware in order to support the newer operating system.

#### [Can I run Tor Browser on an iOS device?](#tormobile_tormobile-3)

We recommend iOS apps [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/) and [Orbot](https://orbot.app/) for a secure connection to Tor.
Onion Browser and Orbot are open source, use Tor routing, and are developed by someone who works closely with the Tor Project.
However, Apple requires browsers on iOS to use something called Webkit, which prevents Onion Browser from having the same privacy protections as Tor Browser.

[Learn more about Onion Browser](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-browser-and-more-ios-tor).
Download [Onion Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) and [Orbot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orbot/id1609461599) from the App Store.

#### [Do I need both Tor Browser for Android and Orbot, or only one?](#tormobile_tormobile-6)

While both Tor Browser for Android and Orbot are great, they serve different purposes.
Tor Browser for Android is like the desktop Tor Browser, but on your mobile device. It is a one stop browser that uses the Tor network and tries to be as anonymous as possible.
Orbot on the other hand is a proxy that will enable you to send the data from your other applications (E-Mail clients, instant messaging apps, etc.) through the Tor network; a version of Orbot is also inside of Tor Browser for Android, and is what enables it to connect to the Tor network.
That version, however, does not enable you to send other apps outside of Tor Browser for Android through it.
Depending on how you want to use the Tor network, either one or both of these could be a great option.

#### [Can I run Tor Browser on an Android device?](#tormobile_tormobile-1)

Yes, there is a version of [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android) available specifically for Android. Installing Tor Browser for Android is all you need to run Tor on your Android device.

The Guardian Project provides the app [Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) which can be used to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network, however only Tor Browser for Android is needed to browse the web with Tor.

#### [Why Tor Browser for Android is being reported to have trackers?](#tormobile_tor-browser-reported-trackers)

The tracking code being reported is carried over from Firefox for Android as Tor Browser is based on Firefox.
[Exodus](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/org.torproject.torbrowser/latest/) and other analysis tools have conducted static analysis of this tracking code, which does not verify whether the tracking code is active or disabled.
All of the tracking code is [disabled](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/fenix/40009) in Tor Browser for Android.
Additionally, a complete removal of the tracking code is [planned](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/41180).

##### Connecting To Tor

#### [Tor Browser won't connect, but it doesn't seem to be an issue with censorship.](#connecting_connecting-1)

One of the most common issues that causes connection errors in Tor Browser is an incorrect system clock.
Please make sure your system clock and timezone are set accurately.
If this doesn't fix the problem, see the [Troubleshooting page on the Tor Browser manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/troubleshooting).

  [Permalink](connecting/connecting-1/)

#### [I am having trouble connecting to Tor, and I can't figure out what's wrong.](#connecting_connecting-2)

If you're having trouble connecting, an error message may appear and you can select the option to "copy Tor log to clipboard".
Then paste the Tor log into a text file or other document.

If you don't see this option and you have Tor Browser open, you can navigate to the [hamburger menu ("â¡")](glossary/hamburger-menu), then click on "Settings", and finally on "Connection" in the side bar.
At the bottom of the page, next to the "View the Tor logs" text, click the button "View Logs...".

Alternatively, on GNU/Linux, to view the logs right in the terminal, navigate to the Tor Browser directory and launch Tor Browser from the command line by running:

âª`./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose`

or to save the logs to a file *(default: tor-browser.log)*

âª`./start-tor-browser.desktop --log [file]`

You should see one of these common log errors (look for the following lines in your Tor log):

#### Common log error #1: Proxy connection failure

```
2017-10-29 09:23:40.800 [NOTICE] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9150
2017-10-29 09:23:47.900 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 5%: Connecting to directory server

2017-10-29 09:24:08.900 [WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to xx..xxx..xxx.xx:xxxxx ("general SOCKS server failure")

```

If you see lines like these in your Tor log, it means you are failing to connect to a SOCKS proxy.
If a SOCKS proxy is required for your network setup, then please make sure you've entered your proxy details correctly.
If a SOCKS proxy is not required, or you're not sure, please try connecting to the Tor network without a SOCKS proxy.

#### Common log error #2: Can't reach guard relays

```
11/1/2017 21:11:43 PM.500 [NOTICE] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9150
11/1/2017 21:11:44 PM.300 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 80%: Connecting to the Tor network

11/1/2017 21:11:44 PM.500 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 85%: Finishing handshake with first hop
11/1/2017 21:11:45 PM.300 [WARN] Failed to find node for hop 0 of our path. Discarding this circuit.

```

If you see lines like these in your Tor log, it means your Tor failed to connect to the first node in the Tor circuit.
This could mean that you're on a network that's censored.

Please try connecting with bridges, and that should fix the problem.

#### Common log error #3: Failed to complete TLS handshake

```
13-11-17 19:52:24.300 [NOTICE] Bootstrapped 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server
13-11-17 19:53:49.300 [WARN] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server. (DONE; DONE; count 10; recommendation warn; host [host] at xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:xxx)

13-11-17 19:53:49.300 [WARN]  1 connections died in state connect()ing with SSL state (No SSL object)

```

If you see lines like this in your Tor log, it means that Tor failed to complete a TLS handshake with the directory authorities.
Using bridges will likely fix this.

#### Common log error #4: Clock skew

```
19.11.2017 00:04:47.400 [NOTICE] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9150

```

If you see lines like this in your Tor log, it means your system clock is incorrect.
Please make sure your clock is set accurately, including the correct timezone. Then restart Tor.

#### ["Proxy server is refusing connection" error](#connecting_connecting-4)

Proxy server errors can occur for a variety of reasons.
You may try one or more of the following activities in case you encounter this error:

* If you have an antivirus, it may be interfering with the Tor service. Disable the antivirus and restart the browser.
* You should not move the Tor Browser folder from its original location to a different location.
  If you did this, revert the change.
* You should also check the port that you are connecting with. Try a different port from the one currently in use, such as 9050 or 9150.
* When all else fails, reinstall the browser. This time, make sure to install Tor Browser in a new directory, not over a previously installed browser.

If the error persists, please [get in touch](misc/bug-or-feedback/) with us.

#### [I cannot reach X.onion!](#connecting_connecting-3)

If you cannot reach the onion service you desire, make sure that you have entered the 56-character onion address correctly; even a small mistake will stop Tor Browser from being able to reach the site.
If you are still unable to connect to the onion service, please try again later.
There may be a temporary connection issue, or the site operators may have allowed it to go offline without warning.

You can also ensure that you're able to access other onion services by connecting to [DuckDuckGo's onion service](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/).

#### [I suspect I may be facing internet censorship. How can I verify this?](#censorship_how-to-check-if-tor-is-blocked-using-ooni)

If you suspect that your government or Internet Service Provider (ISP) has implemented some form of Internet censorship or filtering, you can test whether the Tor network is being blocked by using [OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/).
OONI Probe is a free and open source application developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI).
It is designed to test and measure which websites, messaging apps, and circumvention tools may be blocked.

Before you run these measurement tests, please carefully read OONI's security recommendations and [risk assessment](https://ooni.org/about/risks/).
As any other testing tool, please be aware of [false positive tests with OONI](https://ooni.org/support/glossary/#false-positive).

To check if Tor is blocked, you can [install OONI Probe](https://ooni.org/install/) on your mobile device or on your desktop, and run the ["Circumvention Test"](https://ooni.org/support/ooni-probe-mobile#measuring-the-blocking-of-circumvention-tools).
An OONI Tor Test can serve as an indication of a potential block of the Tor network, but a thorough analysis by our developers is crucial for a conclusive evaluation.

#### [Our website is blocked by a censor. Can Tor Browser help users access our website?](#censorship_censorship-1)

Tor Browser can certainly help people access your website in places where it is blocked.
Most of the time, simply downloading the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download) and then using it to navigate to the blocked site will allow access.
In places where there is heavy censorship we have a number of censorship circumvention options available, including [pluggable transports](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/transports/).

For more information, please see the [Tor Browser User Manual section on censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

#### [What is a bridge?](#censorship_censorship-7)

Bridge relays are Tor relays that are not listed in the public Tor directory.

That means that ISPs or governments trying to block access to the Tor network can't simply block all bridges.
Bridges are useful for Tor users under oppressive regimes, and for people who want an extra layer of security because they're worried somebody will recognize that they are contacting a public Tor relay IP address.

A bridge is just a normal relay with a slightly different configuration.
See [How do I run a bridge](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/) for instructions.

Several countries, including China and Iran, have found ways to detect and block connections to Tor bridges.
[Obfsproxy](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4/blob/master/doc/obfs4-spec.txt) bridges address this by adding another layer of obfuscation.
Setting up an obfsproxy bridge requires an additional software package and additional configurations.
See our page on [pluggable transports](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) for more info.

#### [What is Snowflake?](#censorship_what-is-snowflake)

Snowflake is a [pluggable transport](glossary/pluggable-transports/) available in Tor Browser to defeat internet censorship.
Like a Tor bridge, a user can access the open internet when even regular Tor connections are censored.
To use Snowflake is as easy as to switch to a new bridge configuration in Tor Browser.

This system is composed of three components: volunteers running Snowflake proxies, Tor users that want to connect to the internet, and a broker, that delivers snowflake proxies to users.

Volunteers willing to help users on censored networks can help by spinning short-lived proxies on their regular browsers. Check, [how can I use Snowflake?](censorship/how-can-i-use-snowflake/)

Snowflake uses the highly effective [domain fronting](glossary/domain-fronting/) technique to make a connection to one of the thousands of snowflake proxies run by volunteers.
These proxies are lightweight, ephemeral, and easy to run, allowing us to scale Snowflake more easily than previous techniques.

For censored users, if your Snowflake proxy gets blocked, the broker will find a new proxy for you, automatically.

If you're interested in the technical details and specification, see the [Snowflake Technical Overview](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/Technical%20Overview) and the [project page](https://snowflake.torproject.org/).
For other discussions about Snowflake, please visit the [Tor Forum](https://forum.torproject.org) and follow up the [Snowflake tag](https://forum.torproject.org/tag/snowflake).

#### [How can I use Snowflake?](#censorship_how-can-i-use-snowflake)

Snowflake is available in [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) stable for all platforms: Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, and Android.
You can also use Snowflake with [Onion Browser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448) on iOS.

If you're running Tor Browser for desktop for the first time, you can click on 'Configure Connection' on the start-up screen.
Under the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on "Select a Built-In Bridge" option.
From the menu, select 'Snowflake'.
Once you've selected Snowflake, scroll up and click 'Connect' to save your settings.

From within the browser, you can click on the [hamburger menu ("â¡")](glossary/hamburger-menu/), then go to 'Settings' and go to 'Connection'.
Alternatively, you can also type `about:preferences#connection` in the URL bar.
Under the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on "Select a Built-In Bridge" option.

#### [How to help running Snowflake proxies?](#censorship_how-to-help-running-snowflake)

If your internet access is not censored, you should consider installing the Snowflake extension to help users in censored networks.
When you run Snowflake on your regular browser, you will proxy traffic between censored users and an entry node in the Tor network, and that's all.

Due to censorship of VPN servers in some countries, we kindly ask you to not run a snowflake proxy while connected to a VPN.

#### Add-on

Firstly make sure you have WebRTC enabled.
Then you can install this [extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/torproject-snowflake/) or the [extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie) which will let you become a Snowflake proxy.
It can also inform you about how many people you have helped in the last 24 hours.

#### Web page

In a browser where WebRTC is enabled:
If you don't want to add Snowflake to your browser, you can go to <https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed> and toggle the button to opt in to being a proxy.
You shouldn't close that page if you want to remain a Snowflake proxy.

#### [Tor Browser can't connect. Is my network censored?](#censorship_censorship-4)

If you have exhausted general [troubleshooting](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/troubleshooting/) steps, it's possible that your connection to Tor is censored.
In that case, connecting with one of the [built-in censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) methods in Tor Browser can help.
[Connection Assist](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/) can automatically choose one for you using your location.

If Connection Assist is unable to facilitate the connection to Tor, you can configure Tor Browser to use one of the built-in circumvention methods manually.
To use bridges and access other censorship circumvention related settings, click "Configure Connection" when starting Tor Browser for the first time.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
From the menu, select a [censorship circumvention method](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

Or, if you have Tor Browser running, click on "Settings" in the hamburger menu (â¡) and then on "Connection" in the sidebar.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
Select a censorship circumvention method from the menu.

#### [How to circumvent the Great Firewall and connect to Tor from China?](#censorship_connecting-from-china)

Users in China need to take a few steps to circumvent the [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) and connect to the Tor network.

To get an updated version of Tor Browser, try the Telegram bot first: [@gettor\_bot](https://t.me/gettor_bot).
If that doesn't work, you can send an email to gettor@torproject.org with the subject "windows", "macos", or "linux" for the respective operating system.

After the installation, Tor Browser will try to connect to the Tor network.
If Tor is blocked in your location, Connection Assist will try to automatically connect using a bridge or Snowflake.
But if that doesn't work, the second step will be to obtain a bridge that works in China.

There are three options to unblock Tor in China:

1. **[Snowflake](censorship/what-is-snowflake/):** uses ephemeral proxies to connect to the Tor network.
   It's available in Tor Browser and other Tor powered apps like Orbot.
   You can select Snowflake from Tor Browser's [built-in bridge menu](censorship/how-can-i-use-snowflake/).
2. **Private and unlisted obfs4 bridges:** contact our Telegram Bot [@GetBridgesBot](https://t.me/GetBridgesBot) and type `/bridges`.
   Or send an email to frontdesk@torproject.org with the phrase "private bridge cn" in the subject of the email.
   If you are tech-savvy, you can run your own [obfs4 bridge](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/) from outside China.
   Remember that bridges distributed by [BridgeDB](https://bridges.torproject.org), and built-in obfs4 bridges bundled in Tor Browser most likely won't work.
3. **meek-azure:** makes it look like you are browsing a Microsoft website instead of using Tor.
   However, because it has a bandwidth limitation, this option will be quite slow.
   You can select meek-azure from Tor Browser's built-in bridges dropdown.

If one of these options above is not working, check your [Tor logs](connecting/connecting-2/) and try another option.

If you need help, you can contact our support team on Telegram [Tor Project Support](https://t.me/TorProjectSupportBot) and [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+17787431312).

#### [A website I am trying to reach is blocking access over Tor.](#censorship_censorship-2)

Sometimes websites will block Tor users because they can't tell the difference between the average Tor user and automated traffic.
The best success we've had in getting sites to unblock Tor users is getting users to contact the site administrators directly.
Something like this might do the trick:

"Hi! I tried to access your site xyz.com while using Tor Browser and discovered that you don't allow Tor users to access your site.
I urge you to reconsider this decision; Tor is used by people all over the world to protect their privacy and fight censorship.
By blocking Tor users, you are likely blocking people in repressive countries who want to use a free internet, journalists and researchers who want to protect themselves from discovery, whistleblowers, activists, and ordinary people who want to opt out of invasive third party tracking.
Please take a strong stance in favor of digital privacy and internet freedom, and allow Tor users access to xyz.com. Thank you."

In the case of banks, and other sensitive websites, it is also common to see geography-based blocking (if a bank knows you generally access their services from one country, and suddenly you are connecting from an exit relay on the other side of the world, your account may be locked or suspended).

If you are unable to connect to an onion service, please see [I cannot reach X.onion!](onionservices/onionservices-3).

##### HTTPS

#### [When I'm using Tor, can eavesdroppers still see the information I share with websites, like login information and things I type into forms?](#https_https-1)

Tor prevents eavesdroppers from learning sites that you visit.
However, information sent unencrypted over the internet using plain HTTP can still be intercepted by exit relay operators or anyone observing the traffic between your exit relay and your destination website.
If the site you are visiting uses HTTPS, then the traffic leaving your exit relay will be encrypted, and won't be visible to eavesdroppers.

The following visualization shows what information is visible to eavesdroppers with and without Tor Browser and HTTPS encryption:

* Click the âTorâ button to see what data is visible to observers when you're using Tor. The button will turn green to indicate that Tor is on.
* Click the âHTTPSâ button to see what data is visible to observers when you're using HTTPS. The button will turn green to indicate that HTTPS is on.
* When both buttons are green, you see the data that is visible to observers when you are using both tools.
* When both buttons are grey, you see the data that is visible to observers when you don't use either tool.

##### Relay Operators

#### [What is the BadExit flag?](#relay-operators_what-is-the-bad-exit-flag)

When an exit is misconfigured or malicious it's assigned the BadExit flag. This tells Tor to avoid exiting through that relay. In effect, relays with this flag become non-exits.
If you got this flag then we either discovered a problem or suspicious activity when routing traffic through your exit and weren't able to contact you. Please reach out to the [bad-relays team](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/bad-relays/) so we can sort out the issue.

#### [Do I get better anonymity if I run a relay?](#relay-operators_better-anonymity)

Yes, you do get better anonymity against some attacks.

The simplest example is an attacker who owns a small number of Tor relays.
They will see a connection from you, but they won't be able to know whether the connection originated at your computer or was relayed from somebody else.

There are some cases where it doesn't seem to help: if an attacker can watch all of your incoming and outgoing traffic, then it's easy for them to learn which connections were relayed and which started at you.
(In this case they still don't know your destinations unless they are watching them too, but you're no better off than if you were an ordinary client.)

There are also some downsides to running a Tor relay.
First, while we only have a few hundred relays, the fact that you're running one might signal to an attacker that you place a high value on your anonymity.
Second, there are some more esoteric attacks that are not as well-understood or well-tested that involve making use of the knowledge that you're running a relay -- for example, an attacker may be able to "observe" whether you're sending traffic even if they can't actually watch your network, by relaying traffic through your Tor relay and noticing changes in traffic timing.

It is an open research question whether the benefits outweigh the risks.
A lot of that depends on the attacks you are most worried about.
For most users, we think it's a smart move.

#### [How can I limit the total amount of bandwidth used by my Tor relay?](#relay-operators_limit-total-bandwidth)

The accounting options in the torrc file allow you to specify the maximum amount of bytes your relay uses for a time period.

```
    AccountingStart day week month [day] HH:MM

```

This specifies when the accounting should reset. For instance, to setup a total amount of bytes served for a week (that resets every Wednesday at 10:00am), you would use:

```
    AccountingStart week 3 10:00
    AccountingMax 500 GBytes

```

This specifies the maximum amount of data your relay will send during an accounting period, and the maximum amount of data your relay will receive during an accounting period.
When the accounting period resets (from AccountingStart), then the counters for AccountingMax are reset to 0.

Example: Let's say you want to allow 50 GB of traffic every day in each direction and the accounting should reset at noon each day:

```
    AccountingStart day 12:00
    AccountingMax 50 GBytes

```

Note that your relay won't wake up exactly at the beginning of each accounting period.
It will keep track of how quickly it used its quota in the last period, and choose a random point in the new interval to wake up.
This way we avoid having hundreds of relays working at the beginning of each month but none still up by the end.

If you have only a small amount of bandwidth to donate compared to your connection speed, we recommend you use daily accounting, so you don't end up using your entire monthly quota in the first day.
Just divide your monthly amount by 30. You might also consider rate limiting to spread your usefulness over more of the day: if you want to offer X GB in each direction, you could set your RelayBandwidthRate to 20\*X KBytes.
For example, if you have 50 GB to offer each way, you might set your RelayBandwidthRate to 1000 KBytes: this way your relay will always be useful for at least half of each day.

```
    AccountingStart day 0:00
    AccountingMax 50 GBytes
    RelayBandwidthRate 1000 KBytes
    RelayBandwidthBurst 5000 KBytes # allow higher bursts but maintain average

```

#### [How stable does my relay need to be?](#relay-operators_relay-flexible)

We aim to make setting up a Tor relay easy and convenient:

* It's fine if the relay goes offline sometimes.
  The directories notice this quickly and stop advertising the relay.
  Just try to make sure it's not too often, since connections using the relay when it disconnects will break.
* Each Tor relay has an [exit policy](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ExitPolicies) that specifies what sort of outbound connections are allowed or refused from that relay.
  If you are uncomfortable allowing people to exit from your relay, you can set it up to only allow connections to other Tor relays.
* Your relay will passively estimate and advertise its recent bandwidth capacity, so high-bandwidth relays will attract more users than low-bandwidth ones. Therefore, having low-bandwidth relays is useful too.

#### [How do I change my bridge distribution method?](#relay-operators_change-bridge-distribution)

BridgeDB implements [six mechanisms](https://bridges.torproject.org/info) to distribute bridges: HTTPS, Moat, Email, Telegram, Settings and Reserved.
Bridge operators can check which mechanism their bridge is using, on the [Relay Search](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search).
Enter the bridge's `<HASHED FINGERPRINT>` in the form and click "Search".

Operators can also choose which distribution method their bridge uses.
To change the method, modify the `BridgeDistribution` setting in the torrc file to one of these: https, moat, email, telegram, settings, lox, none, any.
You can find a description of each distributor in the [rdsys distributors documentation](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/rdsys/-/blob/main/doc/distributors.md).

#### [Should I run an exit relay from home?](#relay-operators_operators-7)

No.
If law enforcement becomes interested in traffic from your exit relay, it's possible that officers will seize your computer.
For that reason, it's best not to run your exit relay in your home or using your home internet connection.

Instead, consider running your exit relay in a commercial facility that is supportive of Tor.
Have a separate IP address for your exit relay, and don't route your own traffic through it.
Of course, you should avoid keeping any sensitive or personal information on the computer hosting your exit relay.

#### [What bandwidth shaping options are available to Tor relays?](#relay-operators_bandwidth-shaping)

There are two options you can add to your torrc file:

**BandwidthRate** is the maximum long-term bandwidth allowed (bytes per second).
For example, you might want to choose "BandwidthRate 10 MBytes" for 10 megabytes per second (a fast connection), or "BandwidthRate 500 KBytes" for 500 kilobytes per second (a decent cable connection).
The minimum BandwidthRate setting is 75 kilobytes per second.

**BandwidthBurst** is a pool of bytes used to fulfill requests during short periods of traffic above BandwidthRate but still keeps the average over a long period to BandwidthRate.
A low Rate but a high Burst enforces a long-term average while still allowing more traffic during peak times if the average hasn't been reached lately.
For example, if you choose "BandwidthBurst 500 KBytes" and also use that for your BandwidthRate, then you will never use more than 500 kilobytes per second; but if you choose a higher BandwidthBurst (like 5 MBytes), it will allow more bytes through until the pool is empty.

If you have an asymmetric connection (upload less than download) such as a cable modem, you should set BandwidthRate to less than your smaller bandwidth (Usually that's the upload bandwidth).
Otherwise, you could drop many packets during periods of maximum bandwidth usage - you may need to experiment with which values make your connection comfortable.
Then set BandwidthBurst to the same as BandwidthRate.

Linux-based Tor nodes have another option at their disposal: they can prioritize Tor traffic below other traffic on their machine, so that their own personal traffic is not impacted by Tor load.
A [script to do this](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/contrib/operator-tools/linux-tor-prio.sh?h=maint-0.3.5) can be found in the Tor source distribution's contrib directory.

Additionally, there are hibernation options where you can tell Tor to only serve a certain amount of bandwidth per time period (such as 100 GB per month). These are covered in the [hibernation entry](relay-operators/limit-total-bandwidth/).

Note that BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst are in **Bytes**, not Bits.

#### [My relay is slow, how can I fix it?](#relay-operators_why-is-my-relay-slow)

### Why Relay Load Varies

Tor manages bandwidth across the entire network. It does a reasonable job for most relays.
But Tor's goals are different to protocols like BitTorrent.
Tor wants low-latency web pages, which requires fast connections with headroom.
BitTorrent wants bulk downloads, which requires using all the bandwidth.

We're working on a [new bandwidth scanner](https://sbws.readthedocs.io/), which is easier to understand and maintain.
It will have diagnostics for relays that don't get measured, and relays that have low measurements.

### Why does Tor need bandwidth scanners?

Most providers tell you the maximum speed of your local connection.
But Tor has users all over the world, and our users connect to one or two Guard relays at random.
So we need to know how well each relay can connect to the entire world.

So even if all relay operators set their advertised bandwidth to their local connection speed, we would still need bandwidth authorities to balance the load between different parts of the Internet.

### What is a normal relay load?

It's normal for most relays to be loaded at 30%-80% of their capacity.
This is good for clients: an overloaded relay has high latency.
(We want enough relays to so that each relay is loaded at 10%. Then Tor would be almost as fast as the wider Internet).

Sometimes, a relay is slow because its processor is slow or its connections are limited.
Other times, it is the network that is slow: the relay has bad peering to most other tor relays, or is a long distance away.

### Finding Out what is Limiting a Relay

Lots of things can slow down a relay. Here's how to track them down.

#### System Limits

* Check RAM, CPU, and socket/file descriptor usage on your relay

Tor logs some of these when it starts. Others can be viewed using top or similar tools.

#### Provider Limits

* Check the Internet peering (bandwidth, latency) from your relay's provider to other relays.
  Relays transiting via Comcast have been slow at times.
  Relays outside North America and Western Europe are usually slower.

#### Tor Network Limits

Relay bandwidth can be limited by a relay's own observed bandwidth, or by the directory authorities' measured bandwidth.
Here's how to find out which measurement is limiting your relay:

* Check each of the votes for your relay on [consensus-health (large page)](https://consensus-health.torproject.org/consensus-health.html), and check the median.
  If your relay is not marked Running by some directory authorities:
  + Does it have the wrong IPv4 or IPv6 address?
  + Is its IPv4 or IPv6 address unreachable from some networks?
  + Are there more than 2 relays on its IPv4 address?

Otherwise, check your relay's observed bandwidth and bandwidth rate (limit).
Look up your relay on [Metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search).
Then mouse over the bandwidth heading to see the observed bandwidth and relay bandwidth rate.

Here is some more detail and some examples: [Drop in consensus weight](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2016-November/010913.html) and [Rampup speed of Exit relay](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2016-October/010784.html).

#### How to fix it

The smallest of these figures is limiting the bandwidth allocated to the relay.

* If it's the bandwidth rate, increase the BandwidthRate/Burst or RelayBandwidthRate/Burst in your torrc.
* If it's the observed bandwidth, your relay won't ask for more bandwidth until it sees itself getting faster.
  You need to work out why it is slow.
* If it's the median measured bandwidth, your relay looks slow from a majority of bandwidth authorities.
  You need to work out why they measure it slow.

### Doing Your Own Relay Measurements

If your relay thinks it is slow, or the bandwidth authorities think it is slow, you can test the bandwidth yourself:

* Run a test using tor to see how fast tor can get on your network

  For this, you need to configure a tor client to use use your relay as entry.
  If your relay has only `Guard` flag, set `EntryNodes` with your relay fingerprint in `torrc`.
  If your relay doesn't have `Guard` flag or it has `Guard` and `Exit` flags, you can't set your relay as an entry node (see <https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/22204>), but you can set it as your bridge, even if it is not a bridge.
  To set your relay as a bridge, add to your `torrc`:

  ```
  Bridge <ip>:<port>
  UseBridge 1

  ```

  Then download a large file using your `SocksPort` as a socks proxy.
  For this, you can use `curl`, eg:

  ```
  curl https://target/path --proxy socks5h://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1:<socks-port>

  ```

  Using different `user`/`password` guarantees different circuits. You can use `$RANDOM`.

  That will give you some idea of how much traffic your relay can sustain.

  Alternatively, you can run [relay\_bw](https://gitlab.torproject.org/juga/relay_bw) to test your relay using 2 hops circuits, in a similar way as [sbws](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/network-health/sbws/) does.
* Run a test using tor and [chutney](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/chutney/-/blob/c4f6789ad2558dcbfeb7d024c6481d8112bfb6c2/README.md#L143) to find out how fast tor can get on your CPU.
  Keep increasing the data volume until the bandwidth stops increasing.

#### [My relay is picking the wrong IP address.](#relay-operators_wrong-ip)

Tor guesses its IP address by asking the computer for its hostname, and then resolving that hostname. Often people have old entries in their /etc/hosts file that point to old IP addresses.

If that doesn't fix it, you should use the "Address" config option to specify the IP address you want it to pick. If your computer is behind a NAT and it only has an internal IP address, see the following Support entry on dynamic IP addresses.

Also, if you have many addresses, you might also want to set "OutboundBindAddress" so external connections come from the IP you intend to present to the world.

#### [How do offline ed25519 identity keys work? What do I need to know?](#relay-operators_offline-ed25519)

In simple words, it works like this:

* There is a primary ed25519 identity secret key file named "ed25519\_master\_id\_secret\_key".
  This is the most important one, so make sure you keep a backup in a secure place - the file is sensitive and should be protected.
  Tor could encrypt it for you if you generate it manually and enter a password when asked.
* A medium term signing key named "ed25519\_signing\_secret\_key" is generated for Tor to use.
  Also, a certificate is generated named "ed25519\_signing\_cert" which is signed by the primary identity secret key and confirms that the medium term signing key is valid for a certain period of time.
  The default validity is 30 days, but this can be customized by setting "SigningKeyLifetime N days|weeks|months" in torrc.
* There is also a primary public key named "ed25519\_master\_id\_public\_key", which is the actual identity of the relay advertised in the network.
  This one is not sensitive and can be easily computed from "ed5519\_master\_id\_secret\_key".

Tor will only need access to the medium term signing key and certificate as long as they are valid, so the primary identity secret key can be kept outside DataDirectory/keys, on a storage media or a different computer.
You'll have to manually renew the medium term signing key and certificate before they expire otherwise the Tor process on the relay will exit upon expiration.

This feature is optional, you don't need to use it unless you want to.
If you want your relay to run unattended for longer time without having to manually do the medium term signing key renewal on regular basis, best to leave the primary identity secret key in DataDirectory/keys, just make a backup in case you'll need to reinstall it.
If you want to use this feature, you can consult our more [detailed guide](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorRelaySecurity/OfflineKeys) on the topic.

#### [How should I configure the outgoing filters on my relay?](#relay-operators_outgoing-firewall)

All outgoing connections must be allowed, so that each relay can communicate with every other relay.

In many jurisdictions, Tor relay operators are legally protected by the same common carrier regulations that prevent internet service providers from being held liable for third-party content that passes through their network.
Exit relays that filter some traffic would likely forfeit those protections.

Tor promotes free network access without interference.
Exit relays must not filter the traffic that passes through them to the internet.
Exit relays found to be filtering traffic will get the [BadExit](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/bad-relays/) flag once detected.

#### [What type of relays are most needed?](#relay-operators_what-type-of-relays-are-most-needed)

* The exit relay is the most needed relay type but it also comes with the highest legal exposure and risk (and **you should NOT run them from your home**).
* If you are looking to run a relay with minimal effort, fast guard relays are also very useful
* Followed by bridges.

#### [I want to run more than one Tor relay.](#relay-operators_multiple-relays)

Great. If you want to run several relays to donate more to the network, we're happy with that.
But please don't run more than a few dozen on the same network, since part of the goal of the Tor network is dispersal and diversity.

If you do decide to run more than one relay, please set the "MyFamily" config option in the torrc of each relay, listing all the relays (comma-separated) that are under your control:

```
MyFamily $fingerprint1,$fingerprint2,$fingerprint3

```

where each fingerprint is the 40 character identity fingerprint (without spaces).

That way, Tor clients will know to avoid using more than one of your relays in a single circuit.
You should set MyFamily if you have administrative control of the computers or of their network, even if they're not all in the same geographic location.

#### [Can I run a Tor relay using a dynamic IP address?](#relay-operators_dynamic-ip)

Tor can handle relays with dynamic IP addresses just fine.
Just leave the "Address" line in your [torrc](tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/) blank, and Tor will guess.

#### [Why does my relay write more bytes onto the network than it reads?](#relay-operators_relay-write-more-bytes)

You're right, for the most part a byte into your Tor relay means a byte out, and vice versa. But there are a few exceptions:

If you open your DirPort, then Tor clients will ask you for a copy of the directory.
The request they make (an HTTP GET) is quite small, and the response is sometimes quite large.
This probably accounts for most of the difference between your "write" byte count and your "read" byte count.

Another minor exception shows up when you operate as an exit node, and you read a few bytes from an exit connection (for example, an instant messaging or ssh connection) and wrap it up into an entire 512 byte cell for transport through the Tor network.

#### [Should I install Tor from my package manager, or build from source?](#relay-operators_packaged-tor)

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu especially, please use the [Tor Project's repository](apt/tor-deb-repo/), so you can easily receive updates.
In addition, using the package provides other conveniences:

* Your `ulimit -n` gets set to a high number, so Tor can keep open all the connections it needs.
* The package creates and uses a separate user, so you don't need to run Tor as your own user.
* The package includes an init script so Tor runs at boot.
* Tor can bind to low-numbered ports, then drop privileges.

#### [My relay or bridge is overloaded what does this mean?](#relay-operators_relay-bridge-overloaded)

On relay search we show an amber dot next to the relay nickname when it is overloaded.
This means that one or many of the following load metrics have been triggered:

* [Any Tor OOM invocation due to memory pressure](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#tor-relay-load-oom-bytes-total..})
* [Any ntor onionskins are dropped](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#tor-relay-load-onionskins-total-type-ntor-action-dropped-0)
* [TCP port exhaustion](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#tcp-port-exhaustion)

Note that if a relay reaches an overloaded state we show it for 72 hours after the relay has recovered.

If you notice that your relay is overloaded please:

1. Check <https://status.torproject.org/> for any known issues in the "Tor network" category.
2. Consider [tuning `sysctl` for your system](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#tuning-sysctl-for-network-memory-and-cpu-load) for network, memory and CPU load.
3. Consider [enabling `MetricsPort`](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#metricsport) to understand what is happening.

## Tuning `sysctl` for network, memory and CPU load

### TCP port exhaustion

If you are experiencing TCP port exhaustion consider expanding your local port range.
You can do that with

`# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="15000 64000"`

or

`# echo 15000 64000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`

Keep in mind that tuning `sysctl` as described is not permanent and will be lost upon restart.
You need to add the configuration to `/etc/sysctl.conf` or to a file in `/etc/sysctl.d/` to make it permanent.

## MetricsPort

To understand the well-being of Tor relays and the Tor network it is vital to provide and have access to relay metrics.
Relay overload information has been added to relay descriptors since 0.4.6+ but it was not until Tor >= 0.4.7.1-alpha that an interface to the underlying relay metrics was available: the metrics port.

### Enabling MetricsPort

Tor provides access to the metrics port via a torrc configuration option called `MetricsPort`.

It's important to understand that **exposing the tor MetricsPort publicly is dangerous for the Tor network users**, which is why that port is not enabled by default and its access has to be governed by an access policy.
Please take extra precaution and care when opening this port, and close it when you are done debugging.

Let's assume you are the only user on a server that runs a Tor relay.
You can enable the metrics port adding this to your torrc file:

```
MetricsPort 127.0.0.1:9035
MetricsPortPolicy accept 127.0.0.1

```

And then you will be able to easily retrieve the metrics with:

`# curl http://127.0.0.1:9035/metrics`

which are by default in a Prometheus format.

**Note:** every user on that server will be able to access those relay metrics in the example above.
In general, set a very strict access policy with `MetricsPortPolicy` and consider using your operating systems firewall features for defense in depth.

For a more detailed explanation about `MetricsPort` and `MetricsPortPolicy` see tor's man page.

### MetricsPort output

Here is an example of what output enabling `MetricsPort` will produce (we omitted any congestion control related metrics as we still need to stabilize that interface):

```

Let's find out what some of these lines actually mean:

### tor\_relay\_load\_onionskins\_total{type="ntor",action="dropped"} 0

When a relay starts seeing "dropped", it is a CPU/RAM problem usually.

Tor is sadly single threaded *except* for when the "onion skins" are processed.
The "onion skins" are the cryptographic work that needs to be done on the famous "onion layers" in every circuits.

When tor processes the layers we use a thread pool and outsource all of that work to that pool.
It can happen that this pool starts dropping work due to memory or CPU pressure and this will trigger an overload state.

If your server is running at capacity this will likely be triggered.

### tor\_relay\_exit\_dns\_error\_total{...}

Any counter in the "\*\_dns\_error\_total" realm (apart from the one for successful queries) indicates a potential DNS related problem.
However, we realized during the 0.4.7 release cycle that DNS errors are way too noisy and contain too many false positives to be useful for overload reporting purposes.
We therefore don't use them anymore for that purpose starting with 0.4.6.9 and 0.4.7.4-alpha. However, we still keep DNS metrics around to give the relay operator insight into what is going on with their relay.

DNS timeout issues and errors only apply to Exit nodes.

### tor\_relay\_load\_oom\_bytes\_total{...}

An Out-Of-Memory invocation indicates a RAM problem.
The relay might need more RAM or it is leaking memory.
If you noticed that the tor process is leaking memory, please report the issue either via [Tor gitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org) or sending an email to the [tor-relays mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays).

Tor has its own OOM handler and it is invoked when 75%, of the total memory tor thinks is available, is reached.
Thus, let's say tor thinks it can use 2GB in total then at 1.5GB of memory usage, it will start freeing memory.
That is considered an overload state.

To estimate the amount of memory it has available, when tor starts, it will use `MaxMemInQueues` or, if not set, will look at the total RAM available on the system and apply this algorithm:

```
    if RAM >= 8GB {
      memory = RAM * 40%
    } else {
      memory = RAM * 75%
    }
    /* Capped. */
    memory = min(memory, 8GB) -> [8GB on 64bit and 2GB on 32bit)
    /* Minimum value. */
    memory = max(250MB, memory)

```

To avoid an overloaded state we recommend to run a relay above 2GB of RAM on 64bit.
4GB is advised, although of course it doesn't hurt to add more RAM if you can.
**Note:** If you are running a powerful server with lots of RAM then you might end up in an overloaded state due to the default queue size limit of 8GB even though you still have plenty of RAM unused. Add an appropriate `MaxMemInQueues` entry to your `torrc` configuration in that case.

One might notice that tor could be called by the OS OOM handler itself.
Because tor takes the total memory on the system when it starts, if the overall system has many other applications running using RAM, it ends up eating too much memory.
In this case the OS could OOM tor, without tor even noticing memory pressure.

### tor\_relay\_load\_socket\_total

If the number of opened sockets is close to or the same as total sockets available then this indicates the relay is running out of sockets.
The solution is to increase `ulimit -n` for the tor process.

### tor\_relay\_load\_tcp\_exhaustion\_total

These lines indicate the relay is running out of TCP ports.

Try to tune `sysctl` as [described above](relay-operators/relay-bridge-overloaded/#tcp-port-exhaustion).

### tor\_relay\_load\_global\_rate\_limit\_reached\_total

If this counter is incremented by some noticeable value over a short period of time, the relay is congested.
It is likely being used as a Guard by a big onion service or for an ongoing DDoS on the network.

If your relay is still overloaded and you don't know why, please get in touch with network-report@torproject.org.

#### [How do I make sure that I'm using the correct packages on Ubuntu?](#relay-operators_operators-4)

* Do not use the packages in Ubuntu's repositories. They are not reliably updated. If you use them, you will miss important stability and security fixes.
* Determine your Ubuntu version by running the following command:
  ```
   âª$ lsb_release -c

  ```
* As root, add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list. Replace 'version' with the version you found in the previous step:
  ```
   deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org version main
   deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org version main

  ```
* Add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands:
  ```
   âª$ curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | sudo apt-key add -

#### [I want to upgrade/move my relay. How do I keep the same identity?](#relay-operators_upgrade-or-move)

When upgrading your Tor relay, or moving it to a different computer, be sure to keep the same identity keys (stored in `keys/ed25519_master_id_secret_key` and `keys/secret_id_key` in your DataDirectory).

If you are a bridge operator, also make sure to keep `pt_state/`. It contains data required for your bridge to keep working with the same bridge line.

For simplicity, just copying over the entire DataDirectory should work too.

You may wish to keep backups of these identity keys, plus pt\_state for a bridge, so you can restore the relay if something goes wrong.

#### [Can I use IPv6 on my relay?](#relay-operators_ipv6-relay)

Tor [has partial support for IPv6](https://blog.torproject.org/state-of-ipv6-support-tor-network) and we encourage every relay operator to [enable IPv6 functionality](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/post-install/) in their [torrc](tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/) configuration files when IPv6 connectivity is available.
For the time being Tor will require IPv4 addresses on relays, you can not run a Tor relay on a host with IPv6 addresses only.

#### [Why is my Tor relay using so much memory?](#relay-operators_relay-memory)

If your Tor relay is using more memory than you'd like, here are some tips for reducing its footprint:

* If you're on Linux, you may be encountering memory fragmentation bugs in glibc's malloc implementation.
  That is, when Tor releases memory back to the system, the pieces of memory are fragmented so they're hard to reuse.
  The Tor tarball ships with OpenBSD's malloc implementation, which doesn't have as many fragmentation bugs (but the tradeoff is higher CPU load).
  You can tell Tor to use this malloc implementation instead: `./configure --enable-openbsd-malloc`.
* If you're running a fast relay, meaning you have many TLS connections open, you are probably losing a lot of memory to OpenSSL's internal buffers (38KB+ per socket).
  We've patched OpenSSL to [release unused buffer memory more aggressively](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2008-June/001519.html).
  If you update to OpenSSL 1.0.0 or newer, Tor's build process will automatically recognize and use this feature.
* If you still can't handle the memory load, consider reducing the amount of bandwidth your relay advertises.
  Advertising less bandwidth means you will attract fewer users, so your relay shouldn't grow as large.
  See the `MaxAdvertisedBandwidth` option in the man page.

All of this said, fast Tor relays do use a lot of ram. It is not unusual for a fast exit relay to use 500-1000 MB of memory.

#### [Why isn't my relay being used more?](#relay-operators_why-isnt-my-relay-being-used-more)

If your relay is relatively new then give it time.
Tor decides which relays it uses heuristically based on reports from Bandwidth Authorities. These authorities take measurements of your relay's capacity and, over time, directs more traffic there until it reaches an optimal load.
The lifecycle of a new relay is explained in more depth in [this blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay).
If you've been running a relay for a while and still having issues then try asking on the [tor-relays list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays/).

#### [Why can I not browse anymore after limiting bandwidth on my Tor relay?](#relay-operators_hibernation)

The parameters assigned in the [AccountingMax](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#LimitTotalBandwidth) and [BandwidthRate](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#BandwidthShaping) apply to both client and relay functions of the Tor process.
Thus you may find that you are unable to browse as soon as your Tor goes into hibernation, signaled by this entry in the log:

```
Bandwidth soft limit reached; commencing hibernation.
No new connections will be accepted

```

The solution is to run two Tor processes - one relay and one client, each with its own config.
One way to do this (if you are starting from a working relay setup) is as follows:

* In the relay Tor torrc file, simply set the SocksPort to 0.
* Create a new client torrc file from the torrc.sample and ensure it uses a different log file from the relay.
  One naming convention may be torrc.client and torrc.relay.
* Modify the Tor client and relay startup scripts to include `-f /path/to/correct/torrc`.
* In Linux/BSD/Mac OS X, changing the startup scripts to `Tor.client` and `Tor.relay` may make separation of configs easier.

#### [Why do I get portscanned more often when I run a Tor relay?](#relay-operators_why-i-get-portscanned-more-often)

If you allow exit connections, some services that people connect to from your relay will connect back to collect more information about you. For example, some IRC servers connect back to your identd port to record which user made the connection. (This doesn't really work for them, because Tor doesn't know this information, but they try anyway.) Also, users exiting from you might attract the attention of other users on the IRC server, website, etc. who want to know more about the host they're relaying through.

Another reason is that groups who scan for open proxies on the Internet have learned that sometimes Tor relays expose their socks port to the world. We recommend that you bind your socksport to local networks only.

In any case, you need to keep up to date with your security. See this article on [security for Tor relays](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide/Security) for more suggestions.

#### [I'm behind a NAT/Firewall.](#relay-operators_behind-nat)

See [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/) for directions on how to port forward with your NAT/router device.

If your relay is running on a internal net, you need to setup port forwarding.
Forwarding TCP connections is system dependent but the [firewalled-clients FAQ](tbb/tbb-firewall-ports/) entry offers some examples on how to do this.

Also, here's an example of how you would do this on GNU/Linux if you're using iptables:

`/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --destination-port 9001 -j ACCEPT`

You may have to change "eth0" if you have a different external interface (the one connected to the Internet).
Chances are you have only one (except the loopback) so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.

#### [I'd run a relay, but I don't want to deal with abuse issues.](#relay-operators_exit-policies)

Great. That's exactly why we implemented exit policies.

Each Tor relay has an exit policy that specifies what sort of outbound connections are allowed or refused from that relay.
The exit policies are propagated to Tor clients via the directory, so clients will automatically avoid picking exit relays that would refuse to exit to their intended destination.
This way each relay can decide the services, hosts, and networks it wants to allow connections to, based on abuse potential and its own situation.
Read the [Support entry on issues you might encounter](abuse/exit-relay-expectations/) if you use the default exit policy, and then read Mike Perry's [tips for running an exit node with minimal harassment](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node).

The default exit policy allows access to many popular services (e.g. web browsing), but restricts some due to abuse potential (e.g. mail) and some since the Tor network can't handle the load (e.g. default file-sharing ports).
You can change your exit policy by editing your torrc file.
If you want to avoid most if not all abuse potential, set it to "reject \*:\*".
This setting means that your relay will be used for relaying traffic inside the Tor network, but not for connections to external websites or other services.

If you do allow any exit connections, make sure name resolution works (that is, your computer can resolve Internet addresses correctly).
If there are any resources that your computer can't reach (for example, you are behind a restrictive firewall or content filter), please explicitly reject them in your exit policy otherwise Tor users will be impacted too.

##### Onion Services

#### [What is a .onion or what are onion services?](#onionservices_onionservices-2)

Onion services allow people to browse but also to publish anonymously, including publishing anonymous websites.

Onion services are also relied on for metadata-free chat and file sharing, safer interaction between journalists and their sources like with [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) or [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/), safer software updates, and more secure ways to reach popular websites like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/making-connections-to-facebook-more-secure/1526085754298237/).

These services use the special-use top level domain (TLD) .onion (instead of .com, .net, .org, etc.) and are only accessible through the Tor network.

![Onion icon](static/images/onion-website.png)

When accessing a website that uses an onion service, Tor Browser will show at the URL bar an icon of an onion displaying the state of your connection: secure and using an onion service.

#### [V2 Onion Services Deprecation](#onionservices_v2-deprecation)

### How do I know if I'm using v2 or v3 onion services?

You can identify v3 onion addresses by their 56 character length, e.g. Tor Project's v2 address:`http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/`, and Tor Project's v3 address: `http://2gzyxa5ihm7nsggfxnu52rck2vv4rvmdlkiu3zzui5du4xyclen53wid.onion/`

If you're an onion service administrator, you must upgrade to v3 onion services as soon as possible.
If you're a user, please ensure that you update your bookmarks to the website's v3 onion addresses.

### What is the timeline for the v2 deprecation?

In September 2020, Tor started warning onion service operators and clients that v2 will be deprecated and obsolete in version 0.4.6.
Tor Browser started warning users in June, 2021.

In July 2021, 0.4.6 Tor will no longer support v2 and support will be removed from the code base.

In October 2021, we will release new Tor client stable versions for all supported series that will disable v2.

You can read more in the Tor Project's blog post [Onion Service version 2 deprecation timeline](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline).

### Can I keep using my v2 onion address? Can I access my v2 onion after September? Is this a backward-incompatible change?

V2 onion addresses are fundamentally insecure. If you have a v2 onion, we recommend you migrate now.
This is a backward incompatible change: v2 onion services will not be reachable after September 2021.

### What is the recommendation for developers to migrate? Any tips on how to spread the new v3 addresses to people?

In torrc, to create a version 3 address, you simply need to create a new service just as you did your v2 service, with these two lines:

```
HiddenServiceDir /full/path/to/your/new/v3/directory/
HiddenServicePort <virtual port> <target-address>:<target-port>

```

The default version is now set to 3 so you don't need to explicitly set it.
Restart tor, and look on your directory for the new address.
If you wish to keep running your version 2 service until it is deprecated to provide a transition path to your users, add this line to the configuration block of your version 2 service:

```
HiddenServiceVersion 2

```

This will allow you to identify in your configuration file which one is which version.

If you have [Onion-Location](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/) configured on your website, you need to set the header with your new v3 address.
For technical documentation about running onion services, please read the [Onion Services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/) page in our Community portal.

### I didn't see the announcement, can I get more time to migrate?

No, v2 onion connections will start failing nowish, first slowly, then suddenly. It's time to move away.

### Will services start failing to be reached in September, or before already?

Already, introduction points are not in Tor 0.4.6 anymore, so they will not be reachable if relay operators update.

### As a website administrator, can I redirect users from my v2 onion to v3?

Yes, it will work until the v2 onion address is unreachable.
You may want to encourage users to update their bookmarks.

### Are v3 onion services going to help in mitigating DDoS problems?

Yes, we are continuously working on improving onion services security.
Some of the work we have in our roadmap is [ESTABLISH\_INTRO Cell DoS Defense Extension](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/305-establish-intro-dos-defense-extention.txt), [Res tokens: Anonymous Credentials for Onion Service DoS Resilience](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/331-res-tokens-for-anti-dos.md), and [A First Take at PoW Over Introduction Circuits](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/327-pow-over-intro.txt).

#### [I cannot reach X.onion!](#onionservices_onionservices-3)

If you cannot reach the onion service you desire, make sure that you have entered the 56-character onion address correctly; even a small mistake will stop Tor Browser from being able to reach the site.
If you are still unable to connect to the onion service, please try again later.
There may be a temporary connection issue, or the site operators may have allowed it to go offline without warning.

You can also ensure that you're able to access other onion services by connecting to [DuckDuckGo's onion service](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/).

#### [What's a client or onion authentication?](#onionservices_client-auth)

An authenticated onion service is an onion service that requires you to provide an authentication token (in this case, a private key) before accessing the service.
The private key is not transmitted to the service, and it's only used to decrypt its descriptor locally.
You can get the access credentials from the onion service operator. Reach out to the operator and request access.
Learn more about [how to use onion authentication](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/onion-services/) in Tor Browser.
If you want to create an onion service with client authentication, please see the [Client Authorization section](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/client-auth) in the Community portal.

#### [What do the different onion icons in the address bar mean?](#onionservices_onionservices-5)

When browsing an Onion Service, Tor Browser displays different onion icons in the address bar indicating the security of the current webpage.

![Image of an onion](static/images/onion-site.png)
An onion means:

* The Onion Service is served over HTTP, or HTTPS with a CA-Issued certificate.
* The Onion Service is served over HTTPS with a Self-Signed certificate.

![Image of an onion with a red slash](static/images/onion-site-broken.png)
An onion with a red slash means:

* The Onion Service is served with a script from an insecure URL.

![Image of an onion with a caution sign](static/images/onion-site-warning.png)
An onion with caution sign means:

* The Onion Service is served over HTTPS with an expired Certificate.
* The Onion Service is served over HTTPS with a wrong Domain.
* The Onion Service is served with a mixed form over an insecure URL.

#### [I've heard about websites that are only accessible over Tor. What are these websites, and how can I access them?](#onionservices_onionservices-1)

Websites that are only accessible over Tor are called "onions" and end in the TLD .onion.
For example, the DuckDuckGo onion is <https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/>.
You can access these websites by using Tor Browser.
The addresses must be shared with you by the website host, as onions are not indexed in search engines in the typical way that vanilla websites are.

##### Misc

#### [How can I share files anonymously through Tor?](#misc_misc-12)

For sharing files over Tor, [OnionShare](https://onionshare.org/) is a good option.
OnionShare is an open source tool for securely and anonymously sending and receiving files using Tor onion services.
It works by starting a web server directly on your computer and making it accessible as an unguessable Tor web address that others can load in Tor Browser to download files from you, or upload files to you.
It doesn't require setting up a separate server, using a third party file-sharing service, or even logging into an account.

Unlike services like email, Google Drive, DropBox, WeTransfer, or nearly any other way people typically send files to each other, when you use OnionShare you don't give any companies access to the files that you're sharing.
So long as you share the unguessable web address in a secure way (like pasting it in an encrypted messaging app), no one but you and the person you're sharing with can access the files.

OnionShare is developed by [Micah Lee](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare).

Many exit nodes are configured to block certain types of file sharing traffic, such as BitTorrent.
BitTorrent in particular is [not anonymous over Tor](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea).

#### [Why don't you prevent bad people from doing bad things when using Tor?](#misc_misc-2)

Tor is designed to defend human rights and privacy by preventing anyone from censoring things, even us.
We hate that there are some people who use Tor to do terrible things, but we can't do anything to get rid of them without also undermining the human rights activists, journalists, abuse survivors, and other people who use Tor for good things.
If we wanted to block certain people from using Tor, we'd basically be adding a backdoor to the software, which would open up our vulnerable users to attacks from bad regimes and other adversaries.

#### [I have a compelling reason to trace a Tor user. Can you help?](#misc_misc-1)

There is nothing the Tor developers can do to trace Tor users.
The same protections that keep bad people from breaking Tor's anonymity also prevent us from tracking users.

#### [How do I volunteer with Tor Project?](#misc_misc-14)

A few things everyone can do now:

1. Please consider [running a relay](https://community.torproject.org/relay/) to help the Tor network grow.
2. Tell your friends! Get them to run relays. Get them to run [onion services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/). Get them to tell their friends.
3. If you like Tor's goals, please take a moment to [donate](https://donate.torproject.org) to support further Tor development.
   We're also looking for more sponsors - if you know any companies, NGOs, agencies, or other organizations that want anonymity / privacy / communications security, let them know about us.
4. We're looking for more [good examples of Tor users](https://community.torproject.org/user-research/persona/) and Tor use cases.
   If you use Tor for a scenario or purpose not yet described on that page, and you're comfortable sharing it with us, we'd love to hear from you.

### Documentation

1. Help [localize](https://community.torproject.org/localization/) the documentation into other languages.
   See [becoming a Tor translator](https://community.torproject.org/localization/becoming-tor-translator/) if you want to help out.
   We especially need Arabic or Farsi translations, for the many Tor users in censored areas.

### Advocacy

1. The Tor community uses the [Tor Forum](https://forum.torproject.org), [IRC/Matrix](https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/irc-help/), and [public mailing lists](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo).
2. Create a presentation that can be used for various user [group meetings](https://community.torproject.org/training/resources/) around the world.
3. Create a poster around a theme, such as "Tor for Human Rights!".
4. Spread the word about Tor at a symposium or conference and use these [Tor brochures](https://community.torproject.org/outreach/kit/) as conversation starter.

#### [How do I check if my application that uses SOCKS is leaking DNS requests?](#misc_check-socks-dns-leaks)

Even if your application is using the correct variant of the SOCKS protocol, there is still a risk that it could be leaking DNS queries.
This problem happens in Firefox extensions that resolve the destination hostname themselves, for example to show you its IP address, what country it's in, etc.
If you suspect your application might behave like this, follow the instructions below to check.

1. Add `TestSocks 1` to your [torrc file](tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/).
2. Start Tor, and point your program's SOCKS proxy settings to Tor's SOCKS5 server (`socks5://127.0.0.1:9050` by default).
3. Watch your logs as you use your application. For each socks connection, Tor will log a `notice` for safe connections, and a `warn` for connections leaking DNS requests.

If you want to automatically disable all connections leaking DNS requests, set `SafeSocks 1` in your torrc file.

#### [You should hide the list of Tor relays, so people can't block the exits.](#misc_hide-exits)

There are a few reasons we don't:

1. We can't help but make the information available, since Tor clients need to use it to pick their paths.
   So if the "blockers" want it, they can get it anyway.
   Further, even if we didn't tell clients about the list of relays directly, somebody could still make a lot of connections through Tor to a test site and build a list of the addresses they see.
2. If people want to block us, we believe that they should be allowed to do so.
   Obviously, we would prefer for everybody to allow Tor users to connect to them, but people have the right to decide who their services should allow connections from, and if they want to block anonymous users, they can.
3. Being blockable also has tactical advantages: it may be a persuasive response to website maintainers who feel threatened by Tor.
   Giving them the option may inspire them to stop and think about whether they really want to eliminate private access to their system, and if not, what other options they might have.
   The time they might otherwise have spent blocking Tor, they may instead spend rethinking their overall approach to privacy and anonymity.

#### [The files on my computer have been locked, and someone is demanding I download Tor Browser to pay a ransom for my files!](#misc_misc-5)

We are so sorry, but you have been infected with malware.
The Tor Project did not create this malware. The malware authors are asking you to download Tor Browser presumably to contact them anonymously with the ransom they're demanding from you.

If this is your first introduction to Tor Browser, we understand that you might think we're bad people who enable even worse people.

But please consider that our software is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by human rights activists, journalists, domestic violence survivors, whistleblowers, law enforcement officers, and many others. Unfortunately, the protection that our software can provide to these groups of people can also be abused by criminals and malware authors.
The Tor Project does not support or condone the use of our software for malicious purposes.

#### [Can I change the number of hops Tor uses?](#misc_misc-11)

Right now the path length is hard-coded at 3 plus the number of nodes in your path that are sensitive.
That is, in normal cases it's 3, but for example if you're accessing an onion service or a ".exit" address it could be more.

We don't want to encourage people to use paths longer than this as it increases load on the network without (as far as we can tell) providing any more security.
Also, using paths longer than 3 could harm anonymity, first because it makes [denial of security](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs07-doa) attacks easier, and second because it could act as an identifier if only a small number of users have the same path length as you.

##### Get in Touch

#### [Why I can't join Tor-dev and other channels?](#get-in-touch_why-i-cant-join-tor-channels)

The #tor-project channel is where Tor people discuss and coordinate daily Tor work. It has fewer members than #tor and is more focused on the work at hand. You are also welcome to join this channel. To access #tor-project, your nickname (nick) must be registered and verified.

Here's how to reach #tor-project and other registered channels.

### Register your nickname

1. Log onto #tor. See [How can I chat with Tor Project teams?](get-in-touch/irc-help/)
2. Then, click on the word **"Status"** at the top left of the screen.
3. In the window at the bottom of the page, type: `/msg nickserv REGISTER yournewpassword youremailaddress`
4. Hit enter.

If all goes well, you will receive a message that you are registered.

The system may register you as your nick\_ instead of your nick.

If so, just go with it but remember you are user\_ and not user.

Every time you log on to IRC, to identify your registered nick, type:

`/nick yournick`

`/msg nickserv IDENTIFY YourPassWord`

### How to verify your nickname

After registering your nickname, to gain access to the #tor-project and other protected channels, your nickname must be **verified**.

1. Go to <https://services.oftc.net/> and follow the steps in the '*To verify your account*' section
2. Go back to the IRC webpage where you are logged in and type:

   `/msg nickserv checkverify`
3. Click ENTER.
4. If all is well, you will receive a message that says:

```
*!NickServ*checkverify

Usermodechange: +R

!NickServ- Successfully set +R on your nick.

```

Your nick is verified!

Now, to join #tor-project, you can just type:

`/join #tor-project` and hit enter.

You will be allowed into the channel. If so, Congratulations!

However, if you get stuck, you can ask for help in the #tor channel.

You can toggle back and forth between channels by clicking on the different channel names at the top left of the IRC window.

#### [How can I chat with Tor Project teams?](#get-in-touch_irc-help)

For a long time, the Tor community has been running many day-to-day activities using the IRC network known as OFTC.
IRC has worked out well for us, and our community on IRC has been evolving over the years with new people joining in and new channels appearing for specific needs in the organization.

### Matrix bridge

The Tor community is opening up its day-to-day conversations by bridging our IRC community to the Matrix network.
For regular Tor users, it means that you can chat with us using a friendly App like [Element](https://app.element.io).
The [#tor:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#tor:matrix.org) room or the #tor IRC channel are connected: whichever platform you chose, your message will be shared on both platforms.

To join the conversation with Tor contributors on Matrix, you need a Matrix account. Several providers can get you one.
One of these is the Matrix.org Foundation, which allows people to register an account for free.
You can register an account on [app.element.io](https://app.element.io).

Once you have a Matrix account, you can either [join the Tor Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#tor-space:matrix.org) to browse the Tor rooms, or directly join the [#tor:matrix.org user support](https://matrix.to/#/#tor:matrix.org) room.

### OFTC IRC network

Alternatively, if you want to use IRC you can use OFTC's web IRC client:

1. Open [OFTC webchat](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=tor)
2. Fill in the blanks:

   **NICKNAME:** Anything you want, but choose the same nickname (nick) every time you use IRC to talk to people on Tor. If your nick is already being used, you will get a message from the system and you should choose another nick.

   **CHANNEL:** #tor
3. Click Enter

Congratulations! You're on IRC.

After a few seconds, you will automatically enter #tor, which is a chatroom with Tor developers, relay operators and other community members. There are some random people in #tor as well.

You can ask questions in the empty bar at the bottom of the screen. Please, don't ask to ask, just ask your question.

People may be able to answer right away, or there may be a bit of a delay (some people are listed on the channel but are away from their keyboards and record channel activities to read later).

If you want to chat with someone specific, start your comment with their nick and they will typically receive a notification that someone is trying to contact them.

OFTC often doesn't allow people to use their webchat over Tor. For this reason, and because many people end up preferring it anyway, you should also consider using an IRC client.

##### Debian Repository

#### [Why and how I can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian?](#apt_tor-deb-repo)

The Tor Project maintains its own [Debian package repository](https://deb.torproject.org). Since Debian provides the LTS version of Tor, this might not always give you the latest stable Tor version. Therefore, it's recommended to install `tor` from our repository.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository in Debian based distributions:

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to running the code as root. This means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, i.e. your user should be in the sudo group.

#### Prerequisite: Verify the CPU architecture

The package repository offers `amd64`, `arm64`, and `i386` binaries. Verify your operating system is capable of running the binary by inspecting the output of the following command:

```
  # dpkg --print-architecture

```

It should output either `amd64`, `arm64`, or `i386`. The repository does not support other CPU architectures.

**Note:** The package repository does not offer 32-bit ARM architecture (`armhf`) images (yet). You should either install the version Debian offers (make sure to check out Debian backports, too, as that one has often a more up-to-date Tor package), or [build Tor from source](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/install/#installing-tor-from-source).

#### 1. Install `apt-transport-https`

To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages available in sources accessible over https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).

```
   # apt install apt-transport-https

```
#### 2. Create a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` named `tor.list`. Add the following entries:

```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main

```

If you want to try experimental packages, add these **in addition** to the lines from above:

```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-experimental-<DISTRIBUTION> main

```

Or nightly builds:

```
   deb     [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main

```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to check the Operating System version.

**Note:** Ubuntu Focal dropped support for 32-bit, so instead use:

```
   deb     [arch=<ARCHITECTURE> signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main
   deb-src [arch=<ARCHITECTURE> signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal main

```

Replace `<ARCHITECTURE>` with your system architecture (you found it earlier by writing `dpkg --print-architecture`).

Warning symptom, when running sudo apt update:

```
   Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org focal InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'

```
#### 3. Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following command at your command prompt:

```
   # wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

```
#### 4. Install tor and tor debian keyring

We provide a Debian package to help you keep our signing key current. It is recommended you use it. Install it with the following commands:

```
   # apt update
   # apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring

```

#### [Can I use tor from Ubuntu's repository?](#apt_tor-ubuntu)

**No.** Do not use the packages in Ubuntu's universe.
In the past they have not been reliably updated. That means you could be missing stability and security fixes.
Instead, please use [Tor Debian repository](apt/tor-deb-repo/).

#### [Can I use APT over Tor?](#apt_apt-3)

Yes, `deb.torproject.org` is also served through via an Onion Service: <http://apow7mjfryruh65chtdydfmqfpj5btws7nbocgtaovhvezgccyjazpqd.onion/>

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to running the code as root. This means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, i.e. your user should be in the sudo group.

To use Apt over Tor, the apt transport needs to be installed:

```
   # apt install apt-transport-tor

```

Then you need to add the following entries to `/etc/apt/sources.list` or a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`:

```
   # For the stable version.
   deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] tor+http://apow7mjfryruh65chtdydfmqfpj5btws7nbocgtaovhvezgccyjazpqd.onion/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main

   # For the unstable version.
   deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] tor+http://apow7mjfryruh65chtdydfmqfpj5btws7nbocgtaovhvezgccyjazpqd.onion/torproject.org tor-nightly-main-<DISTRIBUTION> main

```

Replace `<DISTRIBUTION>` with your Operating System codename. Run `lsb_release -c` or `cat /etc/debian_version` to check the Operating System version.

Since Debian bookworm you can also use the more modern deb822-style:

```
   # echo "\
     Types: deb deb-src
     Components: main
     Suites: bookworm
     URIs: tor+http://apow7mjfryruh65chtdydfmqfpj5btws7nbocgtaovhvezgccyjazpqd.onion/torproject.org
     Architectures: amd64 arm64 i386
     Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg
     " | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.sources

##### Tor rpm packages

#### [How can I install Tor rpm package](#rpm_install)

The Tor Project maintains its own [RPM package repository](https://rpm.torproject.org) for CentOS and RHEL and Fedora.

> **Note:** The symbol # refers to be running the code as root. That means you should have access to a user account with system administration privileges, e.g your user should be in the sudo group.

Here's how you can enable Tor Package Repository for both CentOS and RHEL and Fedora:

### 1. Enable epel repository (only for CentOS and RHEL)

```
âª# dnf install epel-release -y

```
### 2. Add the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/tor.repo

For CentOS or RHEL:

```
[tor]
name=Tor for Enterprise Linux $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/public_gpg.key
cost=100

```

For Fedora:

```
[tor]
name=Tor for Fedora $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://rpm.torproject.org/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.torproject.org/fedora/public_gpg.key
cost=100

```
### 3. Install the Tor package

Then you can install the latest Tor package.

```
âª# dnf install tor -y

```

Using it for the first time, you will have to import the GPG public key.

```
Importing GPG key 0x3621CD35:

##### Abuse FAQ

#### [I'd run a relay, but I don't want to deal with abuse issues.](#abuse_exit-policies)

Great. That's exactly why we implemented exit policies.

Each Tor relay has an exit policy that specifies what sort of outbound connections are allowed or refused from that relay.
The exit policies are propagated to Tor clients via the directory, so clients will automatically avoid picking exit relays that would refuse to exit to their intended destination.
This way each relay can decide the services, hosts, and networks it wants to allow connections to, based on abuse potential and its own situation.
Read the [Support entry on issues you might encounter](abuse/exit-relay-expectations/) if you use the default exit policy, and then read Mike Perry's [tips for running an exit node with minimal harassment](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node).

The default exit policy allows access to many popular services (e.g. web browsing), but restricts some due to abuse potential (e.g. mail) and some since the Tor network can't handle the load (e.g. default file-sharing ports).
You can change your exit policy by editing your torrc file.
If you want to avoid most if not all abuse potential, set it to "reject \*:\*".
This setting means that your relay will be used for relaying traffic inside the Tor network, but not for connections to external websites or other services.

If you do allow any exit connections, make sure name resolution works (that is, your computer can resolve Internet addresses correctly).
If there are any resources that your computer can't reach (for example, you are behind a restrictive firewall or content filter), please explicitly reject them in your exit policy otherwise Tor users will be impacted too.

#### [Doesn't Tor enable criminals to do bad things?](#abuse_what-about-criminals)

Tor's mission is to advance human rights with free and open-source technology, empowering users to defend against mass surveillance and internet censorship.
We hate that there are some people who use Tor for nefarious purposes, and we condemn the misuse and exploitation of our technology for criminal activity.

It's essential to understand that criminal intent lies with the individuals and not the tools they use.
Just like other widely available technology, Tor can be used by individuals with criminal intent.
And because of other options they can use it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from engaging in criminal activity.
At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and be used by law enforcement to investigate crime and help support survivors.

#### [What about distributed denial of service attacks?](#abuse_ddos)

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks typically rely on having a group of thousands of computers all sending floods of traffic to a victim.
Since the goal is to overpower the bandwidth of the victim, they typically send UDP packets since those don't require handshakes or coordination.

But because Tor only transports correctly formed TCP streams, not all IP packets, you cannot send UDP packets over Tor.
(You can't do specialized forms of this attack like SYN flooding either.)
So ordinary DDoS attacks are not possible over Tor. Tor also doesn't allow bandwidth amplification attacks against external sites:
you need to send in a byte for every byte that the Tor network will send to your destination.
So in general, attackers who control enough bandwidth to launch an effective DDoS attack can do it just fine without Tor.

#### [What about spammers?](#abuse_what-about-spammers)

First of all, the default Tor exit policy rejects all outgoing port 25 (SMTP) traffic.
So sending spam mail through Tor isn't going to work by default.
It's possible that some relay operators will enable port 25 on their particular exit node, in which case that computer will allow outgoing mails; but that individual could just set up an open mail relay too, independent of Tor.
In short, Tor isn't useful for spamming, because nearly all Tor relays refuse to deliver the mail.

Of course, it's not all about delivering the mail.
Spammers can use Tor to connect to open HTTP proxies (and from there to SMTP servers); to connect to badly written mail-sending CGI scripts; and to control their botnets â that is, to covertly communicate with armies of compromised computers that deliver the spam.

This is a shame, but notice that spammers are already doing great without Tor.
Also, remember that many of their more subtle communication mechanisms (like spoofed UDP packets) can't be used over Tor, because it only transports correctly-formed TCP connections.

#### [Does Tor get much abuse?](#abuse_how-much-abuse)

Tor has implemented exit policies.
Each Tor relay has an exit policy that specifies what sort of outbound connections are allowed or refused from that relay.
This way each relay can decide the services, hosts, and networks it wants to allow connections to, based on abuse potential and its own situation.
We also have a dedicated team, Network Health, to investigate bad relay behavior and kick them out of the network.

It is important to note that while we can combat some type of abuse like bad relays in our network, we can't see or manage what users do on the network and that is by design.
This design overwhelmingly allows for beneficial uses by providing human rights activists, journalists, domestic violence survivors, whistleblowers, law enforcement officers, and many others with as much privacy and anonymity as possible.

#### [So what should I expect if I run an exit relay?](#abuse_exit-relay-expectations)

If you run a Tor relay that allows exit connections (such as the default exit policy), it's probably safe to say that you will eventually hear from somebody.
Abuse complaints may come in a variety of forms. For example:

* Somebody connects to Hotmail, and sends a ransom note to a company. The FBI sends you a polite email, you explain that you run a Tor relay, and they say "oh well" and leave you alone. [Port 80]
* Somebody tries to get you shut down by using Tor to connect to Google groups and post spam to Usenet, and then sends an angry mail to your ISP about how you're destroying the world. [Port 80]
* Somebody connects to an IRC network and makes a nuisance of himself. Your ISP gets polite mail about how your computer has been compromised; and/or your computer gets DDoSed. [Port 6667]
* Somebody uses Tor to download a Vin Diesel movie, and your ISP gets a DMCA takedown notice. See EFF's [Tor DMCA Response Template](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/eff-tor-legal-faq/tor-dmca-response/), which explains why your ISP can probably ignore the notice without any liability. [Arbitrary ports]

Some hosting providers are friendlier than others when it comes to Tor exits. For a listing see the [good and bad ISPs wiki](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/).

For a complete set of template responses to different abuse complaint types, see the [collection of templates](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/tor-abuse-templates/).
You can also proactively reduce the amount of abuse you get by following [these tips for running an exit node with minimal harassment](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node) and [running a reduced exit policy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReducedExitPolicy).

You might also find that your Tor relay's IP is blocked from accessing some Internet sites/services.
This might happen regardless of your exit policy, because some groups don't seem to know or care that Tor has exit policies.
(If you have a spare IP not used for other activities, you might consider running your Tor relay on it.)
In general, it's advisable not to use your home internet connection to provide a Tor relay.

#### [Tor is banned from the IRC network I want to use.](#abuse_irc-ban)

Sometimes jerks make use of Tor to troll IRC channels.
This abuse results in IP-specific temporary bans ("klines" in IRC lingo), as the network operators try to keep the troll off of their network.

This response underscores a fundamental flaw in IRC's security model:
they assume that IP addresses equate to humans, and by banning the IP address they can ban the human.
In reality, this is not the case â many such trolls routinely make use of the literally millions of open proxies and compromised computers around the Internet.
The IRC networks are fighting a losing battle of trying to block all these nodes, and an entire cottage industry of blocklists and counter-trolls has sprung up based on this flawed security model (not unlike the antivirus industry).
The Tor network is just a drop in the bucket here.

On the other hand, from the viewpoint of IRC server operators, security is not an all-or-nothing thing.
By responding quickly to trolls or any other social attack, it may be possible to make the attack scenario less attractive to the attacker.
And most individual IP addresses do equate to individual humans, on any given IRC network at any given time.
The exceptions include NAT gateways which may be allocated access as special cases.
While it's a losing battle to try to stop the use of open proxies, it's not generally a losing battle to keep klining a single ill-behaved IRC user until that user gets bored and goes away.

But the real answer is to implement application-level auth systems, to let in well-behaving users and keep out badly-behaving users.
This needs to be based on some property of the human (such as a password they know), not some property of the way their packets are transported.

Of course, not all IRC networks are trying to ban Tor nodes.
After all, quite a few people use Tor to IRC in privacy in order to carry on legitimate communications without tying them to their real-world identity.
Each IRC network needs to decide for itself if blocking a few more of the millions of IPs that bad people can use is worth losing the contributions from the well-behaved Tor users.

If you're being blocked, have a discussion with the network operators and explain the issues to them.
They may not be aware of the existence of Tor at all, or they may not be aware that the hostnames they're klining are Tor exit nodes.
If you explain the problem, and they conclude that Tor ought to be blocked, you may want to consider moving to a network that is more open to free speech.
Maybe inviting them to #tor on irc.oftc.net will help show them that we are not all evil people.

Finally, if you become aware of an IRC network that seems to be blocking Tor, or a single Tor exit node, please put that information on [The Tor IRC block tracker](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/BlockingIrc) so that others can share.
At least one IRC network consults that page to unblock exit nodes that have been blocked inadvertently.

#### [Your nodes are banned from the mail server I want to use.](#abuse_nodes-banned-from-mail-server)

Even though [Tor isn't useful for spamming](abuse/what-about-spammers/), some over-zealous blocklisters seem to think that all open networks like Tor are evil â they attempt to strong-arm network administrators on policy, service, and routing issues, and then extract ransoms from victims.

If your server administrators decide to make use of these blocklists to refuse incoming mail, you should have a conversation with them and explain about Tor and Tor's exit policies.

#### [I want to ban the Tor network from my service.](#abuse_ban-tor)

We're sorry to hear that.
There are some situations where it makes sense to block anonymous users for an Internet service.
But in many cases, there are easier solutions that can solve your problem while still allowing users to access your website securely.

First, ask yourself if there's a way to do application-level decisions to separate the legitimate users from the jerks.
For example, you might have certain areas of the site, or certain privileges like posting, available only to people who are registered.
It's easy to build an up-to-date list of Tor IP addresses that allow connections to your service, so you could set up this distinction only for Tor users.
This way you can have multi-tiered access and not have to ban every aspect of your service.

For example, the Freenode IRC network had a problem with a coordinated group of abusers joining channels and subtly taking over the conversation; but when they labeled all users coming from Tor nodes as "anonymous users", removing the ability of the abusers to blend in, the abusers moved back to using their open proxies and bot networks.

Second, consider that hundreds of thousands of people use Tor every day simply for good data hygiene â for example, to protect against data-gathering advertising companies while going about their normal activities.
Others use Tor because it's their only way to get past restrictive local firewalls.
Some Tor users may be legitimately connecting to your service right now to carry on normal activities.
You need to decide whether banning the Tor network is worth losing the contributions of these users, as well as potential future legitimate users.
(Often people don't have a good measure of how many polite Tor users are connecting to their service â you never notice them until there's an impolite one.)

At this point, you should also ask yourself what you do about other services that aggregate many users behind a few IP addresses.
Tor is not so different from AOL in this respect.

Lastly, please remember that Tor relays have [individual exit policies](relay-operators/exit-policies/).
Many Tor relays do not allow exiting connections at all.
Many of those that do allow some exit connections might already disallow connections to your service.
When you go about banning nodes, you should parse the exit policies and only block the ones that allow these connections; and you should keep in mind that exit policies can change (as well as the overall list of nodes in the network).

If you really want to do this, we provide a [Tor exit relay list](https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py) or a [DNS-based list you can query](https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel.html.en).

(Some system administrators block ranges of IP addresses because of official policy or some abuse pattern, but some have also asked about allowing Tor exit relays because they want to permit access to their systems only using Tor.
These scripts are usable for allowlisting as well.)

#### [I have a compelling reason to trace a Tor user. Can you help?](#abuse_help-trace-tor-user)

There is nothing the Tor developers can do to trace Tor users.
The same protections that keep bad people from breaking Tor's anonymity also prevent us from figuring out what's going on.

Some fans have suggested that we redesign Tor to include a [backdoor](about/backdoor/).
There are two problems with this idea.
First, it technically weakens the system too far.
Having a central way to link users to their activities is a gaping hole for all sorts of attackers; and the policy mechanisms needed to ensure correct handling of this responsibility are enormous and unsolved.
Second, the [bad people aren't going to get caught by this anyway](abuse/what-about-criminals/), since they will use other means to ensure their anonymity (identity theft, compromising computers and using them as bounce points, etc).

This ultimately means that it is the responsibility of site owners to protect themselves against compromise and security issues that can come from anywhere.
This is just part of signing up for the benefits of the Internet.
You must be prepared to secure yourself against the bad elements, wherever they may come from.
Tracking and increased surveillance are not the answer to preventing abuse.

But remember that this doesn't mean that Tor is invulnerable.
Traditional police techniques can still be very effective against Tor, such as investigating means, motive, and opportunity, interviewing suspects, writing style analysis, technical analysis of the content itself, sting operations, keyboard taps, and other physical investigations.
The Tor Project is also happy to work with everyone including law enforcement groups to train them how to use the Tor software to safely conduct investigations or anonymized activities online.

#### [I want some content removed from a .onion address.](#abuse_remove-content)

The Tor Project does not host, control, nor have the ability to discover the owner or location of a .onion address.
The .onion address is an address from [an onion service](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/onion-services/).
The name you see ending in .onion is an onion service descriptor.
It's an automatically generated name which can be located on any Tor relay or client anywhere on the Internet.
Onion services are designed to protect both the user and service provider from discovering who they are and where they are from.
The design of onion services means the owner and location of the .onion site is hidden even from us.

But remember that this doesn't mean that onion services are invulnerable.
Traditional police techniques can still be very effective against them, such as interviewing suspects, writing style analysis, technical analysis of the content itself, sting operations, keyboard taps, and other physical investigations.

If you have a complaint about child abuse materials, you may wish to report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which serves as a national coordination point for investigation of child pornography: <http://www.missingkids.com/>.
We do not view links you report.

#### [Where does Tor Project stand on abusers using technology?](#abuse_abuse-opinion)

We take abuse seriously.
Activists and law enforcement use Tor to investigate abuse and help support survivors.
We work with them to help them understand how Tor can help their work.
In some cases, technological mistakes are being made and we help to correct them.
Because some people in survivors' communities embrace stigma instead of compassion, seeking support from fellow victims requires privacy-preserving technology.

Our refusal to build backdoors and censorship into Tor is not because of a lack of concern.
We refuse to weaken Tor because it would harm efforts to combat child abuse and human trafficking in the physical world, while removing safe spaces for victims online.
Meanwhile, criminals would still have access to botnets, stolen phones, hacked hosting accounts, the postal system, couriers, corrupt officials, and whatever technology emerges to trade content.
They are early adopters of technology.
In the face of this, it is dangerous for policymakers to assume that blocking and filtering is sufficient.
We are more interested in helping efforts to halt and prevent child abuse than helping politicians score points with constituents by hiding it.
The role of corruption is especially troubling; see this United Nations report on [The Role of Corruption in Trafficking in Persons](http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/2011/Issue_Paper_-_The_Role_of_Corruption_in_Trafficking_in_Persons.pdf).

Finally, it is important to consider the world that children will encounter as adults when enacting policy in their name.
Will they thank us if they are unable to voice their opinions safely as adults?
What if they are trying to expose a failure of the state to protect other children?

##### Tor Metrics

#### [How is it even possible to count users in an anonymity network?](#metrics_user-estimation)

We actually don't count users, but we count requests to the directories that clients make periodically to update their list of relays and estimate number of users indirectly from there.

#### [Do all directories report these directory request numbers?](#metrics_directories-reports)

No, but we can see what fraction of directories reported them, and then we can extrapolate the total number in the network.

#### [How do you get from these directory requests to user numbers?](#metrics_user-numbers)

We put in the assumption that the average client makes 10 such requests per day.
A tor client that is connected 24/7 makes about 15 requests per day, but not all clients are connected 24/7, so we picked the number 10 for the average client.
We simply divide directory requests by 10 and consider the result as the number of users.
Another way of looking at it, is that we assume that each request represents a client that stays online for one tenth of a day, so 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Average number of concurrent users, estimated from data collected over a day. We can't say how many distinct users there are.

#### [Are there more fine-grained numbers available, for example, on the number of users per hour?](#metrics_stats-report)

No, the relays that report these statistics aggregate requests by country of origin and over a period of 24 hours.
The statistics we would need to gather for the number of users per hour would be too detailed and might put users at risk.

Then we count those users as one. We really count clients, but it's more intuitive for most people to think of users, that's why we say users and not clients.

#### [What if a user runs Tor on a laptop and changes their IP address a few times per day? Don't you overcount that user?](#metrics_user-overcount)

No, because that user updates their list of relays as often as a user that doesn't change IP address over the day.

#### [Why are there so few bridge users that are not using the default OR protocol or that are using IPv6?](#metrics_bridges-reports)

Very few bridges report data on transports or IP versions yet, and by default we consider requests to use the default OR protocol and IPv4.
Once more bridges report these data, the numbers will become more accurate.

#### [Why do the graphs end 2 days in the past and not today?](#metrics_graphs)

Relays and bridges report some of the data in 24-hour intervals which may end at any time of the day.

And after such an interval is over relays and bridges might take another 18 hours to report the data.

We cut off the last two days from the graphs, because we want to avoid that the last data point in a graph indicates a recent trend change which is in fact just an artifact of the algorithm.

#### [But I noticed that the last data point went up/down a bit since I last looked a few hours ago. Why is that?](#metrics_graph-data-point)

The reason is that we publish user numbers once we're confident enough that they won't change significantly anymore.
But it's always possible that a directory reports data a few hours after we were confident enough, but which then slightly changed the graph.

##### Little-t-tor

#### [How to install little-t-tor?](#little-t-tor_install-little-t-tor)

**Attention: These instructions are meant for installing `tor` the network daemon i.e. [little-t-tor](glossary/little-t-tor/).**
**For instructions on installing Tor Browser, refer to [Tor Browser user manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/).**

**Admin access: To install Tor you need root privileges.**
Below all commands that need to be run as root user like apt and dpkg are prepended with '`#`', while commands to be run as user with '`$`' resembling the standard prompt in a terminal.

## Debian / Ubuntu

**Do not use the packages in Ubuntu's universe**.
In the past they have not reliably been updated.
That means you could be missing stability and security fixes.

#### Configure Tor package repository.

Enable the Tor Project APT repository by following the [instructions](apt/tor-deb-repo/).

#### Package installation

`# apt install tor`

## Fedora

#### Configure Tor Package repository

Enable the Tor Project's RPM package repository by following the [instructions](rpm/tor-rpm-install/).

#### Package installation

`# dnf install tor`

## FreeBSD

#### Package installation

`# pkg install tor`

## OpenBSD

#### Package installation

`# pkg_add tor`

## macOS

#### Install a package manager

There are two package managers on OS X: Homebrew and Macports.
You can use the package manager of your choice.

To install Homebrew follow the instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

To install Macports follow the instructions on [macports.org](https://www.macports.org/install.php).

#### Package installation

If you are using Homebrew in a Terminal window, run:

`# brew install tor`

If you are using Macports in a Terminal window, run:

`$ sudo port install tor`

## Arch Linux

To install the `tor` package on Arch Linux, run:

`# pacman -Syu tor`

## DragonFlyBSD

#### Bootstrap `pkg`

DragonFlyBSD's daily snapshots and releases (starting with 3.4) come with `pkg` already installed. Upgrades from earlier releases, however, will not have it. If `pkg` is missing on the system for any reason, it can be quickly bootstrapped without having to build it from source or even having **DPorts** installed:

```
# cd /usr
# make pkg-bootstrap
# rehash
# pkg-static install -y pkg
# rehash

```
#### Recommended steps to setup `pkg`

Here, it will be similar to what we have on a **FreeBSD** system, and we are going to use HTTPS to fetch our packages, and updates - so here we also need an extra package to help us out (`ca_root_nss`).

#### Installing the `ca_root_nss` package:

`# pkg install ca_root_nss`

For fresh installations, the file `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest.conf.sample` is copied to `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest`. The files ending in the ".sample" extension are ignored; pkg(8) only reads files that end in ".conf" and it will read as many as it finds.

DragonflyBSD has 2 packages repositories:

* Avalon (mirror-master.dragonflybsd.org);
* Wolfpond (pkg.wolfpond.org).

We can simply edit the **URL** used to point out the repositories on `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest` and that's it! Remember to use **pkg+https://** for Avalon.

After applying all these changes, we update the packages list again and try to check if there's already a new update to apply:

```
# pkg update -f
# pkg upgrade -y -f

```
#### Package installation

Install the `tor` package:

`# pkg install tor`

## NetBSD

#### Setup `pkg_add`

Modern versions of the NetBSD operating system can be set to use `pkgin`, which is a piece of software aimed to be like `apt` or `yum` for managing pkgsrc binary packages. We are not convering its setup here, and opt to use plain `pkg_add` instead.

`# echo "PKG_PATH=http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/$(uname -m)/$(uname -r)/All" > /etc/pkg_install.conf`

#### Package installation

Install `tor` NetBSD's package:

`# pkg_add tor`

## Void Linux

To install the `tor` package on Void Linux, please run:

`# xbps-install -S tor`

#### Installing Tor from source

##### Download latest release and dependencies

The latest release of Tor can be found on the [download](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/) page.

If you're building from source, first install [libevent](http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/), and make sure you have openssl and zlib (including the -devel packages if applicable).

##### Install `tor`

`tar -xzf tor-<version>.tar.gz; cd tor-<version>`

**Replace `<version>` with the latest version of `tor`, for example, `tor-0.4.8.12`**

`./configure && make`

Now you can run tor as `src/app/tor` (0.4.3.x and later), or you can run `make install` (as root if necessary) to install it into `/usr/local/`, and then you can start it just by running tor.

#### [How can I verify tor source code?](#little-t-tor_verify-little-t-tor)

**Attention: These instructions are to verify the tor source code.**
**Please follow the right instructions to verify [Tor Browser's signature](tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).**

Digital signature is a process ensuring that a certain package was generated by its developers and has not been tampered with.
Below we explain why it is important and how to verify that the [tor source code](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/) you download is the one we have created and has not been modified by some attacker.

Each file on our [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor) is accompanied by two files which are labelled "checksum" and "sig" with the same name as the package and the extension ".sha256sum" and ".sha256sum.asc" respectively.

The `.asc` file will verify that the `.sha256sum` file (containing the checksum of the package) has not been tampered with. Once the signature has been validated (see below on how to do it), the package integrity can be validated with:

`$ sha256sum -c *.sha256sum`

These files allow you to verify the file you've downloaded is exactly the one that we intended you to get.
This will vary by web browser, but generally you can download this file by right-clicking the "sig" and "checksum" link and selecting the "save file as" option.

For example, `tor-0.4.6.7.tar.gz` is accompanied by `tor-0.4.6.7.tar.gz.sha256sum.asc`.
These are example file names and will not exactly match the file names that you download.

We now show how you can verify the downloaded file's digital signature on different operating systems.
Please notice that a signature is dated the moment the package has been signed.
Therefore every time a new file is uploaded a new signature is generated with a different date.
As long as you have verified the signature you should not worry that the reported date may vary.

### Installing GnuPG

First of all you need to have GnuPG installed before you can verify signatures.

#### For Windows users:

If you run Windows, [download Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html) and run its installer.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in windows command-line, `cmd.exe`.

#### For macOS users:

If you are using macOS, you can [install GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org).

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in the Terminal (under "Applications").

#### For GNU/Linux users:

If you are using GNU/Linux, then you probably already have GnuPG in your system, as most GNU/Linux distributions come with it preinstalled.

In order to verify the signature you will need to type a few commands in a terminal window.
How to do this will vary depending on your distribution.

If you get an error message, something has gone wrong and you cannot continue until you've figured out why this didn't work.
You might be able to import the key using the **Workaround (using a public key)** section instead.

After importing the key, you can save it to a file (identifying it by its fingerprint here):

```
$ gpg --output ./tor.keyring --export 0x2133BC600AB133E1D826D173FE43009C4607B1FB

```

This command results in the key being saved to a file found at the path `./tor.keyring`, i.e. in the current directory.
If `./tor.keyring` doesn't exist after running this command, something has gone wrong and you cannot continue until you've figured out why this didn't work.

### Verifying the signature

To verify the signature of the package you downloaded, you will need to download the corresponding `.sha256sum.asc` signature file and the `.sha256sum` file itself, and verify it with a command that asks GnuPG to verify the file that you downloaded.

The examples below assume that you downloaded these two files to your "Downloads" folder.
Note that these commands use example file names and yours will be different: you will have downloaded a different version than 9.0 and you may not have chosen the English (en-US) version.

#### For Windows users:

```
gpgv --keyring .\tor.keyring Downloads\tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum.asc Downloads\tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum

```
#### For macOS users:

```
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum.asc ~/Downloads/tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum

```
#### For BSD/Linux users:

```
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ~/Downloads/tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum.asc ~/Downloads/tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum

```

The result of the command should produce something like this (depending on which key signed it):

```
gpgv: Signature made Mon 16 Aug 2021 04:44:27 PM -03
gpgv:                using RSA key 7A02B3521DC75C542BA015456AFEE6D49E92B601
gpgv: Good signature from "Nick Mathewson <nickm@torproject.org>"

```

If you get error messages containing 'No such file or directory', either something went wrong with one of the previous steps, or you forgot that these commands use example file names and yours will be a little different.

You may also want to [learn more about GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/).

### Verifying checksum

Now that we validated the signatures of the checksum, we need to verify the integrity of the package.

#### For Windows users:

```
certUtil -hashfile tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum SHA256

```
#### For macOS users:

```
shasum -a 256 tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum

```
#### For BSD/Linux users:

```
sha256sum -c tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz.sha256sum

```

##### Alternate Designs We Don't Do (Yet)

#### [You should let the network pick the path, not the client.](#alternate-designs_let-the-network-pick-the-path)

No, you cannot trust the network to pick the path.
Malicious relays could route you through their colluding friends.
This would give an adversary the ability to watch all of your traffic end to end.

  [Permalink](alternate-designs/let-the-network-pick-the-path/)

#### [You should transport all IP packets, not just TCP packets.](#alternate-designs_transport-all-ip-packets)

This would be handy for a number of reasons:
It would make Tor better able to handle new protocols like VoIP.
It could solve the whole need to socksify applications.
[Exit relays](glossary/exit) would also not need to allocate a lot of file descriptors for all the exit connections.

We're heading in this direction. Some of the hard problems are:

1. IP packets reveal OS characteristics.
   We would still need to do IP-level packet normalization, to stop things like TCP fingerprinting attacks.
   Given the diversity and complexity of TCP stacks, along with device fingerprinting attacks, it looks like our best bet is shipping our own user-space TCP stack.
2. Application-level streams still need scrubbing.
   We will still need user-side applications like Torbutton.
   So it won't become just a matter of capturing packets and anonymizing them at the IP layer.
3. Certain protocols will still leak information.
   For example, we must rewrite DNS requests so they are delivered to an unlinkable DNS server rather than the DNS server at a user's ISP; thus, we must understand the protocols we are transporting.
4. DTLS (datagram TLS) basically has no users, and IPsec sure is big.
   Once we've picked a transport mechanism, we need to design a new end-to-end Tor protocol for avoiding tagging attacks and other potential anonymity and integrity issues now that we allow drops, resends, et cetera.
5. Exit policies for arbitrary IP packets mean building a secure Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
   Our node operators tell us that exit policies are one of the main reasons they're willing to run Tor.
   Adding an IDS to handle exit policies would increase the security complexity of Tor, and would likely not work anyway, as evidenced by the entire field of IDS and counter-IDS papers.
   Many potential abuse issues are resolved by the fact that Tor only transports valid TCP streams (as opposed to arbitrary IP including malformed packets and IP floods.)
   Exit policies become even more important as we become able to transport IP packets.
   We also need to compactly describe exit policies in the Tor directory, so clients can predict which nodes will allow their packets to exit.
   Clients also need to predict all the packets they will want to send in a session before picking their exit node!
6. The Tor-internal name spaces would need to be redesigned.
   We support onion service ".onion" addresses by intercepting the addresses when they are passed to the Tor client.
   Doing so at the IP level will require a more complex interface between Tor and the local DNS resolver.

#### [Exit policies should be able to block websites, not just IP addresses.](#alternate-designs_block-websites)

It would be nice to let relay operators say things like `reject www.slashdot.org` in their exit policies, rather than requiring them to learn all the IP address space that could be covered by the site (and then also blocking other sites at those IP addresses).

There are two problems, though.
First, users could still get around these blocks.
For example, they could request the IP address rather than the hostname when they exit from the Tor network.
This means operators would still need to learn all the IP addresses for the destinations in question.

The second problem is that it would allow remote attackers to censor arbitrary sites.
For example, if a Tor operator blocks www1.slashdot.org, and then some attacker poisons the Tor relay's DNS or otherwise changes that hostname to resolve to the IP address for a major news site, then suddenly that Tor relay is blocking the news site.

#### [You should make every Tor user be a relay.](#alternate-designs_make-every-user-a-relay)

Requiring every Tor user to be a relay would help with scaling the network to handle all our users, and [running a Tor relay may help your anonymity](relay-operators/better-anonymity).
However, many Tor users cannot be good relays â for example, some Tor clients operate from behind restrictive firewalls, connect via modem, or otherwise aren't in a position where they can relay traffic.
Providing service to these clients is a critical part of providing effective anonymity for everyone, since many Tor users are subject to these or similar constraints and including these clients increases the size of the anonymity set.

That said, we do want to encourage Tor users to run relays, so what we really want to do is simplify the process of setting up and maintaining a relay.
We've made a lot of progress with easy configuration in the past few years: Tor is good at automatically detecting whether it's reachable and how much bandwidth it can offer.

There are four steps we need to address before we can do this though:

* First, we still need to get better at automatically estimating the right amount of bandwidth to allow.
  It might be that [switching to UDP transport](alternate-designs/transport-all-ip-packets) is the simplest answer here â which alas is not a very simple answer at all.
* Second, we need to work on scalability, both of the network (how to stop requiring that all Tor relays be able to connect to all Tor relays) and of the directory (how to stop requiring that all Tor users know about all Tor relays).
  Changes like this can have large impact on potential and actual anonymity.
  See Section 5 of the [Challenges](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/challenges.pdf) paper for details.
  Again, UDP transport would help here.
* Third, we need to better understand the risks from letting the attacker send traffic through your relay while you're also initiating your own anonymized traffic.
  [Three](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#back01) [different](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#clog-the-queue) [research](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#torta05) papers describe ways to identify the relays in a circuit by running traffic through candidate relays and looking for dips in the traffic while the circuit is active.
  These clogging attacks are not that scary in the Tor context so long as relays are never clients too.
  But if we're trying to encourage more clients to turn on relay functionality too (whether as [bridge relays](censorship/censorship-7) or as normal relays), then we need to understand this threat better and learn how to mitigate it.
* Fourth, we might need some sort of incentive scheme to encourage people to relay traffic for others, and/or to become exit nodes.
  [Here are our current thoughts on Tor incentives](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor).

Please help on all of these!

##### Mullvad Browser

#### [What is Mullvad Browser?](#mullvad-browser_what-is-mullvad-browser)

Mullvad Browser is Tor Browser without the Tor Network - that allows anyone to take advantage of all the privacy features Tor created.
If people want to connect the browser with a VPN they trust, they can easily do so.

The browser's 'out-of-the-box' configurations and settings will mask many parameters and features commonly used to extract information from a person's device, including fonts, rendered content, and several hardware APIs.
By default, Mullvad Browser has private mode enabled, blocks third-party trackers and cookies.

The browser is free and open-source and was developed by the Tor Project in collaboration with Mullvad VPN.
It is distributed by Mullvad and can be downloaded on their [website](https://mullvad.net/browser).

#### [What is the difference between Mullvad Browser and Tor Browser?](#mullvad-browser_what-is-difference-mullvad-browser-tor-browser)

Mullvad Browser is free and open-source software that connects to the internet (if you use it together with Mullvad VPN) through the encrypted VPN tunnels and VPN servers of Mullvad.
You can use it without or with any VPN, but you should make sure to use a VPN provider you can trust.
Aside from the way that both browsers connect users to the internet (Tor network vs trusted VPN connection) the differences between both browsers are very small and come down to individual preference and use cases for the end-user.

As a benefit of connecting to the internet using the Tor network, various Tor specific features are closely integrated with our own browser that Mullvad Browser does not offer, including:

* Circuit isolation and the integration with new-identity
* Access to Onion Services (i.e. onionsites, Onion-Location redirects, onion authentication, and SecureDrop integration)
* Built-in censorship circumvention with a unique UX found in Tor Browser's connection settings and connection assist

Our objective with this collaboration is to provide more choice for online privacy (e.g., minimize fingerprinting and try to prevent linkability) to users at all levels.

#### [When should I use Mullvad Browser?](#mullvad-browser_when-use-mullvad-browser)

You should use Mullvad Browser if you are looking for a privacy enhanced browser solution to connect with your trusted VPN.
Its default settings and features are intended to combat mass surveillance, data mining and tracking, or other privacy violations that are commonly employed by big tech companies.

While Mullvad Browser offers similar privacy protections to Tor Browser, it is best suited for the threat model of corporate mass-surveillance by big tech companies.

#### [Why should I trust Mullvad Browser?](#mullvad-browser_why-trust-mullvad-browser)

Unlike other browsers on the market, Mullvad Browser's business model does not rely on capitalizing on users' behavioral data.
Mullvad makes money by selling their VPN, they are not in the business of selling user data from the browser.

Mullvad Browser was developed by the Tor Project who have a proven track record of building and deploying free and open-source privacy preserving technologies such as Tor Browser, Onion Services, the Tor network etc. that have helped millions of people from at-risk communities defend their right to privacy and anonymity online.

Mullvad has been part of the Tor community for many years now.
They are a Shallot Level member (highest membership tier) of the [Tor Project membership program](https://www.torproject.org/about/membership/) and have been a founding member of the Tor Project's Membership Program.

When Mullvad approached us to jointly develop a browser, we said yes because there is great value alignment between our two organizations in our efforts to make privacy-enhancing technologies more widely available and make mass-surveillance impractical.

#### [Why did the Tor Project decide to develop this browser for Mullvad VPN?](#mullvad-browser_why-tor-project-develop-this-browser)

Mullvad Browser fills a gap in the market for those who want to run a privacy-focused browser as good as Tor Browser but with a trusted VPN instead of the Tor Network.
This partnership contributes to providing people with more free privacy options for web browsing while challenging the current business model of exploiting people's data.
It demonstrates that it is possible to develop free technology solutions that prioritize the protection of user privacy.
Mullvad shares the same values around internet privacy and freedom and is dedicated to making privacy-enhancing technologies more widely available and rendering mass-surveillance impractical.

This joint project with Mullvad has contributed to addressing legacy code issues for Tor Browser and allowed the allocation of dedicated resources to make necessary improvements that benefit both Tor and Mullvad Browsers.
Over the last couple of years, the Tor Project has launched a number of [initiatives to increase adoption of our technologies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift) and made [significant improvements](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-advancing-privacy-innovation/) to the usability of our own products.

#### [Does this mean Tor Browser is going away?](#mullvad-browser_does-this-mean-tor-browser-going-away)

No, Tor Browser is here to stay.
We know that millions of users around the world rely on Tor Browser and other solutions that the Tor Project offers to safely connect to the internet, to browse anonymously online and to circumvent censorship.
Therefore Tor Browser will continue to exist.
There are a lot of reasons to continue to maintain and improve Tor Browser, it is still one of the few solutions that provides anonymity online because of its use of the Tor network.
This combination is a powerful one and sometimes one of the few options that censored and surveilled users have in their region to freely and safely access the internet.
This is also a free solution for all, making it an affordable solution for people at risk.

The development of Mullvad Browser will actually help make Tor Browser stronger because it allows us to continue to address legacy issues and code, and fix vulnerabilities.

We are also working hard on bringing Tor Browser for Android up to par with the desktop version's features.

The development of Mullvad Browser has helped us address legacy issues and code, and fix vulnerabilities.
It has not affected our attention and dedication to Tor Browser.

#### [Is Tor planning to enter the VPN space?](#mullvad-browser_is-tor-planning-a-vpn)

Two years ago we started a project to bring a VPN-like app that connects to the Tor network for Android users.
We know that many of the sites and services a user connects to via browser on desktop become an app when they are using the internet on mobile.
It is important for us to address this use case as the majority of people around the world only use a mobile device to connect to the internet, especially those in the Global South and at risk situations.
Offering a browser that connects to the internet with a trusted VPN as opposed to the Tor network is an important step in offering more alternatives when it comes to free privacy-focused browsers and can benefit Tor Browser in the future when our 'VPN-like' app has launched.

# Red Hat Virtualization Life Cycle

## Overview

Red Hat Virtualization is comprised of two operational components:

* Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHV-M), which provides a centralized management platform for a virtualized environment
* Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor (RHV-H), which provides the hypervisor for a cluster of virtual machines

Red Hat has offered support services for five years for each major release of Red Hat Virtualization. After 5 years of Production Support, Red Hat Virtualization support has 2 years of Extended Life Phase support, which is described later in this document.

This policy has been in effect for major releases and applies to the latest released minor version of the product. For example, when Red Hat Virtualization 4 was released in August, 2016, the version 4 series then became a fully supported major version of the product. When Red Hat Virtualization 4.4 was released in August, 2020, version 4.4 then became the fully supported product version with the earlier versions of 4.x still supported for production use, but no longer receiving back ports or feature enhancements.

Red Hat retains the right to evaluate and adjust the support policy, duration and terms of the Red Hat Virtualization product life cycle phases for any current or planned releases and versions of the product.

With the release of RHV 4.4 Red Hat continues to invest in and support customers with a production-ready virtualization portfolio. The latest addition to this portfolio is OpenShift with [OpenShift Virtualization](http://openshift.com/virtualization), which provides continuity and roadmap delivery for the KVM-based virtualization stack currently managed by RHV. Moving forward the RHV management feature set will be converged with OpenShift and OpenShift Virtualization providing customers with requirements for containers and VMs a migration path and a common platform for deploying and managing both.
## Details

Red Hat Virtualization Production Support services will be provided as per the [Scope of Coverage](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/scope_moredetail/) policies defined for Red Hat products.

The Red Hat Virtualization Product Support Life Cycle Phases are described here:

|  | Red Hat Product Life Cycle Phase Descriptions | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description | Full Support | Extended Update Support (for eligible versions)5 | Maintenance Support5 | Extended Life Phase Support |
| Access to previously released content through the Red Hat Customer Portal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Self Help through the Red Hat Customer Portal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Technical Support1 | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Limited and Upgrade assistance6 |
| Asynchronous Security Errata (RHSA) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Asynchronous Bug Fix Errata (RHBA)2 | Yes | Yes3 | Yes | No |
| Minor Releases | Yes | No | No | No |
| Refreshed Hardware Enhancements4 | Yes | No | Yes4 | No |
| Feature Backports, Enhancements | Yes | No3 | No | No |

1. Technical Support depends on the service level included in your Red Hat Virtualization subscription agreement.
2. Red Hat may choose, as an intermediate measure, to address serious issues that have an impact to customer business with a hotfix, while a Red Hat Bug Fix Advisory is created and verified.
3. While in EUS phase, feature and/or bug backports might be provided at the discretion of Red Hat.
4. Native Hardware Enablement (in Full Support phase) is provided by backporting hardware drivers, etc., to the relevant version of the Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor. During the Maintenance Phase, it is limited to hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes.
5. EUS / Maintenance Support is only for the Hypervisor (RHV-H). The customer needs to use the latest version of the Manager (RHV-M) to get support.
6. Check below to learn how the product is supported during the [Extended Life Phase](#elp).

## Life Cycle Dates

The Red Hat Virtualization Product Support Life Cycle dates are described here:

**Note:** EUS is available for all customers for all EUS Supported versions (4.2 and 4.3).

## Red Hat Virtualization Life Cycle

### Full Support Phase:

During the Full Support Phase, qualified [Critical and Important Security Advisories](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/updates/classification/) (RHSAs) will be released as they become available. Urgent and selected High Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available; all other available fix and qualified patches may be released via periodic updates.

If available, new or improved hardware enablement, may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat and are generally provided in minor releases. Hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided independently from minor releases at Red Hat’s discretion.

For any minor release made available during this phase, the available and qualified errata advisories (RHSAs, RHBAs, and RHEAs) will be cumulatively included with the contents of previously released product updates. This means that if a customer is running an older version of the product and reports a bug, that bug will be fixed in the latest version of the software and a customer may need to upgrade in order to take advantage of that fix.

### Extended Update Support:

Beginning with Red Hat Virtualization 4.2, Red Hat provides Extended Update Support (EUS) which provides customers an added 1 year of support, for the minor version they are running. For example, customers running version 4.2 will continue to have access to fixes for a full 2 years, even with the release of version 4.3.

**Note:**

* EUS is available for select Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 and higher versions only.
* EUS is available only for the Hypervisor (RHV-H) and not for the Manager (RHV-M).
* EUS is not available for IBM Power architecture.
* EUS feature backports are provided at the discretion of Red Hat.

### Maintenance Support Phase:

During the Maintenance Support Phase, qualified [Critical and Important Security Security Advisories](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/updates/classification/) (RHSAs) will be released as they become available. Urgent and Selected High Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) may be released as they become available. Other Bug Fix (and Enhancement (RHEA) Advisories may be released at Red Hat’s discretion, but should not be expected.

If available, hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat, generally in minor releases. New software functionality is not available during this phase.

New features or enhancements will not be provided.

### Extended Life Phase (ELP):

During the Extended Life Phase, a Red Hat Virtualization Manager subscription provides continued access to previously released content on the Red Hat Customer Portal, as well as other content such as documentation and the Red Hat Knowledgebase.

For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only. Advice for migrating to currently supported Red Hat Virtualization versions may also be provided.

Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the Extended Life Phase for a particular version of Red Hat Virtualization at any time.

**Note:** Support for Extended Life Phase is provided only for the latest minor release of the product (example 4.1.z where z stands for the latest version).

### Upgrade Policy for Major Releases:

Red Hat will provide a supported upgrade path between major releases for Red Hat Virtualization Manager. Upgrades will be supported between the latest minor release of previous version to the most current version of the next higher major release. In these cases, the upgrade process will be limited to support upgrading from the latest minor release of the previous version to the new major version.

For Example:

* Upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6.11 to Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 is supported, with 3.6.11 being the most current release of the 3 Series of minor releases.
* Upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.5 to Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 is not supported. In order to achieve this upgrade, the customer should first upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6.11, before the upgrade to Red Hat Virtualization 4.0.

Upgrade from Beta / Pre-release or Upstream releases to a fully supported release is not supported.

### Upgrade Policy for Minor Releases:

Customers are expected to update to new minor and z-stream releases as and when they become available. Accelerated fixes will not be provided for issues that have been previously fixed in a subsequent release; customers are expected and encouraged to keep their systems current and upgraded to the latest version of product to keep up to date on all patches and fixes.

In circumstances where the reported issue is not fixed in the current shipping release, the customer is still expected to upgrade their systems to the latest release (n) or in some exceptional cases, the immediate previous release (n-1). This is to ensure that any fixes are developed and verified against the latest or the immediate previous release.

### Security Updates:

Throughout the support lifecycle, qualified security issues of Critical or Important impact, as well as select mission-critical bugs, will be addressed by updated packages. For more information on how the impact of security issues is assessed, please refer to [Issue Severity Classification](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification).

### Delivery of Red Hat Virtualization Advisories:

Software changes to Red Hat Virtualization are delivered through individual updates known as errata advisories. These advisories are delivered through the Red Hat Customer Portal or through other authorized portals. Errata advisories can be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated and distributed as a minor release.

Errata advisories may contain security fixes (Red Hat Security Advisories or RHSAs), bug fixes (Red Hat Bug Fix Advisories or RHBAs), or feature enhancements (Red Hat Enhancement Advisories or RHEAs). All errata advisories are tested and qualified against the respective, active Red Hat Virtualization major release. For example, a Red Hat Virtualization 4 RHSA will be applied cumulatively to the latest Red Hat Virtualization 4 version and patch set.

All released errata advisories remain accessible to active subscribers for the entire Red Hat Virtualization life cycle. Within each major release of Red Hat Virtualization any errata advisory (including one released as part of a minor release) will be applied cumulatively to the latest release of Red Hat Virtualization, including any patch sets for advisories released after the version currently used by the customer.

Red Hat actively develops only the last major version’s minor release (for example a bug found in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6 or Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 after the release of Red Hat Virtualization 4.1 could only be fixed in an errata to a 4.1.z release). Errata advisories or hotfixes for earlier releases are provided at the discretion of Red Hat to address critical impact security issues with a significant customer business impact.

During the life cycle of a major release Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain binary compatibility for the core runtime environment across all minor releases and errata advisories. If necessary, Red Hat may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for critical impact security issues or other significant issues.

## Red Hat Virtualization Manager Compatibility

Red Hat Virtualization uses the concept of Compatibility Level to describe the functionality and compatibility of the virtual environment.

Each minor version of Red Hat Virtualization delivers a new Compatibility Level based on the minor version number. Each release of Red Hat Virtualization Manager supports at least the current and previous minor release Compatibility Level.

The following table outlines the Data Center/Cluster Compatibility levels supported by Red Hat Virtualization Manager.

| Red Hat Virtualization Manager Compatibility Matrix | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RHV Release | Release Date | RHVH Supported Compatibility Levels |
| 2.1 | November 3rd, 2009 | 2.1 |
| 2.2 | June 23rd, 2010 | 2.2, 2.1 |
| 3.0 | January 18th, 2012 | 3.0, 2.2 |
| 3.1 | December 5th, 2012 | 3.1, 3.0 |
| 3.2 | June 11th, 2013 | 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 |
| 3.3 | January 21st, 2014 | 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 |
| 3.4 | June 16th, 2014 | 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 |
| 3.5 | Februrary 11th, 2015 | 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 |
| 3.6 | March 9th, 2016 | 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 |
| 4.0 | August, 2016 | 4.0, 3.6 |
| 4.1 | April 18th, 2017 | 4.1, 4.0, 3.6 |
| 4.2 | May 15th, 2018 | 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 3.6 |
| 4.3 | May 8th, 2019 | 4.3, 4.2, 4.1 |
| 4.4 | August 4th, 2020 | 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, 4.4, 4.3, 4.2 |

- Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHV-M) needs to have a cluster with a cluster level that is not higher than the oldest RHV-H host version in the cluster.
## Red Hat Virtualization Tested Configurations

Red Hat highly recommends the use of tested configurations. The Package Manifest, accessible in the documentation section of the Red Hat customer portal, contains a list of tested packages. We highly recommend that production Red Hat Virtualization environments use tested configurations unless otherwise advised by Red Hat Support.

## Red Hat Hypervisor Upgrade and Support Policy

Red Hat will provide a supported upgrade path for all hypervisors within the same major release. Upgrading hypervisors from one major release to another major release is not supported. Red Hat will attempt to provide migration paths between major releases at its discretion.

The following table outlines the compatibility levels supported by the Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and by the corresponding Red Hat Enterprise Linux release with the appropriate management agent installed.

| Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor | Red Hat Enterprise Linux Release | Supported RHVH Compatibility Levels |

# Security Bulletin: IBM DS8870 Release 7.2 is affected by an additional vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL which have an impact on the IBM Power Servers incorporated in the IBM DS8870. While another IBM security bulletin addresses this vulnerability in these IBM Power servers generally (https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020034), this bulletin addresses this vulnerability in the specific context of these servers’ use in the DS8870. (This bulletin addresses a vulnerability that is separate and distinct from the DS8870 OpenSSL vulnerability security bulletin published at https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1004582.)

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.

CVSS Base Score: 5

## Affected Products and Versions

DS8870 Release 7.2

## Remediation/Fixes

This vulnerability is fixed in DS8870 Release 7.3. Please contact your IBM representative to order and install DS8870 Release 7.3.

IBM currently plans to make a fix available for this vulnerability in DS8870 Release 7.2 in a service release scheduled for late June. This bulletin will be updated when this is available.

Although IBM suggests you install a fix for this vulnerability, you can consider the mitigations identified below in determining when and how to implement these fixes in your particular environment.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The following steps can help mitigate, but not eliminate the risks of this vulnerability:   Ensure that the DS8870 HMC is installed behind a firewall that limits access to the HMC ports.

Ensure that access to the DS8870 HMC is only by trusted personnel.

Ensure that no Flexible Service Processor (FSP) ports on the Power servers in the DS8870 are connected to a reachable network (this is the standard and recommended DS8870 configuration).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-04-07 05:56:04 UTC  ``` A missing bounds check was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS heartbeart extension packets. This flaw could be used to reveal up to 64k of memory from a connected client or server.  Only 1.0.1 releases of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1f (and 1.0.2 betas)  The following upstream commit introduced TLS/DTLS heatbeat support and also this issue:  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=4817504>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c1)  Huzaifa S.

These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as my install media?  I understand that the OpenSSL that was on the install media for 6.4 is NOT vulnerable and that the OpenSSL that is on the install media for 6.5 IS vulnerable.  But, once a 6.4 is patched does it not get ALL of the RHEL 6 updates?  According to the link provided:  "Updated openssl packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6."  and the packages listed (I'm only including the SRPM for brevity):  "openssl-1.0.1e-15.el6.src.rpm File outdated by:  RHSA-2014:0376"   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c44)  Shabba    2014-04-10 14:23:03 UTC  ``` If you installed 6.4 and then ran updates to update it to 6.5, then you were running 6.5, and OpenSSL 1.0.1, from that point forward.

I just want it to be made clear whether or not installing RHEL 6 via RHEL 6.4 install media and then doing the typical "yum update" leaves you in an invulnerable state.  I am also not trying to verify that MY systems are vulnerable as I do not administer any RHEL systems at this time.  I am trying to verfy that when someone else tells me they are not vulnerable because they installed RHEL 6.4 that I can trust that statement.  The problem is increased if the openssl package is not updated because the normal vefification of a CVE patch (rpm -qa --changelog | grep CVE-YYYY-NNNN) would show them as vulnerable (since it would return nothing) as opposed to patched.   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c46)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-10 15:03:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Forrest Tiffany from [comment #43](show_bug.cgi?id=1084875#c43)) > These two statements are contradictory.  Do the updates to RHEL 6 not get > installed if I used RHEL 6.4 as my install media vs later using RHEL 6.5 as > my install media?  If you installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 from 6.4 media and installed all updates since then, you already installed all updates that were released as part of 6.5 minor release.  If you install openssl update RHBA-2013:1585 (or any subsequent openssl update), you updated to affected version regardless of what media you originally installed from.  Use 'rpm -q openssl' to see what version you currently have installed.  The confusion may be related to the fact that there is a support / update stream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 that does not include 6.5 updates.  That has openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2 as the latest released version.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

# Security Bulletin: DS8870 Release 7.2 is affected by a vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 and CVE-2014-0076)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (ie. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library.

CVSS Base Score: 5

## Affected Products and Versions

DS8870 Release 7.2

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM strongly suggests that you install the vulnerability fix identified immediately below

| *Product* | *VRMF* | *APAR* | *Remediation/First Fix* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DS8870 | ICS\_CVE\_2014-0160\_v1.0 | N/A | 04/28/2014 |

Please contact your IBM representative to order and install the ICS CD.

After applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160

1) SSL Certificates

The installation regenerates the SSL certificates and no customer actions are required.
2) Reset User Credentials

Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The following steps can help mitigate, but not eliminate the risks of this vulnerability:

 Ensure that the DS8000 HMC is installed behind a firewall that limits access to the ports.

 Customers that do not require the CIM interface should stop the CIM Agent.
  To stop the CIM Agent using the Web User Interface on the Hardware Master Console (HMC).

## Minimize business risk across the entire SDLC

Every business is a software business. Whether you’re selling it directly to your customers or relying on it to run your operations, Black Duck helps you protect your bottom line by building trust in your software—at the speed your business demands.

![<p>Your software is assembled as well as created. It includes more than open source and proprietary code. To build software users can trust, you must address the security of everything that goes into it.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576_1272199214.coreimg.svg/1725661318771/sig-secure.svg "Secure your software supply chain")

## Secure your software supply chain

Building applications that users can trust requires securing everything that goes into it. Comply with supply chain requirements through comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management and eliminate risks throughout the application development life cycle.

**[Protect every aspect of your software](/solutions/software-supply-chain-security.html)**

![<p>Transforming your business through software requires speed and agility. Orchestrating and correlating your tests ensures that security doesn’t slow you down, even across multiple tools and vendors.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576.coreimg.svg/1725661338119/sig-achieve.svg "Build security into DevOps")

## Build security into DevOps

Transforming your business through software requires speed and agility. Maintain productivity with easy, developer-friendly solutions integrated and optimized for the needs of DevSecOps.

**[Deliver secure, high-quality code faster](/solutions/devsecops.html)**

![<p>Secure software requires more than just tools. You need to align your people, processes, and technology to address security risks based on your organization’s unique policies and business objectives.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576_663562323.coreimg.svg/1725661358397/sig-build.svg "Manage AppSec risk at enterprise scale")

## Manage AppSec risk at enterprise scale

Managing risk at scale requires you to rein in tool sprawl and centralize policies and reporting to enable a single view of risk. Shift application security everywhere so you can improve your risk posture and your AppSec program’s total cost of ownership.

[**Simplify your AppSec program**](/solutions/enterprise-application-security-risk-management.html)

## Address risk based on your role

Security can’t be a solo act. From developers to CISOs and everyone in between, security is a team effort best achieved by clear roles and responsibilities, and defined outcomes.

# MRI Rubies may contain statically linked, vulnerable OpenSSL

```
<https://gist.github.com/chapmajs/10473815>

Apparently some MRI build scripts copy only the OpenSSL version at time of build, so the provided test is not
necessarily 100% accurate. PoC confirmed with RVM on OS X 10.9, Arch Linux, Slackware 14.1

# OpenSSL bug CVE-2014-0160

by arma | April 7, 2014

![](../static/images/lead.png)

A new OpenSSL vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which [can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2014-0160).

If you're using an older OpenSSL version, you're safe.

Note that this bug affects way more programs than just Tor â expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. If you need strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet, you might want to stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.

Here are our first thoughts on what Tor components are affected:

1. **Clients**: The browser part of Tor Browser shouldn't be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl. But the Tor client part is: Tor clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive information like "what sites you visited in this session" to your entry guards. If you're using TBB we'll have new bundles out shortly; if you're using your operating system's Tor package you should get a new OpenSSL package and then be sure to manually restart your Tor. [update: the bundles are out, and you should upgrade]
2. **Relays and bridges**: Tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. An attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that you're at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). An attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your IP address can impersonate your relay (but remember that Tor's [multi-hop design](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement) means that attacking just one relay in the client's path is not very useful). In any case, best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys. (You will need to update your MyFamily torrc lines if you run multiple relays.) [update: we've [cut the vulnerable relays out of the network](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004362.html)]
3. **Hidden services**: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. Like the [last big OpenSSL bug](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mean-tor-clients%3F), this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service [edit: if it's your entry guard that extracted your key, they know where they got it from]. Also, an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. Best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.
4. **Directory authorities**: In addition to the keys listed in the "relays and bridges" section above, Tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. Once you've updated your OpenSSL package, you should generate a new signing key. Long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). More tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please don't rotate that yet. We'll see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.
5. **Tails** is still tracking Debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.
6. **Orbot** looks vulnerable; they have some [new packages available for testing](https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003383.html).
7. The webservers in the <https://www.torproject.org/> rotation needed (and got) upgrades. Maybe we'll need to throw away our torproject SSL web cert and get a new one too.

### [We have been speculating if](#comment-55451)

We have been speculating if a tor relay couldn't be made to leak information about the IP address of the next hop in a circuit, since an arbitrary memory leak is possible. Then, in theory, one could walk all nodes in a circuit to eventually uncover the other end of the circuit... (if all nodes in the circuit are linked to vulnerable openssl). Is that somehow prevented by the implementation design?

Sounds doable in theory (no idea about practice, but we should assume so).

Arbitrary memory leaks are bad news.

Another fine reason to get relays to update (many of the big ones are in the process of updating right now).

### [Do heartbeat messages go](#comment-55455)

Do heartbeat messages go both ways? If so, can a relay also theoretically read a tor client process's memory?

Is Tor working on removing <http://opensslfoundation.com/> as a dependency yet? It seems riddled with bugdoors. Personally, I'd like to avoid using software from Maryland.

Removing the openssl dependency, and replacing it with what? The world is missing an actually good crypto library.

By "chain" I assume you mean "Tor circuit".

In that case check out the comment at the top:

<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160#comment-55451>

And then imagine fetching the memory from the relay that turns out to be Alice's entry guard, and also fetching it from the relay that turns out to be Alice's exit relay.

So the "entire chain" isn't needed. Maybe.

Entry guards or exits could use different crypto than other relays. Would you consider having exits use lighter weight encryption to ease the load on their CPUs?

### ["Replacing it with](#comment-55527)

"Replacing it with what?".

Isn't OpenSSL somewhat bloated? Tor does not need the many ciphers and operation-modes implemented in OpenSSL. Tor could operate just fine using a single cipher and mode of operation. That can be implemented without the baggage of a huge crypto library.

### [Yes, OpenSSL is a massive](#comment-55556)

Yes, OpenSSL is a massive library. with several cipher suites. The protocol has seen many years of (from time to time, shaky) service with a huge install base.

The benefits of keeping the same code versus rewriting are well known. I don't like OpenSSL, and would love to see it fixed in so many ways. Better test suites, static analysis, real verification, additional cipher suites, fixes to the protocol design all spring to mind; some of these cannot be done in a backwards-compatible way. It can be rescued, it's just a herculean effort.

Having lots of ciphers is very useful, for instance, when BEAST, CRIME, etc. came along and exploited padding oracles that were only present in block ciphers, servers could switch to RC4. When RC4 was shown to be broken, but the previously mentioned attacks were fixed, we could switch back. This flexibility is crucial in being able to respond quickly to new attacks, and in providing a smooth migration path for users.

So in practice, what does this mean for Tor? Could an adversary like the NSA completely unmask the entire Tor network without anyone knowing, or could they unmask a user that connects to a compromised or honeypot website?

This is quite scary...

Completely unmask the entire Tor network? Not anymore, since many relays have upgraded. But before the vulnerability was announced? Who knows.

A compromised website won't be a good place to launch an attack, since the Tor Browser shouldn't be affected by the bug, and the website doesn't interact with the Tor client at the link encryption layer.

But an entry guard (the first Tor relay you connect to) can potentially read client-side memory. See the 'clients' section above.

So if I had done something "bad" in the past before the CVE was out, how much should I worry? By "bad" I mean things on the level of drug dealing, child porn, dissidence from nasty countries, etc. (not that I actually \_do\_ those specific things, but hypothetically if I did something on that level). Should I toss all my online pseudonyms out the window? I'm not quite sure what \_practical\_ steps I should take to ensure my safety.

By "bad" I mean things on the level of drug dealing, child porn, dissidence from nasty countries, etc.

If you deal in drugs, you should pack your bags immediately and head for Mexico, Colombia or Honduras. You will find sanctuary there with like-minded people.

If you indulge in child porn, you should head for Russia. I heard some of Putin's men are child porners.

If you are a political dissident, you are safe. NSA and GCHQ will never uncover your activities or reveal your identity to North Korea, Iran, China, Turkey, Pakistan, etc.

### ["If you deal in drugs, you](#comment-55761)

"If you deal in drugs, you should pack your bags immediately and head for Mexico, Colombia or Honduras. You will find sanctuary there with like-minded people." -

Well not necessarily, Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, and some other countries produce huge quantities of drugs, but the drugs are not for them, but for the worldwide drug-hungry-consumer countries like US and EU's. In fact, US is the winner on this subject, It's the greatest drug consumer in the world.

"if you are a political dissident, you are safe. NSA and GCHQ will never uncover your activities or reveal your identity to North Korea, Iran, China, Turkey, Pakistan, etc."

Well Not necessarily, if you are a politically dissident towards US policy, or a journalist, who have profound commitment with US constitution's freedom statements and Law, who also look for the truth and nothing but the truth on what's going on with US government's illegal activities perpetrated against American's citizens and other countries's government that are not fond of with US policy. then you might be careful, they may well say you are a whistleblower, and persecute you around the world. even though your duty and responsability you know will always be to release to public opinion those offensive government activities, Hence, you may be in serious trouble specially if living in US soil.

So, feel free to use a program called advor if you find one on the internet, if you really want to, but know that it's not endorsed or checked or anything by the Tor people.

Various web services embed Google's captchas before they let you use their service.

I observed many times that after solving the captcha the SSL connection to Google on port 443 remains open for a long time.

This could be 30 minutes or longer.

Would it make sense regarding the heartbeat bug that Google keeps those connections open to read parts of the memory of connected Tor clients on a large scale?

Running a vpn-server on the inside-IP of your -second- router with Gargoyle or openwrt on it, would protect you against any vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS. Don't use Tor or surf the web without it. Configuration of the vpn server/client is quite simple on Gargoyle.

### [Wait, what? No, using a vpn](#comment-55542)

Wait, what? No, using a vpn would not protect you from "any vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS". For example, if you go to an https website with your browser, and it goes through your vpn, and there's a vulnerability in your browser's SSL library, the vpn does not help you.

For another example, if you use Pidgin to talk to an xmpp server over ssl, and it goes through your vpn, a vulnerability in openssl (like the one in this post) will be bad news for you.

It's about what applications you use, not about how you transport your traffic. Notice that that statement is true in the same way for Tor itself.

And no, you are mistaken that the entry guard gets to see data for the exit relay. The Tor client does, but that's the one that you run under your own control so it's ok that it does. (Otherwise there would be a point in the network that gets to both see you and learn where you're going, which is exactly what Tor's decentralized design aims to avoid.)

the rest I don't know beacause of network timeout or something.

I did not check for rekeying.

To test for yourself, do this:

### [Yep. I think it's more like](#comment-55536)

Yep. I think it's more like 1000 relays vulnerable at this point.

But counting relays is the wrong way to assess the vulnerability of the Tor network as a whole. You should ask what fraction of total consensus weight, or what fraction of advertised descriptor bandwidth, is vulnerable.

Otherwise you fall into the trap of various past researchers who see 500 relays on Windows, claim Windows is vulnerable, and conclude they can compromise 10% of the Tor network. This is true except that 10% of the Tor network doesn't see 10% of the users or traffic.

Now, in this case a big fraction of the network by weight \*is\* vulnerable. I mailed the top 400 relay operators last night to tell them about the bug. You can also follow along the tor-relays list:

[https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/thread.htmâ¦](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/thread.html#4230)

Eventually we'll start taking away the Valid flag from fingerprints of relays who were known to be running with a vulnerable openssl.

It's going to be a bumpy couple of days / weeks.

### [OpenSSL is a library which](#comment-55555)

OpenSSL is a library which many programs and websites (including but not limited to tor) use to do cryptography.

A critical security vulnerability was found in this library yesterday. Just about everyone who uses tor (and the whole Internet, in fact, not just tor) is affected in some way.

What needs to be done is for an updated Tor Browser Bundle (coming soon) to be released, and for all users to upgrade. The relay operators also need to update their relays, and generate new keys for them.

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot more a user can do than that. Nobody knows if anyone has actually been attacked using this vulnerability, and even if they were, it would be basically impossible to find out. That's why everyone is scrambling today.

Two or three of the nine directory authorities were unaffected, and the rest were vulnerable.

The long-term authority identity keys are unaffected, since they're kept offline.

The medium-term authority signing keys were affected, and they've been rotated (except for two authorities, which are offline until they can be brought back safely). Rotating them makes things a lot better, but still not perfect.

And the relay identity keys might have been taken, but really that's more of a hassle than a security thing -- if we rotate them, existing clients will scream in their logs that they're being mitm'ed, and more importantly existing clients will refuse to proceed, even though the directory documents they fetch are signed with other keys.

It's not clear to me yet that this change is worth a flag day. Hopefully we can do it more smoothly.

The bug does not allow your computer to be directly compromised or identified? It can alow people to see what data is going backwards and forwards though. It can alow the first computer in TOR to see what other websites you have visited in this session and what cookies you have?

So if you follow tor's advice and never enter personally-identifying information, you are still safe, it is not like the big last problem then?

### [It can allow the first relay](#comment-55591)

It can allow the first relay in your Tor circuit to see what other websites you have visited in this session, yes. That's because your Tor client might keep past destinations (e.g. websites you visited) in memory, and this bug allows the SSL server (in this case, the first relay in your Tor circuit) to basically paw through your Tor client's memory.

If you visit https websites using your browser, though, your Tor client will never have your web cookies in its memory, because they would be encrypted -- just as the exit relay can't see them because they're encrypted, so also your Tor client can't see them because they're encrypted:

[https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/articles/circumvention-featuresâ¦](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/articles/circumvention-features.html#7)

<https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https>

The Tor Browser, which is based on Firefox, is not affected. But your Tor client, which is the program called Tor that comes in the Tor Browser Bundle and that your Tor Browser proxies its traffic into, is affected.

I'm sorry this is complicated. If the above doesn't make sense, a little box on a blog comment isn't going to fix it for you. I recommend starting at

You can think of the Tor client like your VPN provider. Or if that metaphor doesn't make sense, think of it like your network.

For example, when you're sitting at Starbucks just using the Internet directly, people next to you get to see your network traffic and learn things about what you do -- if you only go to https sites then they learn which sites you go to but not what you send since it's encrypted. And if you go to an http site then they learn not only where you went but also what you said.

The Tor client sees exactly this same information.

Or if that metaphor didn't make sense, but you know about the Tor exit relay issue: the Tor client gets to see everything that all your exit relays get to see.

Another out of bounds and pointer's arithmetic bug... shouldn't we just walk away from C and C++? These two languages make it simply too easy to make bad mistakes like these... i am quite sure that by just dropping it we could improve a lot our security. It is simply too hard for a human being to make correct programs with such languages.

Also... C was a good idea back in the 70ies... but with the hardware of today it makes little sense to use it (if not for OSes)... it doesn't even support multi-core processors natively (you need an external library to use threads, it is heavy and memory-hungry and the language itself has no safe native way for inter-process communication).

Most applications of today, Tor included, could be written in a modern language, without pointer arithmetics (which is useless) and with a garbage collector which frees the developer from having to remember to allocate or free memory areas. What about Google-Go for instance? It is fast, it is made to make it easy to write error-free software, it supports natively multi-core and multi-thread programming in a lightweight way, it supports natively interprocess-communication, it doesn't need pointer's arithmetics and it has a garbage collector...

Really, it is time to evolve. Especially if we care about security.

You are jumping to conclusions, because in the background behind your magic vm curtain everything behaves like before, and there memory and addresses and "pointers" are the fabric every programm runs on.

With VMs - that actually jitcompile your bytecode into native - you are just relaying your dependence on layers of layers of lay..., however if your bottom layer has a vulnerability your programm might be untouched however, the outcome isn't different.

A vm is just a layer and if one layer breaks your program is broken,

replace layer by sandbox.

What is really needed is a best practice "book", about code examples being vulnerable and how to do things better.

### [You are wrong. I am not](#comment-55660)

You are wrong. I am not jumping at anything.

I have several decades of experience in programming, in more languages that i can remember, and i perfectly know what i am saying.

And no. No "best practice book" or experience, no matter how long that is, can help you in this. This is the usual excuse that C and C++ fanboys throw at you whenever you tell them the pure and simple truth: the only thing that DOES help is a language that simply stops you from doing stupid things and that takes care of things such as memory management that are better left to the machine itself.

Please also note that who works on complex projects such as openssl are usually very experienced programmers with a huge background in security and "best practices"... they try their best to avoid bugs... yet they DO mistakes as this (very serious) bug proves. Probably now you see my point. No matter how many books you read. No matter how much experience you read. You will do mistakes. More so if the language seems to be DESIGNED to work against the developer itself.

And yes, in the bottom of every VM there is low level code. So what? I did not state that this solution would be perfect... i said that it would be BETTER.

In few words... it is much harder to find and exploit bugs in a VM (which, in time, gets better and better) than find and exploit bugs in several thousands (or even millions) lines of code in every software ever made because... well... you are human... and humans do mistakes. Humans forget things such as freeing a block of allocated memory, machines don't. Humans make math mistakes such as accessing an index outside an array of bytes, machines don't. Humans forget to free resources such as open files, machines don't. In simple words... Machines are just better than Humans at certain tasks... so we should just let them do it in our place. And unfortunately C and C++ fail at this.

We cannot completely avoid bugs, it is in our nature to make mistakes, but we can make the surface for a possible attack smaller. My proposal is exactly this: make the attack-surface smaller by using better, newer languages that make it easy to write better software and make it harder to make disastrous bugs.

### [I have updated to the newest](#comment-55656)

I have updated to the newest TBB and when I go to <https://www.howsmyssl.com/> It tells me that my browser is still vulnerable. That's due to the use of TLS 1.0 by Firefox 24.4. Does this affect Browsing through Tor in any shape or form?

FF is capable of using TLS 1.2 but it's not enabled in FF 24 or even 26 as far as I know. I can fix this by modifying security.tls.version.max to 3 and security.tls.version.min to 1 in about:config . Would this modification single me out among other Tor users in any shape or form?

Thanks.

For the benefit of those who are not computer savvy, could you outline in greater detail on how to make those modifications to FF 24 and FF 26?

**And what do Tor developers have to say about FF 24.4 using the very old version of TLS 1.0 instead of 1.2?** Let us hear what they (through arma, probably) have to say.

- type about:config in the URL bar, then click on "I'll be careful I promise"

- search for "security.tls.version.max", double-click on it and change the number from 1 to 3

- (optional) search for "security.tls.version.min", double-click on it and change from 0 to 1 or 2

- search for "security.ssl3.rsa\_fips\_des\_ede3\_sha" just double-click on it, it will set it to "false"

- search for "security.enable\_tls\_session\_tickets", double-click on it, it will set it to "true".

(thanks to <https://blog.dbrgn.ch/2014/1/8/improving_firefox_ssl_tls_security/> and <https://blog.samwhited.com/2014/01/fixing-tls-in-firefox/>)

You may have to re-start Tor browser to make sure the changes were effective.

You can now re-test <https://www.howsmyssl.com/>, it should now be on "probably okay".

Note : SamWhited says that these settings were disabled by default because "firefox is vulnerable to downgrade attacks", I definetly don't know which one is better.

Note2 : you may want to check your browser fingerprint on <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> before and after the changes. For me it was OK.

### [Are you really, absolutely](#comment-55724)

Are you really, absolutely positively sure of that ?

Yes, technically it may be true that the memory, which is used to send the (dummy) "heartbeat" data, belongs to the Tor client process; - at the moment that data is being sent - ;

but if the Tor client had to request (allocate) the ~ 64k bytes block of memory from the OS, that particular block of physical mem might happen to come from anywhere (depending on OS and unpredictable conditions) and still hold data which formerly belonged to other processes, system's or users'. Or does the OS zero out a block of memory it handles in response to a process's requests ? Surely not your vanilla OS, including MS Windows !

Assuming Tor requests a 64 k block for the stated uninitialised "heartbeat" operation, does it then release, or keep the same block for use in other heartbeat (or other) circumstances ? If the block is allocated once and for all, ot would mitigate the vulnerability as an attacker could not dig in the client's memory again and again by repeating the attack. OTOH if the block is released and a new block be allocated each time, then it's the worst possible scenario, depnding on precise OS kernel's way of satisfying memory requests, a large part of the system's physical memory contents might be grabbed by an persistent attacker.

Opinions, please ?

### [I had a similar train of](#comment-55834)

I had a similar train of thought and I think this is the most important question on this page.

Many people are using Tor for online research and making notes while browsing. Their text may be stored encrypted on the hard disk but in memory it is clear text. In addition an auto save feature of the word processors or text editor may put multiple versions of the clear text in dynamically allocated memory locations.

Say such a person downloads a video while writing and during this download every few seconds OpenSSL happily sends 64KB chunks of memory into the internet.

I would like to see a table with the threat potential for memory disclosures for the prevalent Windows OS from XP to 8.1 for administrator and user sessions as well as for Linux, if necessary with a differentation for 32bit and 64bit systems.

### [The problem is that OpenSSL](#comment-56817)

The problem is that OpenSSL has its own memory management, it does not use the memory management from the OS. It has been a known bug for I think 5 years that disabling the OpenSSL internal memory management when compiling results in a non-functional version of OpenSSL, because of all the memory handing bugs that exist in the OpenSSL code. This is why the OpenBSD folks are forking the code base and attacking it with chain saws, in order to get it down to a code base that they can audit and fix to their satisfaction.

### [Yes, a given relay operator](#comment-55684)

Yes, a given relay operator can see whatever his relay can see. That's why Tor circuits are multiple hops, and no single relay gets to know both the client and also her destination.

<https://www.torproject.org/about/overview>

But if you can break into many relays, your odds go up of running across both the first hop in the user's path and also the last hop.

It would be pretty cool to have a design where the relay can't know anybody about the connections it's handling. But that solution would need to include somebody watching the traffic flows into / out of the relay, which has nothing to do with Tor process memory.

### [The counters for this is](#comment-56065)

The counters for this is obvious:

1: Always run Torbrowser from a newly-extracted, never-used directory or from a copy of that in a directory on a tmpfs in RAM.

2: When it really counts, do not log into anything or engage in any activity that would identify you. Boot, do your secure work, then shut down.

3: Any time security forces could be a danger, use Tor from public wifi hotspots, using that hotspot for nothing else. Use it at home only to avoid things like building up an unwanted Google search history.

This way, heartbleed and any similar attacks all fail. They get an empty history and the IP address of a public wifi hotspot, after working like hell to get it. Just like running a brute-force encryption cracking program for three months, only to find another encrypted tarball as the only contents...

3. Extract Tor Browser Bundle to: c:\

4. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\tor.exe to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

5. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\libeay32.dll to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

6. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\libevent-2-0-5.dll to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

7. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\libssp-0.dll to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

8. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\ssleay32.dll to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

9. Copy: C:\Tor Browser\Tor\zlib1.dll to c:\TorChat\bin\Tor\

10. Start TorChat: c:\TorChat\bin\torchat.exe

Remember TC is a hidden service and like mentioned in the post above you should update Tor and then switch IDs.

Somebody should indeed go through openssl and figure out all of its 'features' like this one. So far as I can tell, Tor doesn't need this heartbeat thing -- the Tor protocol has its own heartbeats built in.

The other question for each one will be whether an external observer can use any of the features we take out to distinguish us from 'real' SSL handshakes -- that's a major way that governments like Iran have been blocking Tor via DPI over the years.

I'm guessing at this point that focusing on just the heartbeat feature is like closing the barn door after the horses are extinct. But there are bound to be more issues remaining in other parts of openssl.

You should give out a bounty if someone reports a deanonymizing bug in one of those libraries. I think about $1000-2000. This would be a nice reward without the need for shady dealings to sell such bug on the black market.

I think this is the only realistic approach to get enough people to actually look through the code.

That said, if anybody knows somebody who wants to fund Tor Browser bug bounties, we'd love to reconsider this plan.

ps i recon the dude that posted that he looks at "very bad" websites is into kiddy porn and i hope he's sweating waiting for the feds to to make a "hard entry" on his front door and take him to live in the big house with "bad bubba and the shower sisters"

### [If you're just using Tor as](#comment-55868)

If you're just using Tor as a client, and only using TBB, then moving to TBB 3.5.4 should be all you need to do for Tor.

(I say "for Tor" because if you logged into some website using https over the past few years, it's possible that the website was vulnerable, completely separate from what browser you used to reach it -- people could attack the website to extract whatever personal information you might have given it.)

OK, that's disgusting. Not him, you. Let me guess, you're from America, Canada, or the UK, right? Either way, most of the world does not jump to the conclusion that "I look at bad websites" = "I look at kiddie porn". It's people with your views who try to get Tor banned or censored, because they assume the only reason people use Tor is for "bad things". Please, don't make completely and utterly unfounded assumptions, to the point where you actually wish great suffering upon a person. Honestly, I find that more disturbing what you're doing than the slim chance that his version of "bad sites" is exactly the same as your view.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm really quite tired of this. Quite often I'm on various chats, or forums, and I mention I like anonymity and privacy, and the first thing people assume is drugs, kiddie porn, or terrorism, and refuse to help me, or just as you do, wish for pain and suffering.

How's this. I go on "bad sites". Do you hope I suffer now? Do you hope I'm terrified of being locked up for decades and raped? Well too bad for you, because the sites I go on that are o-so bad are websites about atheism.

Once we're all done with our moral panics, can we please show some compassion for others who are lumped into one category just because we live in a place where we might like things big brother doesn't approve of?

Right. I wonder what the question is actually about?

Tor uses PFS in its link encryption, and also the circuit handshake uses PFS.

Plus relays rotate their (medium-term) onion keys weekly:

No, because that remote Tor client still knows everything that a local Tor client would, and it would still be vulnerable to this same sort of attack (if you haven't upgraded).

Plus, if you use a remote Tor client you add yet another point in the network that gets to know both you and everything you do.

And if that's not enough, you're still going to be running whatever application (e.g. browser) on your own computer, so if it has problems then you didn't deal with that.

Bad idea IMO.

### [If you are using Tor, STOP](#comment-55910)

If you are using Tor, STOP NOW.

I suggest EVERYONE GO BACK TO 2.3.5.

Client and server. Clients, enable NoScript!

2.3.5 is back from 2011 and is tried and true, as far as I know.

Any hidden sites using compromised versions of Tor/SSL are unsafe and can never be considered safe again, unless the owner can prove through use of an old PGP key/.bit address that they own the new .onion site. All .onion sites using newer versions of Tor ARE POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED.

Also, any clients who have used a version of Tor within the last 2-3 years should be considering all of their keyrings potentially compromised by the entry guard (first relay) and should be completely re-encrypting their systems and generating new PGP keys, etc, as the first relay could have been reading our RAM through HeartBleed.

\* IF YOU CANNOT SAFELY THREATEN TO KILL POLITICIANS OR DOWNLOAD/POST CP, YOU ARE NOT ANONYMOUS. \*

I knew that it was sketchy when Tor Project was telling everyone to update their browser bundles after the Firefox javascript exploit that was revealing IP addresses of pedos.

THIS REQUIRES FURTHER RESEARCH AND THE TOR PROJECT IS COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF DOING IT, AS IT HAS BEEN OVERRUN BY NSA SHILLS. We need to go back and fork the project!

Be careful listening to this person's advice.

For example, the 2.x TBBs have old obsolete insecure versions of Firefox in them, so that part is clearly bad advice.

Hidden services that used insecure versions of openssl are indeed unsafe and shouldn't be used again -- I agree. But this notion of proving something via PGP? Not enough details. And why blame the newer versions of Tor? Haven't you looked at the code? Or at least the changelog that shows all the bugs we fixed since the version you prefer to run?

Ha, and then we get to the end of your comment. I guess I'll let people judge that one for themselves.

### [Part of the trouble is that](#comment-56331)

Part of the trouble is that Tor is an anonymity system, and our protocol is open and there are multiple implementations.

So there are no good ways of having the relays reach in and figure out what version the Tor client is.

I guess we could have the Tor client volunteer its version info, and then the relays can hang up if they don't like it. But if we're to do that, why not have the clients just opt to fail if they're out of date?

That sure would make some users upset, e.g. the ones who put Tor on their USB stick, go to the censored/surveilled place with really crappy Internet, and then can't use it because of the update that came out the day before -- even if all they planned to use it for was to fetch the newer version.

So in sum, "it's complicated; somebody should come up with a clear plan and then we can see if it would actually work. Most versions of such plans don't seem good."

### [Yes, the bug is fixed. But](#comment-56868)

Yes, the bug is fixed. But some of the fallout from the bug is still ongoing. For example, we'll be putting out a Tor update in the next while that blacklists the old (no longer in use) directory signing keys from the directory authorities -- not because we know they were compromised, but because we don't know they weren't. For another example, we cut 1000 relays out of the network because they were still vulnerable to the bug. And there are another 500-1000 that have upgraded (so the bug is fixed for them) but maybe their long-term identity key was extracted from them before they upgraded, and we'll be cutting those out of the network at some point.

It'll be a while yet until we can call it all resolved. I recommend following on the tor-relays list and other places than these blog comments.

# Sweet32: Birthday attacks on 64-bit block ciphers in TLS and OpenVPN

## CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6329

Cryptographic protocols
like [TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246), [SSH](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253), [IPsec](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/097.pdf),
and [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) commonly
use [block
cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, to
encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the
data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is
encrypted separately according to a [mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation).
Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and
Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, whereas AES uses a block size
of 128 bits.

It is well-known in the cryptographic community that a short block
size makes a block cipher vulnerable to
[birthday](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/modes.pdf)
[attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/623), even if there
are no cryptographic attacks against the block cipher itself.
We observe that such attacks have now become practical for the common usage of
64-bit block ciphers in popular protocols like TLS and OpenVPN.
Still, such ciphers are widely enabled on the Internet.
Blowfish is currently the default cipher in OpenVPN, and Triple-DES
is supported by nearly all HTTPS web servers, and currently used for
roughly 1-2% of HTTPS connections between mainstream browsers and
web servers.

We show that a network attacker who can monitor a long-lived
Triple-DES HTTPS connection between a web browser and a website can
recover secure HTTP cookies by capturing around 785 GB of
traffic. In our proof-of-concept demo, this attack currently takes
less than two days, using malicious Javascript to generate traffic. Keeping a web connection alive for two days may not
seem very practical, but it worked easily in the lab. In terms of computational complexity, this
attack is comparable to the recent [attacks](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/)
on [RC4](http://www.rc4nomore.com/). We also demonstrate
a similar attack on VPNs that use 64-bit ciphers, such as OpenVPN,
where long-lived Blowfish connections are the norm.

Countermeasures are currently being implemented by browser vendors,
OpenSSL, and the OpenVPN team, and we advise users to update to the
latest available versions.

Our results are described in the following technical paper, presented at [ACM CCS 2016](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2016/):

### [On the Practical (In-)Security of 64-bit Block Ciphers — Collision Attacks on HTTP over TLS and OpenVPN](SWEET32_CCS16.pdf)

Karthikeyan Bhargavan, GaÃ«tan Leurent

## Block Ciphers and the Birthday Bound

The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size *k*: the
best attack should be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity
2*k*. However, the block size *n* is also an important security
parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the
same key. This is particularly important when using common modes of
operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2*n*
queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM,
OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2*n*/2 blocks of message (the
birthday bound).

With a modern block cipher with 128-bit blocks such as AES, the
birthday bound corresponds to 256 EB.
However, for a block cipher with 64-bit
blocks, the birthday bound corresponds to only 32 GB, which is easily reached in practice. When the amount of data
encrypted under a fixed key approaches this limit, the security guarantees
of the mode of operation start to crumble. This problem is
well-known by cryptographers, who always require keys to be
changed **well before** 2n/2 blocks. However
it is often minimized by practitioners
because the attacks require known plaintext, and reveal only little
information.
Indeed, standard bodies only recommend to change the
key just before 2n/2 blocks, and many implementations don't
enforce any limit on the use of a key.

In particular, there are many uses of block ciphers with 64-bit blocks
where large amount of data are potentially encrypted under the same key, such as:

* 3G telephony (UMTS), encrypted with KASUMI;
* OpenVPN, which uses Blowfish as the default cipher;
* many Internet protocols, such as TLS, IPSec and SSH, support Triple-DES
  as a legacy cipher.

In all these scenarios, 32 GB of data can be transferred in less than one
hour with a fast connection.

## Exploiting Block Cipher Collisions

![](CBC.svg)

In practice, block ciphers are used with a mode of operation in order to
deal with messages of arbitrary length.
The CBC mode is one of the oldest encryption modes, and still widely
used. The message *M* is divided into blocks *mi* and is
encrypted as:
 *ci = Ek(mi ⊕ ci-1)*,
where *c-1* is an initialization
value usually denoted as IV.
We now explain the impact of collisions on the CBC mode.

CBC has been proven secure up to 2*n*/2 of
messages.
On the other hand there is a simple birthday attack against CBC: after
2*n*/2 message blocks encrypted with the same key (in the same
message or in different messages), a collision between two ciphertext
blocks *ci = cj* is expected. Since *Ek* is a
permutation, a collision in the output means that the inputs are the
same (*mi ⊕ ci-1 = mj ⊕ cj-1*)
which reveals the xor of two plaintext blocks:
*mi ⊕ mj = ci-1 ⊕ cj-1*.

With 2*d* blocks of data the expected number of collisions
is roughly 22*d-n-*1 (following the birthday paradox).

### Practical impact

In many contexts, recovering only the xor between
two plaintext blocks is not sufficient for an attack with a
practical impact. However, an attack can be mounted when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

* a fixed secret is sent repeatedly;
* some fraction of the plaintext is known.

In this case, there is a chance that a
collision leaks the xor between the fixed secret and the known
plaintext; this would immediately reveal the secret. More precisely,
this attack is expected to succeed with high probability as soon as
2s copies of the secret and 2t known blocks are encrypted,
with *s+t ≥ n*.

In particular, this is applicable to the security of encrypted HTTP
connections, when an authentication token is send with every request.
A man-in-the-browser attacker can generate a large
number of requests, and recover the authentication token, using the fact
that most headers in the request are predictable or even controlled by
the attacker.

## 64-bit Block Cipher Usage on the Internet

Many of the most influential Internet security protocols, such as TLS,
SSH, and IPsec were standardized at a time when 64-bit block ciphers,
such as Triple-DES and Blowfish, were still considered
strong.
For example, in TLS 1.0 and 1.1, Triple-DES is the mandatory encryption
algorithm, so all TLS libraries implement it and a vast majority of
web servers support it. In addition, until we disclosed the
attacks in this paper, OpenSSL included Triple-DES ciphersuites in its
HIGH-security list (it has now been moved to MEDIUM).

### Triple-DES and Blowfish usage in VPNs.

IPSec Most IPSec-based VPN clients support
Triple-DES for interoperability. In particular, some versions of
Microsoft's L2TP VPN client
use [Triple-DES
by default](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/325158).

OpenVPN
[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net) is a popular open-source VPN solution
originally written by James Yonan. The **default encryption** for the
transport protocol of OpenVPN **is Blowfish – a 64-bit cipher –** with the
CBC mode. OpenVPN supports two different modes to generate session keys
to encrypt the messages:

* In **pre-shared-key mode**, static keys are used for all the traffic.
  In particular, there is no limit to the lifetime of those keys.
* In **TLS mode**, session keys are generated with a TLS handshake,
  using certificates to authenticate the peers. The session keys are
  updated periodically, with limits on the number of packets, the number
  of bytes, or a session time. The default configuration rekeys the
  tunnel every hour.

### Triple-DES usage in HTTPS.

Triple-DES is the second most widely supported cipher (after AES) in HTTPS
servers, with about [87% of servers supporting
it](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2016/04/17/february-2016-scan-results-incomplete/).
Furthermore, all popular web browsers support Triple-DES. The cipher that
is actually negotiated for a TLS connection is chosen by the server,
based on its local preference order and on the order in which the
client advertises its ciphersuites. Since most modern browsers and servers
prefer AES over Triple-DES one may expect only a negligible number of connections
to negotiate Triple-DES. However, we find evidence that 1-2% of
all TLS connections likely use Triple-DES in CBC mode, as described below.

Firefox Telemetry
[Telemetry data from Mozilla Firefox](https://mzl.la/2bkLMFA)
show that Triple-DES is used for close to 1% of HTTPS connections from
Firefox browsers (0.76% with beta 49). The use of Triple-DES with Firefox
is slowly decreasing, and peaked with the removal of RC4 from
the list of supported ciphers in version 36. Indeed a number of servers
are configured to use, in order of preference, first RC4, then Triple-DES,
and now use Triple-DES with Firefox. Since all modern browsers have
deprecated RC4 between 2013 and 2015 (following
RFC 7465), they will also use
a Triple-DES ciphersuite in this situation.

Scanning the Top 1M Websites
We performed a scan of the top 1 million servers as listed by
Alexa using the [cipherscan](https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan)
tool. We
found that 86% of the servers that support TLS include Triple-DES as one
of the supported ciphers. Moreover, 1.2% of these servers are configured
in such a way that they will actually pick a
Triple-DES based ciphersuite with a modern browser, even though better alternatives are available.
(In particular many of these servers support AES-based ciphersuites, but use Triple-DES or RC4 preferentially.)

Windows XP Clients and Windows 2003 Servers
The Windows Server 2003 operating system does not support AES-based
ciphersuites in its default configuration, although support for AES can
be added with an optional [hotfix](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/948963). The Windows XP operating system with
security update [MS10-049](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/980436) supports
AES-based ciphersuites.
If AES-based ciphersuites have not been added, these operating systems support only
RC4, Triple-DES, DES, and RC2-40. While they are not supported
anymore by Microsoft, they still have some users, and this creates
situations where the best available cipher is Triple-DES.

### Long-lived HTTPS connection

An important requirement for the attack is to send a large number of
requests in the same TLS connection.
Therefore, we need to find client and
servers that not only negotiate the use of Triple-DES, but also exchange a
large number of HTTP request in the same TLS connection (without
rekeying). This is possible using a persistent HTTP connection, as
defined in HTTP/1.1 (Keep-Alive).
On the client side, all browsers
that we tested (Firefox, Chrome, Opera) will reuse a TLS connection as
long as the server keeps it open.

On the server side,
we found that a number of HTTP servers will close the TLS connection
even when it is still active. In particular, Apache and Nginx
limit the number of requests sent in the same connection, with a maximum
of 100 in the default configuration. On the other hand, IIS does not
seem to have such a limit. In practice, many high profile servers
accept a very large number of requests in a single TLS connection.

Vulnerable Websites
For a better estimate of the number of vulnerable servers, we tested
servers from Alexa's top 10k that negotiate Triple-DES with a modern
client. We identified 11483 different HTTPS servers, and found that 226 of them (1.9%) negotiate Triple-DES
with a modern client. Moreover, 72 of these (0.6% of the total) also
accept to keep a connection open for at least 800k requests.
Consequently, the duration of the attack is not unrealistic, at least
from the viewpoint of browsers and servers, and we estimate that at
least 0.6% of HTTPS connections are vulnerable to our attacks.

For advice about how to check a website's
configuration and configure it properly, see the [FAQ](#faq).

## Attacking Authenticated HTTP over TLS and OpenVPN

We now demonstrate concrete attacks against authenticated HTTP sessions even
when they are secured by TLS or OpenVPN.
First, we identify a few examples of secret authentication credentials
that are repeatedly sent by the browser on every request. We then
show how we can recover these secrets using block cipher collisions.

### HTTP Bearer Tokens

Cookie-based Sessions
Modern HTTPS websites use a variety of methods to manage authenticated
sessions with their clients. The most popular mechanism is secure
*cookies* as specified in RFC6265. Once a user has logged in, the
server sets a cookie containing a secret value on the user's
browser. The browser will then send the cookie on all subsequent
requests to the website, implicitly authenticating the user.

Cookies are sensitive, because an attacker who obtains a session cookie
can then log in as the user from a different browser. The cookie acts
as a *bearer token* that carries the user's delegated credential.

A cookie for a website is normally included in all requests to that
website whether that request was initiated by the user, or a script on
the website, or even by a different website. Browsers sometimes impose
stricter rules for this last category of requests, called cross-origin
or cross-domain requests. For example, XmlHttpRequests sent from one
domain to another may not have cookies attached. However, cross-domain
requests for images or iframes will still send cookies.

HTTP BasicAuth
Apart from cookies, there are other mechanisms for a website to
authenticate the user. In the HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism
specified in RFC7617, the browser asks the user to enter a username
and password into a special dialog and then sends this information (in
plaintext) as an HTTP header of the form:

```

Authorization: Basic dGVzdDoxMjPCow=

```

Once a user has entered his login information once, the browser will typically
cache this information and use it on all subsequent requests to the server.
Notably, even if a different website creates a cross-domain request to the
authenticated server, the BasicAuth credentials will be automatically sent
by the browser.
BasicAuth credentials contain the user's password and are hence security-critical.
One should only use this authentication mechanism over HTTPS but a number of
corporate websites use BasicAuth over HTTP, under the assumption that their
users can only access the website over a VPN or some other secure connection.

![](Attack.svg)
### The Beastly Attack Scenario

Our attack scenario, is similar to the setup used in recent attacks on RC4.
The attacker wants to steal some bearer token that is being repeatedly
sent by a browser to a website secured with HTTPS, or an HTTP website
accessed through a VPN. We assume that the attacker can
control some JavaScript on a web page loaded by the user's browser,
either by actively tampering with an HTTP response on the wire, or by
hosting a malicious website that the user is fooled into visiting. We
also assume that the attacker can observe all the encrypted traffic between the
target browser and the secure website.

We further assume that the data is encrypted with a 64-bit block cipher
in CBC mode (either an HTTPS connection where the client and server have
negotiated Triple-DES, or an HTTP connection though a VPN encrypted with Blowfish or Triple-DES). Suppose the victim is already logged in to a
website and has a session cookie. The attacker runs malicious
JavaScript code on the victim's browser that repeatedly sends HTTP
queries to the target website server, each containing the session
cookie. If he sends close to 232 queries, a collision is
expected between a ciphertext block corresponding to the cookie
(*ci*), and a known block (*cj*), containing a known part of the
query. The collision attack against CBC reveals the session cookie:
*pi = pj ⊕ ci-1 ⊕ cj-1*.

Note that most of the traffic generated by the attacker is known or
predictable. The requested URL is chosen by the attacker, and all the
headers excepted the cookie are predictable and can be observed in any
HTTP traffic.

```
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
    var W = new Array;
    for (var i=0; i<8; i++) {
        var x = new Worker("worker.js");
        W.push(x);
    }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

*attack.html*

```
var url = "https://10.0.0.1/index.html";
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest;

// Expand URL to ~4kB using a query string
// Alternatively, force a large cookie
url += "?";
var x = 10000000;
for (var i=0; i<=500; i++) {
    url += x++;
}

while(true) {
    xhr.open("HEAD", url, false);
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.send();
    xhr.abort();
}

```

*worker.js*

### Proof-of-Concept Attack Demo

The attacker code consists of two parts: a JavaScript program that
sends a large number of HTTP requests, and a network
adversary who processes the resulting ciphertext to recovers a 16-byte secret.

Man-in-the-browser code The attacker code is
shown on the right: it uses Web workers to
issue XmlHttpRequests, using
the withCredentials property to make sure that cookies are
send in the cross-origin request.
We experimented with several browsers, and we obtained the best
results with Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2.

Recovering collisions
We captured the encrypted packets with tcpdump and used a
C++ program to extract the ciphertext blocks (using libpcap).
In both the HTTPS attack and the OpenVPN attack, each HTTP query is sent in a
separate encrypted record, which contain the plaintext at a fixed
position, as well as some extra information (packet number, padding,
MAC, ...). Therefore, it is easy to know to which plaintext block
corresponds each ciphertext block, and to align the cookie to a block limit.
After capturing all the traffic, the C++ program sorts the ciphertext
blocks in order to locate collisions. Since the amount of data is quite
large (hundreds of gigabytes), we use the external sort implementation of the
stxxl library. With a NAS storage, sorting the data took
around four hours.

### Attacking Basic Auth over OpenVPN

To demonstrate the attack against OpenVPN, we use a pre-shared-key
tunnel between two physical machines running Linux, with Firefox
Developer Edition 47.0a2 on one side, and an nginx server on the other
side. Access to the server is protected by BasicAuth, and the user
has entered his credentials. Using the default OpenVPN settings, the
tunnel is encrypted with Blowfish in CBC mode.

We use the Javascript code described in the previous section to send a
large number of requests to the server though the tunnel. We found
that increasing the size of the request to 4~kB does not significantly
reduce the query rate, but reduces the number of queries required for
the attack. In our setting, the browser generates about 2900 requests
per second, using several web Worker running in parallel. We expect
the first collision after roughly
232.3 blocks (40 GB), *i.e.* one hour.
In practice, we detected the first collision
early, after only 30 minutes (231.3 blocks); as expected, the
predicted xor difference was correct. The full attack needs about
236.6 blocks (785 GB) to recover a two-block secret out of 4 kB
messages; this should take about 19 hours in this setting. **In our
demo, it took 18.6 hours and 705 GB, and we successfully
recovered the 16-byte authentication token.**

### Attacking Secure Cookies over HTTPS

The attack against HTTPS connection is very similar to the attack
against OpenVPN, as long as we have a client and server that negotiate
Triple-DES, and that keep a connection open for a long time.

Vulnerable Websites As detailed above, about 0.6% of the top Alexa 100K
websites support Triple-DES and allow long-lived HTTPS connections. This
list contains many high-profile e-commerce and banking websites.

We use the Javascript code described above,
but we note that with several Workers running in
parallel, modern browsers open a few parallel connections to
the server and split the requests over these connections.
For our attack, we need to maximize the throughput over a *single*
connection. This can be achieved by disturbing some of the connections
so that most of request are send in a single. In our setup, we used
iptables rules to limit the rate of all connections except one.
In a real attack, this would be done by an active man-in-the-middle, but
a passive man-in-the-middle can also mount the attack -- it will just
take more time to collect the data.

Proof-of-Concept Attack Demo
In our setup we use Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2 running
on Linux and an IIS 6.0 server
in a Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 Virtual machine. The default configuration of
IIS 6.0 with all recommended updates offers only RC4 and Triple-DES ciphers,
and will use Triple-DES with Firefox and other recent browsers where RC4 is
disabled. Moreover, IIS 6.0 supports HTTP/1.1 and keeps an active connection open
for an arbitrary long time.

On Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2, with a few dozen
Workers running in parallel, we can send up to 2000 requests
per second in a single TLS connection.
In our experiment, we were lucky to detect the first collision after
only 25 minutes (220.1 requests), and we verified that the
collision revealed the xor of two plaintexts blocks. As seen
previously, the full attack should require 236.6 blocks (785 GB) to
recover a two-block cookie, which should take 38 hours in our setting.
**Experimentally, we have recovered a two-block cookie from an HTTPS trace
of only 610 GB, captured in 30.5 hours.**

## Impact and Mitigation

We have demonstrated the first concrete attacks on mainstream Internet
protocols that exploit block cipher collisions. Our attacks can
recover valuable secrets such as HTTP cookies and passwords in under
40 hours. Our attacks impact a majority of OpenVPN connections and an
estimated 0.6% of HTTPS connections to popular websites. We expect
that our attacks also impact a number of SSH and IPsec connections,
but we do not have concrete measurements for these protocols. Like
many recent attacks on TLS, such a BEAST and RC4 NOMORE, the
underlying principles behind our attacks were well known to
cryptographers. Our goal is to raise awareness among practitioners
about the vulnerabilities of short block ciphers and on safe ways of
using them.

### Comparison with RC4 attacks

Our attack scenario is very similar to the setup of the recent
attacks on the use of RC4 in HTTPS. We use
the same man-in-the-browser setting to generate a large number of HTTP
requests, and the data complexity of the attack is comparable.
Our attack requires only 229.1 short queries of 512 bytes
(280 GB in total), which
can be reduced to 227.6 longer queries of 4 kB
(785 GB in total).
However, these numbers are for the
case when all the data is encrypted within the same session. Even if
the amount of data sent on a single connection is limited, as long as
the limit is close enough to the birthday bound, we can still mount
our attacks across multiple parallel and sequential sessions, albeit
with a higher data and time complexity.

### Mitigation

The obvious way to avoid these attacks is to stop using legacy 64-bit
block ciphers. Alternatively, the attack can be mitigated by rekeying
the session frequently.

Concretely, we recommend the following measures to prevent
our attack:

* Web servers and VPNs should be configured to prefer
  128-bit ciphers. According to our scans, about 1.1% of the top 100k
  web server from Alexa, and 0.5% of the top 1 million, support AES but
  prefer to use 3DES.
* Web browsers should offer 3DES as a fallback-only cipher, to
  avoid using it with servers that support AES but prefer 3DES.
* TLS libraries and applications should limit the length
  of TLS sessions with a 64-bit cipher. This could be done with TLS
  renegotiation, or in some cases by closing the connection and starting
  a new one (i.e. limiting HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive, SPDY, and HTTP/2
  with 3DES ciphersuites).
* OpenVPN users can change the cipher from the default Blowfish to AES, using
  for instance `cipher AES-128-CBC` on the client and
  server configuration. If they don't control the server
  configuration, they can mitigate the attack by forcing frequent
  rekeying with `reneg-bytes 64000000`.

### Responsible disclosure

We have communicated our results and concerns to the OpenVPN team, and
to various website owners, browser vendors, and TLS libraries. They all
acknowledged the
issue, and are working on implementing countermeasures. The TLS
vulnerability received CVE number CVE-2016-2183, and the OpenVPN
vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2016-6329.

**NIST** is working on
[deprecation
of 3DES](http://csrc.nist.gov/news_events/index.html#jul11). They plan to limit the use of 3DES to
220 blocks with a given key, and to disallow 3DES in TLS,
IPsec, and possibly other protocols.

**OpenVPN** [2.3.12](http://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-announce%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg00000.html) will [display](https://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg00029.html) a
[warning](https://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg00030.html) to users who choose to use 64-bit ciphers and encourage them
to transition to AES (cipher
negotiation is also being implemented in the 2.4 branch). It will also
implement a default
renegotiation limit of 64MB when used in TLS mode in a future version. A [wiki entry](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32) provides further details.

**OpenSSL** has moved 3DES ciphersuites from the
HIGH category to
MEDIUM in the [1.0.1](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e95f5e03f6f1f8d3f6cbe4b7fa48e57b4cf8fd60) and [1.0.2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0fff5065884d5ac61123a604bbcee30a53c808ff) branches, and will disable it by default in
the upcoming [1.1.0](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/ef28891bab7054667f2f6739f6d376c38b3ca1cc) release.
They have a [blog entry](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/) with further details.

**Akamai** will offer an option for web server
administrators to drop 3DES
from the offered ciphers.

**Apple** has disabled 3DES on icloud.com and is
recommending that
all its customers disable 3DES on their websites.

Currently, most browsers see about 1% of their connections using
3DES, and vendors consider this number too high to simply disable
3DES on the client side, since too many websites would be broken.
So, they are instead considering implementing data limits per
connection to force rekeying, or offering 3DES ciphersuites only in a
fallback negotiation if no AES ciphersuite is acceptable to the
server.

**Mozilla** is [implementing](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1267899) [data limits](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1268745) for all
ciphersuites. This has been integrated into [NSS 3.27](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.27_release_notes), which should be used in Firefox 51.

**Microsoft** has [removed](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3155527.aspx) 3DES from the False Start
whitelist.

More details about implemented countermeasures
will be added to this webpage as they become
available.

## FAQ

### Why is 3DES still used with a modern browser?

Because more than 1% of the web servers are poorly configured, and prefer using 3DES rather than AES.

### How can I check if my server is well configured?

You can use
the [scanning tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
form Qualys SSL Labs. In the "Handshake Simulation" section, you
should see 3DES or RC4 only with browsers that don't support
stronger ciphersuites, like IE6/XP and IE8/XP. If you have 3DES
ciphersuites at the bottom of the "Cipher Suites" section, you can
try to remove them, but it's not an immediate security issue.
Removing 3DES will protect you against potential downgrade attack,
but it will also break connections from older clients.

### How can I fix my server's configuration

You can follow the advice

### I'm using Blowfish-256, is it safe?

No, the attack is independent of the key length. It work on
Blowfish with any key length, and Triple-DES with 3 independent keys
(168 bits in total).

### Why Sweet32?

It's a stupid pun, based on
the [sweet
sixteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_sixteen_%28birthday%29) birthday celebration. Our attack is a birthday
attack (taking its name from the [birthday paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)) with complexity 232. You could also say that
232 is the *sweet spot* where attacks become practical.

### Can I use your logo to talk about the attack?

Yes, you can. To the extent possible under law, GaÃ«tan Leurent
has [waived

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

## Known issues

### Non APAR Defect 13042 - ISM agent doesn't start after upgrading Windows Box

**Problem Description**
  The Windows ISM agent is stopped after an upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support changes to define old and new agent registry keys.
 **Workaround**
  Reconfigure the ISM agent after the upgrade to resolve the problem.

### Non APAR Defect 10767 - ISM support file upgrades overwrites ismconfig.props

**Problem Description**
  ISM support files upgrades overwrite ismconfig.props. Note: ISM monitor props files are NOT overwritten.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support not overwriting ismconfig.props.
 **Workaround**
  Backup the ismconfig.props file before performing an upgrade of ISM support.

### Non APAR Defect 13701 - ismconfig.cmd fails to accept multiple white space enclosed in quotes(") in SOAP parameters

**Problem Description**
  ismconfig.cmd truncates multiple white spaces in SOAP parameters. For example the following SOAPInputs: @SOAPInputs [itinerary:{from:string,dest:string}[]=[{from='Perth,\" \",Australia',dest='Sydney'}]]"
 **Root cause**
  This problem is due to the command line interpretation of escaping the quotation character.
 **Workaround**
  Write command into a text file and use the ismconfig.cmd -file command to import the command(s).

### Non APAR Defect 14498 - Internet Service Monitor 7.3.0.1 upgrade fails with no existing image to upgrade error

**Problem Description**
  When upgrading the ISM the upgrade can fail with the following error:
 mkdir: 0653-357 Cannot access directory /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses.
 /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 cp: /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses/isv730: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 KCIIN2593E
 The CD you are trying to install is a fixpack CD and cannot be installed on a machine without an existing image to upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installation script expects the following directory to exist in the previous installation: $CANDLEHOME/licenses

 If this doesn't exists it cannot detect the previous ISM installation correctly causing the upgrade to stop.
 **Workaround**
  Create the $CANDLEHOME/licenses directory and re-run the installation.
 Refer to the [technote](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618763) for more information.

## Known limitations

### Non APAR Defect 16289 - Remote Upgrade

**Problem Description**
  Remote upgrades using the tacmd updateAgent command on Linux x86\_64 fails. Please use a local installation for this Operating System.
### Change of Summarized Data

**Problem Description**
  After upgrading earlier versions of the ISM application, summarized data may not be visible, since the summarization behaviour has changed. This issue can be resolved by re-summarizing your existing detailed data. Please refer to this [technote](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443517) for more information.
### SOAP Monitor Does Not Support Nested Arrays or multiRef Values

**Problem Description**
  The SOAP monitor is unable to handle parameters containing nested (two or more dimension) arrays or those that are referenced externally in the 'multiRef' style.
## Installation information

For AIX, if upgrading from an ISM 6.0.1 release, you must uninstall the product and perform a new install. This does not apply for other ISM 6 releases. For more information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21321186>

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.3.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)
 [Installing on Linux or UNIX systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_unix_itcam.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.3.0.1. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.30.01.29'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Troubleshooting installation problems from the Support site

For more detailed information, refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_install_chapter.html>

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

For detailed instructions, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.3.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_uninstall_chapter.html>

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>
  + **WARNING –** take special care to note the known issues with HA upgrades: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha_notes.html#known-issues>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    Wed, 9 April 2014 15:31:20 +0100

    Security updates:

        CVE-2014-0160: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL
                       1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat
                       Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain
                       sensitive information from process memory via crafted
                       packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated
                       by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and t1_lib.c,
                       aka the Heartbleed bug.

                       The syslog-ng Premium Edition 5 LTS was packaged with a
                       vulnerable OpenSSL version. OpenSSL has been patched and
                       updated in this release and syslog-ng PE is no longer vulnerable
                       to this attack. Earlier versions of syslog-ng PE are not affected.

# Chef Server Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) Releases

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Ohai Chefs! Today we’re releasing patched versions of Open Source Chef Server and Enterprise Chef that address the OpenSSL security vulnerability [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com). We recommend that you upgrade your Chef Server install immediately. You will need to take the following steps to fully address the OpenSSL vulnerability:

* **Upgrade to the Latest Version of the Chef Server –** The latest version of the Chef Server is updated with a patched version of OpenSSL.
* **Regenerate the Chef Server’s SSL Keys –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available.
* **Change Your Secrets –** While your Chef Server install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised. Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Chef Server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.

## Server Releases

* [Enterprise Chef 11.1.3](https://www.getchef.com:443/blog/2014/04/09/enterprise-chef-11-1-3-release/)
* [Enterprise Chef 1.4.9](https://www.getchef.com:443/blog/2014/04/09/enterprise-chef-1-4-9-release/)
* [Open Source Chef 11.0.12](https://www.getchef.com:443/blog/2014/04/09/chef-server-11-0-12-release/)

## Enterprise Add-ons

The Enterprise add-ons for Enterprise Chef also ship with a compromised version of OpenSSL, however those services piggyback on the Nginx HTTP proxy that ships with Enterprise Chef to do SSL negotiation. This means that these services (Chef Manage, Chef Reporting, Chef Push Server) don’t require a patched version outside of Enterprise Chef. We will, however, be shipping new packages for these add-ons shortly to ensure that they are on the latest version of OpenSSL.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Alert
# OpenSSL 'Heartbleed' vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160)

Last RevisedOctober 05, 2016
Alert CodeTA14-098A

### Systems Affected

* OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f
* OpenSSL 1.0.2-beta

### Overview

A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to expose sensitive data, possibly including user authentication credentials and secret keys, through incorrect memory handling in the TLS heartbeat extension.

OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f contain a flaw in its implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. This flaw allows an attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL library in chunks of 64k at a time. Note that an attacker can repeatedly leverage the vulnerability to retrieve as many 64k chunks of memory as are necessary to retrieve the intended secrets. The sensitive information that may be retrieved using this vulnerability include:

* Primary key material (secret keys)
* Secondary key material (user names and passwords used by vulnerable services)
* Protected content (sensitive data used by vulnerable services)
* Collateral (memory addresses and content that can be leveraged to bypass exploit mitigations)

Exploit code is publicly available for this vulnerability.  Additional details may be found in [CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU#720951](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/720951).

### Impact

This flaw allows a remote attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL library in chunks of 64k at a time.

### Solution

[OpenSSL 1.0.1g](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt) has been released to address this vulnerability.  Any keys generated with a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be considered compromised and regenerated and deployed after the patch has been applied.

US-CERT recommends system administrators consider implementing [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy) to mitigate the damage that may be caused by future private key disclosures.

# Chef Server 11.0.12 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Chef Server 11.0.12 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Chef Server should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be understated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Chef Server install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Chef Server, visit <https://www.getchef.com/chef/install>

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_open_source.html#upgrade-to-newer-versions-of-chef-server-11>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/open_source/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Chef Server install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Chef Server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Security Fixes

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Chef Server 11.0.11:

* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)
* [libcurl] Patch for address wildcard certificate validation (CVE-2014-0139)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl (CVE-2014-1563)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Winssl (CVE-2014-2522)
* [openssl] Patch for heartbeat extension exposing process memory (CVE-2014-0160)
* [libyaml] Patch for arbitrary code execution vulnerability (CVE-2014-2525)

# Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Bug Fixes:

The following bug fixes have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [private-chef-cookbooks] Provide default value for jetty log path to fix dotfile deletion bug.
* [private-chef-ctl] private-chef-ctl password fixed to work correctly after a regression introduced in EC 1.4.6.
* [private-chef-cookbooks] Manage /var/log/opscode permissions even with non 0022 umask.

### Security Fixes:

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [opscode-webui] Incorporate patches to address several identified potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities in the Rails framework.
* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)

## OpenSSL TLS heartbeat extension read overflow discloses sensitive information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#720951

Original Release Date: 2014-04-08 | Last Revised: 2016-05-13

---

### Overview

OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 beta contain a vulnerability that could disclose sensitive private information to an attacker. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "heartbleed."

### Description

| OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f and 1.0.2 beta through 1.0.2-beta1 contain a flaw in its implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality ([RFC6520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520)). This flaw allows an attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL libssl library in chunks of up to 64k at a time. Note that an attacker can repeatedly leverage the vulnerability to increase the chances that a leaked chunk contains the intended secrets. The sensitive information that may be retrieved using this vulnerability include:     + Primary key material (secret keys) + Secondary key material (user names and passwords used by vulnerable services) + Protected content (sensitive data used by vulnerable services) + Collateral (memory addresses and content that can be leveraged to bypass exploit mitigations)  Please see the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) website for more details. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. Any service that supports STARTTLS (imap,smtp,http,pop) may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By attacking a service that uses a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive information, such as secret keys. By leveraging this information, an attacker may be able to decrypt, spoof, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on network traffic that would otherwise be protected by OpenSSL. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in [OpenSSL 1.0.1g](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt). Please contact your software vendor to check for availability of updates. Any system that may have exposed this vulnerability should regenerate any sensitive information (secret keys, passwords, etc.) with the assumption that an attacker has already used this vulnerability to obtain those items. Old keys should be revoked.Reports indicate that the use of mod\_spdy can prevent the updated OpenSSL library from being utilized, as mod\_spdy uses its own copy of OpenSSL. Please see <https://code.google.com/p/mod-spdy/issues/detail?id=85> for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable OpenSSL heartbeat support**This issue can be addressed by recompiling OpenSSL with the -DOPENSSL\_NO\_HEARTBEATS flag. Software that uses OpenSSL, such as Apache or Nginx would need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.**Use Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**[PFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) can help minimize the damage in the case of a secret key leak by making it more difficult to decrypt already-captured network traffic. However, if a ticket key is leaked, then any sessions that use that ticket could be compromised. Ticket keys may only be regenerated when a web server is restarted. |

### [MarkLogic Corporation](#WDON-9J3S5J) Affected

Updated:  April 15, 2014

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

Recently a serious security vulnerability was discovered in the OpenSSL
cryptographic software
library. MarkLogic application servers can be configured to use SSL, and
MarkLogic uses OpenSSL to
provide this capability. A patch to OpenSSL has been released to address
this vulnerability, and
MarkLogic has built patches for all impacted MarkLogic versions with
OpenSSL 1.0.1g to incorporate
this new fix.

Impacted Versions

The following versions of MarkLogic are impacted by this vulnerability:

·            MarkLogic 5.0-5 through 5.0-6

·            All versions of MarkLogic 6.0 (6.0-1 through 6.0-5)

·            All versions of MarkLogic 7.0 (7.0-1 through 7.0-2.2),
including the MarkLogic AMIs

MarkLogic versions prior to 5.0-5 use an earlier version of OpenSSL that
does not have this
vulnerability.

How to Patch

We recommend that customers who are using SSL patch their systems
immediately. To do this:

1.          Upgrade your cluster to the patch release, available at
<http://developer.marklogic.com/products>.

Patch release versions are as follows:

o   MarkLogic 5.0-6.1

o   MarkLogic 6.0-5.1

o   MarkLogic 7.0-2.3

2.          Regenerate all SSL certificates for your cluster. This is
necessary because the
vulnerability is such that private keys for your certificates are
potentially compromised. See
𠇌onfiguring SSL on App Servers” in the documentation:

o   MarkLogic 5 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/5.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

o   MarkLogic 6 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/6.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

o   MarkLogic 7 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

3.          If you are using BASIC or Application Level Authentication over
SSL, have all your
users change their passwords after you've patched and deployed new SSL
certificates. This includes
both internal users in our security database, and anyone using external
authentication (which
requires BASIC authentication over SSL). This is necessary because the
vulnerability may have
resulted in password leaks.

If you have any questions about how to patch, feel free to contact
support@marklogic.com.

### Vendor Information

**Heartbleed bug – Public and Client Communication**

Dear Unisys client,

Unisys prides itself on ensuring the mission-critical operations of our clients – and the security of your systems is a priority for us. I am writing to let you know how we are addressing any risks related to the Heartbleed bug that has been reported in the news and to provide you with information that may help you address your own risks.

Heartbleed is a software bug in the OpenSSL technology used to create a secure link over the Internet between a server and a computer asset such as a laptop or PC. The bug, which has existed for about two years but was only publicly disclosed last week, is believed to have affected a significant number of websites globally.

Unisys has undertaken a comprehensive review of our servers, products, and client-owned servers under our management for risks associated with the Heartbleed bug. Here’s what you need to know:

-We have not found any vulnerability in our public-facing Web servers. We continue to monitor the product advisories of our major vendors for any potential issues.

-The vast majority of our released products, including MCP, OS 2200, Forward!, Stealth, and Choreographer, are not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug. Two instances of potential vulnerabilities were found in add-on products; in those cases, we have done remediation efforts and notified clients.

-The vast majority of client-owned servers under our management are not affected by the Heartbleed bug. For servers that may have been affected, we have notified the client and after consulting with the client, we are in the process of patching those servers, changing the server side certificates and instructing users to change their passwords.

-Currently, only version 1.0.1 - 1.0.1f of the open-source SSL is affected. We have upgraded any client-owned servers under our management to version 1.0.1g. We recommend that you check the other servers that you manage.

-Our Security Services team can help you in this process and can also perform a penetration test to determine if you are vulnerable and help you contain any resulting damage.

We stand ready to assist you. Please contact your Unisys representative or service delivery manager to discuss your requirements or to order a penetration test.

We appreciate your business.

CORRECTED IN RELEASE:
All current releases of Brocade products, including Vyatta

BULLETIN OVERVIEW

The purpose of this bulletin is to provide information regarding the recently
disclosed vulnerability in the OpenSSL protocol documented by CVE-2014-0160 and
also known as "The Heartbleed bug."  This vulnerability takes advantage of the
heartbeat extensions to the OpenSSL protocol (RFC6520).

Brocade's family of IP products ADX, FCX, ICX, MLX, MLX-E, XMR CES, CER, RX,
SX, VDX offering ServerIron, FastIron, NetIron, RX, Network OS, Brocade Network
Advisor, Vyatta and vADX software and SAN products offering FOS software do not
make use of the heartbeat extensions and hence are not vulnerable to the
exploit documented in CVE-2014-0160.
In addition, the MyBrocade.com  web site does not use OpenSSL and is not
vulnerable to this issue.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not
properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that
trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to
d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.

# RHSA-2014:0396 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0396)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 3.2.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Important: This update is an emergency security fix being provided outside
the scope of the published support policy for Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization listed in the References section. In accordance with the
support policy for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor 3.2 will not receive future security updates.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects this issue.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To upgrade Hypervisors in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environments
using the disk image provided by this package, refer to:

Check your system rubies for vulnerable OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 "Heartbleed")

 [Raw](/chapmajs/10473815/raw/161d68803f8def265a416115b1d3046f68566046/description.md)

[**description.md**](#file-description-md)

So apparently MRI brings along its own statically linked OpenSSL:

```
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013

$ ruby -v
ruby 2.1.1p76 (2014-02-24 revision 45161) [x86_64-darwin12.0]

$ ruby -r openssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION'
OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014

```

...which is great except that no one seems to be rebuilding MRI binaries (confirmed with Slackware 14.1, current Arch Linux, and rvm 1.25.22). If you're running something that uses MRI's OpenSSL and listens for incoming traffic, you're vulnerable. Steps to reproduce:

* imploded/reinstalled RVM
* `rvm install 2.1`
* `gem install rails`
* `rails new` a sample project with Rails 4.1.0
* enable SSL with WEBrick (try [this blog post](https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/employee-posts/configuring-webrick-to-use-ssl))

Then hit the HTTPS server with Jared Stafford's (jspenguin@jspenguin.org) CVE-2014-0160 "Heartbleed" demo. WEBrick will reliably return 16K of memory above the buffer, which will include bits of requests if the server has recently been connected to.

#### Your Donation

JavaScript is blocked, deactivated or not supported by this browser.

The services we use to process online donations (Stripe, Paypal, and BTCPay Server) all require JavaScript. If you’d like to support the Tor Project without JavaScript you can donate cryptocurrency directly using the wallet addresses below, [send checks, cash, and money orders by mail](/faq/#faqDonate3a), or donate more than $1,000 by [bank transfer (US only)](/faq/#faqDonate2a).

Alternatively, you can whitelist donate.torproject.org or temporarily enable JavaScript. Tor Browser users on the Safest security level can do so by temporarily downgrading to Safer in about:preferences#privacy.

Make sure to copy the wallet addresses exactly when making your donation, as we cannot recover funds sent to the wrong wallet. If you have any questions, please email us at giving@torproject.org.

# Splunk 6.0.3 addresses two vulnerabilities

**Advisory ID:** SP-CAAAMB3

**CVE ID:** [-](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=-)

**Published:** 2014-04-10

**Last Update:**

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** -,

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [-](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#-)

**CWE:** [-](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/.html)

**Bug ID:** -

## Description

Splunk version 6.0.3 addresses the following two vulnerabilities:

* OpenSSL 1.0.1 TLS Heartbeat leaks sensitive information (SPL-82696, CVE-2014-0160)
* Invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception (SPL-78823, CVE-2013-4353)
* At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Previous Product Security Announcements can be found on our Splunk Product Security Portal. Use SPL numbers when referencing issues in communication with Splunk. If there is no CVE Identifier listed with a vulnerability, it will be added once it is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority. To standardize the calculation of severity scores for each vulnerability, when appropriate, Splunk uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2.

## Affected Products and Components

The security vulnerabilities addressed by this maintenance release affect indexers, search heads, forwarders, deployment servers, and license servers in the following versions:

* SPL-82696: Splunk 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2
* SPL-78823: Splunk 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2
  ## Mitigation and Upgrades

  To mitigate this issue, Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest release and applying as many of the Hardening Standards from the Securing Splunk documentation as are relevant to your environment. Splunk releases are cumulative, meaning that future releases will contain fixes to these vulnerabilities, new features and other bug fixes.

## Vulnerability Descriptions and Ratings

### OpenSSL 1.0.1 TLS Heartbeat leaks sensitive information (SPL-82696, CVE-2014-0160)

**Description**: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.

### CVSS Severity (version 2.0):

**CVSS Base Score 5.0**

CVSS Impact Subscore 2.9

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 10.0

**Overall CVSS Score 5.0**

### Invalid TLS handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception (SPL-78823, CVE-2013-4353)

**Description**: The ssl3\_take\_mac function in ssl/s3\_both.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1f allows remote TLS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted Next Protocol Negotiation record in a TLS handshake.

#### CVSS Severity (version 2.0):

**CVSS Base Score 4.3**

CVSS Impact Subscore 2.9

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 8.6

**Overall CVSS Score 4.3**

## OpenSSL TLS heartbeat extension read overflow discloses sensitive information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#720951

Original Release Date: 2014-04-08 | Last Revised: 2016-05-13

---

### Overview

OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 beta contain a vulnerability that could disclose sensitive private information to an attacker. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "heartbleed."

### Description

| OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f and 1.0.2 beta through 1.0.2-beta1 contain a flaw in its implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality ([RFC6520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520)). This flaw allows an attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL libssl library in chunks of up to 64k at a time. Note that an attacker can repeatedly leverage the vulnerability to increase the chances that a leaked chunk contains the intended secrets. The sensitive information that may be retrieved using this vulnerability include:     + Primary key material (secret keys) + Secondary key material (user names and passwords used by vulnerable services) + Protected content (sensitive data used by vulnerable services) + Collateral (memory addresses and content that can be leveraged to bypass exploit mitigations)  Please see the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) website for more details. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. Any service that supports STARTTLS (imap,smtp,http,pop) may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By attacking a service that uses a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive information, such as secret keys. By leveraging this information, an attacker may be able to decrypt, spoof, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on network traffic that would otherwise be protected by OpenSSL. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in [OpenSSL 1.0.1g](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt). Please contact your software vendor to check for availability of updates. Any system that may have exposed this vulnerability should regenerate any sensitive information (secret keys, passwords, etc.) with the assumption that an attacker has already used this vulnerability to obtain those items. Old keys should be revoked.Reports indicate that the use of mod\_spdy can prevent the updated OpenSSL library from being utilized, as mod\_spdy uses its own copy of OpenSSL. Please see <https://code.google.com/p/mod-spdy/issues/detail?id=85> for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable OpenSSL heartbeat support**This issue can be addressed by recompiling OpenSSL with the -DOPENSSL\_NO\_HEARTBEATS flag. Software that uses OpenSSL, such as Apache or Nginx would need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.**Use Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**[PFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) can help minimize the damage in the case of a secret key leak by making it more difficult to decrypt already-captured network traffic. However, if a ticket key is leaked, then any sessions that use that ticket could be compromised. Ticket keys may only be regenerated when a web server is restarted. |

### [MarkLogic Corporation](#WDON-9J3S5J) Affected

Updated:  April 15, 2014

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

Recently a serious security vulnerability was discovered in the OpenSSL
cryptographic software
library. MarkLogic application servers can be configured to use SSL, and
MarkLogic uses OpenSSL to
provide this capability. A patch to OpenSSL has been released to address
this vulnerability, and
MarkLogic has built patches for all impacted MarkLogic versions with
OpenSSL 1.0.1g to incorporate
this new fix.

Impacted Versions

The following versions of MarkLogic are impacted by this vulnerability:

·            MarkLogic 5.0-5 through 5.0-6

·            All versions of MarkLogic 6.0 (6.0-1 through 6.0-5)

·            All versions of MarkLogic 7.0 (7.0-1 through 7.0-2.2),
including the MarkLogic AMIs

MarkLogic versions prior to 5.0-5 use an earlier version of OpenSSL that
does not have this
vulnerability.

How to Patch

We recommend that customers who are using SSL patch their systems
immediately. To do this:

1.          Upgrade your cluster to the patch release, available at
<http://developer.marklogic.com/products>.

Patch release versions are as follows:

o   MarkLogic 5.0-6.1

o   MarkLogic 6.0-5.1

o   MarkLogic 7.0-2.3

2.          Regenerate all SSL certificates for your cluster. This is
necessary because the
vulnerability is such that private keys for your certificates are
potentially compromised. See
𠇌onfiguring SSL on App Servers” in the documentation:

o   MarkLogic 5 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/5.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

o   MarkLogic 6 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/6.0/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

o   MarkLogic 7 documentation:
<http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/SSL#chapter>

3.          If you are using BASIC or Application Level Authentication over
SSL, have all your
users change their passwords after you've patched and deployed new SSL
certificates. This includes
both internal users in our security database, and anyone using external
authentication (which
requires BASIC authentication over SSL). This is necessary because the
vulnerability may have
resulted in password leaks.

If you have any questions about how to patch, feel free to contact
support@marklogic.com.

### Vendor Information

**Heartbleed bug – Public and Client Communication**

Dear Unisys client,

Unisys prides itself on ensuring the mission-critical operations of our clients – and the security of your systems is a priority for us. I am writing to let you know how we are addressing any risks related to the Heartbleed bug that has been reported in the news and to provide you with information that may help you address your own risks.

Heartbleed is a software bug in the OpenSSL technology used to create a secure link over the Internet between a server and a computer asset such as a laptop or PC. The bug, which has existed for about two years but was only publicly disclosed last week, is believed to have affected a significant number of websites globally.

Unisys has undertaken a comprehensive review of our servers, products, and client-owned servers under our management for risks associated with the Heartbleed bug. Here’s what you need to know:

-We have not found any vulnerability in our public-facing Web servers. We continue to monitor the product advisories of our major vendors for any potential issues.

-The vast majority of our released products, including MCP, OS 2200, Forward!, Stealth, and Choreographer, are not vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug. Two instances of potential vulnerabilities were found in add-on products; in those cases, we have done remediation efforts and notified clients.

-The vast majority of client-owned servers under our management are not affected by the Heartbleed bug. For servers that may have been affected, we have notified the client and after consulting with the client, we are in the process of patching those servers, changing the server side certificates and instructing users to change their passwords.

-Currently, only version 1.0.1 - 1.0.1f of the open-source SSL is affected. We have upgraded any client-owned servers under our management to version 1.0.1g. We recommend that you check the other servers that you manage.

-Our Security Services team can help you in this process and can also perform a penetration test to determine if you are vulnerable and help you contain any resulting damage.

We stand ready to assist you. Please contact your Unisys representative or service delivery manager to discuss your requirements or to order a penetration test.

We appreciate your business.

TSB 2014-185-ASEVERITY:  Low - Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
All Brocade products, including Vyatta

CORRECTED IN RELEASE:
All current releases of Brocade products, including Vyatta

BULLETIN OVERVIEW

The purpose of this bulletin is to provide information regarding the recently
disclosed vulnerability in the OpenSSL protocol documented by CVE-2014-0160 and
also known as "The Heartbleed bug."  This vulnerability takes advantage of the
heartbeat extensions to the OpenSSL protocol (RFC6520).

Brocade's family of IP products ADX, FCX, ICX, MLX, MLX-E, XMR CES, CER, RX,
SX, VDX offering ServerIron, FastIron, NetIron, RX, Network OS, Brocade Network
Advisor, Vyatta and vADX software and SAN products offering FOS software do not
make use of the heartbeat extensions and hence are not vulnerable to the
exploit documented in CVE-2014-0160.
In addition, the MyBrocade.com  web site does not use OpenSSL and is not
vulnerable to this issue.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not
properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that
trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to
d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.

# The Heartbleed Bug

![Heartbleed Bug](heartbleed.png)

The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web, email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs).

The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.

### What leaks in practice?

We have tested some of our own services from attacker's perspective. We attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace. Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.

### How to stop the leak?

As long as the vulnerable version of OpenSSL is in use it can be abused. [Fixed OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20140407.txt) has been released and now it has to be deployed. Operating system vendors and distribution, appliance vendors, independent software vendors have to adopt the fix and notify their users. Service providers and users have to install the fix as it becomes available for the operating systems, networked appliances and software they use.

### Q&A

#### What is the CVE-2014-0160?

CVE-2014-0160 is the official reference to this bug. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is the Standard for Information Security Vulnerability Names maintained by [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/). Due to co-incident discovery a duplicate CVE, CVE-2014-0346, which was assigned to us, should not be used, since others independently went public with the CVE-2014-0160 identifier.

#### Why it is called the Heartbleed Bug?

Bug is in the OpenSSL's implementation of the TLS/DTLS ([transport layer security protocols](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/fuzz-testing/defensics.html)) heartbeat extension (RFC6520). When it is exploited it leads to the leak of memory contents from the server to the client and from the client to the server.

#### What makes the Heartbleed Bug unique?

Bugs in single software or library come and go and are fixed by new versions. However this bug has left large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the Internet. Considering the long exposure, ease of exploitation and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously.

#### Is this a design flaw in SSL/TLS protocol specification?

No. This is implementation problem, i.e. programming mistake in popular OpenSSL library that provides cryptographic services such as SSL/TLS to the applications and services.

#### What is being leaked?

Encryption is used to protect secrets that may harm your privacy or security if they leak. In order to coordinate recovery from this bug we have classified the compromised secrets to four categories: 1) primary key material, 2) secondary key material and 3) protected content and 4) collateral.

#### What is leaked primary key material and how to recover?

These are the crown jewels, the encryption keys themselves. Leaked secret keys allow the attacker to decrypt any past and future traffic to the protected services and to impersonate the service at will. Any protection given by the encryption and the signatures in the X.509 certificates can be bypassed. Recovery from this leak requires patching the vulnerability, revocation of the compromised keys and reissuing and redistributing new keys. Even doing all this will still leave any traffic intercepted by the attacker in the past still vulnerable to decryption. All this has to be done by the owners of the services.

#### What is leaked secondary key material and how to recover?

These are for example the user credentials (user names and passwords) used in the vulnerable services. Recovery from this leak requires owners of the service first to restore trust to the service according to steps described above. After this users can start changing their passwords and possible encryption keys according to the instructions from the owners of the services that have been compromised. All session keys and session cookies should be invalidated and considered compromised.

#### What is leaked protected content and how to recover?

This is the actual content handled by the vulnerable services. It may be personal or financial details, private communication such as emails or instant messages, documents or anything seen worth protecting by encryption. Only owners of the services will be able to estimate the likelihood what has been leaked and they should notify their users accordingly. Most important thing is to restore trust to the primary and secondary key material as described above. Only this enables safe use of the compromised services in the future.

#### What is leaked collateral and how to recover?

Leaked collateral are other details that have been exposed to the attacker in the leaked memory content. These may contain technical details such as memory addresses and security measures such as canaries used to protect against overflow attacks. These have only contemporary value and will lose their value to the attacker when OpenSSL has been upgraded to a fixed version.

#### Recovery sounds laborious, is there a short cut?

After seeing what we saw by "attacking" ourselves, with ease, we decided to take this very seriously. We have gone laboriously through patching our own critical services and are dealing with possible compromise of our primary and secondary key material. All this just in case we were not first ones to discover this and this could have been exploited in the wild already.

#### How revocation and reissuing of certificates works in practice?

If you are a service provider you have signed your certificates with a Certificate Authority (CA). You need to check your CA how compromised keys can be revoked and new certificate reissued for the new keys. Some CAs do this for free, some may take a fee.

#### Am I affected by the bug?

You are likely to be affected either directly or indirectly. OpenSSL is the most popular open source cryptographic library and TLS (transport layer security) implementation used to encrypt traffic on the Internet. Your popular social site, your company's site, commerce site, hobby site, site you install software from or even sites run by your government might be using vulnerable OpenSSL. Many of online services use TLS to both to identify themselves to you and to protect your privacy and transactions. You might have networked appliances with logins secured by this buggy implementation of the TLS. Furthermore you might have client side software on your computer that could expose the data from your computer if you connect to compromised services.

#### How widespread is this?

The most notable software using OpenSSL are the open source web servers like Apache and nginx. The combined market share of just those two out of the active sites on the Internet was over 66% according to [Netcraft's April 2014 Web Server Survey](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/04/02/april-2014-web-server-survey.html). Furthermore OpenSSL is used to protect for example email servers (SMTP, POP and IMAP protocols), chat servers (XMPP protocol), virtual private networks (SSL VPNs), network appliances and wide variety of client side software. Fortunately many large consumer sites are saved by their conservative choice of SSL/TLS termination equipment and software. Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to latest and best encryption will be affected most. Furthermore OpenSSL is very popular in client software and somewhat popular in networked appliances which have most inertia in getting updates.

#### What versions of the OpenSSL are affected?

Status of different versions:

* OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable
* OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable
* OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable
* OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable

Bug was introduced to OpenSSL in December 2011 and has been out in the wild since OpenSSL release 1.0.1 on 14th of March 2012. OpenSSL 1.0.1g released on 7th of April 2014 fixes the bug.

#### How common are the vulnerable OpenSSL versions?

The vulnerable versions have been out there for over two years now and they have been rapidly adopted by modern operating systems. A major contributing factor has been that TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 came available with the first vulnerable OpenSSL version (1.0.1) and security community has been pushing the TLS 1.2 due to earlier attacks against TLS (such as the [BEAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack)).

#### How about operating systems?

Some operating system distributions that have shipped with potentially vulnerable OpenSSL version:

* Debian Wheezy (stable), OpenSSL 1.0.1e-2+deb7u4
* Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, OpenSSL 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.11
* CentOS 6.5, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-15
* Fedora 18, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-4
* OpenBSD 5.3 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012) and 5.4 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012)
* FreeBSD 10.0 - OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
* NetBSD 5.0.2 (OpenSSL 1.0.1e)
* OpenSUSE 12.2 (OpenSSL 1.0.1c)

Operating system distribution with versions that are not vulnerable:

* Debian Squeeze (oldstable), OpenSSL 0.9.8o-4squeeze14
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
* FreeBSD 8.4 - OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013
* FreeBSD 9.2 - OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013
* FreeBSD 10.0p1 - OpenSSL 1.0.1g (At 8 Apr 18:27:46 2014 UTC)
* FreeBSD Ports - OpenSSL 1.0.1g (At 7 Apr 21:46:40 2014 UTC)

#### How can OpenSSL be fixed?

Even though the actual code fix may appear trivial, OpenSSL team is the expert in fixing it properly so fixed version 1.0.1g or newer should be used. If this is not possible software developers can recompile OpenSSL with the handshake removed from the code by compile time option `-DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS`.

#### Should heartbeat be removed to aid in detection of vulnerable services?

Recovery from this bug might have benefitted if the new version of the OpenSSL would both have fixed the bug and disabled heartbeat temporarily until some future version. Majority, if not almost all, of TLS implementations that responded to the heartbeat request at the time of discovery were vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. If only vulnerable versions of OpenSSL would have continued to respond to the heartbeat for next few months then large scale coordinated response to reach owners of vulnerable services would become more feasible. However, swift response by the Internet community in developing online and standalone detection tools quickly surpassed the need for removing heartbeat altogether.

#### Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?

Exploitation of this bug does not leave any trace of anything abnormal happening to the logs.

#### Can IDS/IPS detect or block this attack?

Although the heartbeat can appear in different phases of the connection setup, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rules to detect heartbeat have been developed. Due to encryption differentiating between legitimate use and attack cannot be based on the content of the request, but the attack may be detected by comparing the size of the request against the size of the reply. This implies that IDS/IPS can be programmed to detect the attack but not to block it unless heartbeat requests are blocked altogether.

#### Has this been abused in the wild?

We don't know. Security community should deploy TLS/DTLS honeypots that entrap attackers and to alert about exploitation attempts.

#### Can attacker access only 64k of the memory?

There is no total of 64 kilobytes limitation to the attack, that limit applies only to a single heartbeat. Attacker can either keep reconnecting or during an active TLS connection keep requesting arbitrary number of 64 kilobyte chunks of memory content until enough secrets are revealed.

#### Is this a MITM bug like Apple's goto fail bug was?

No, this does not require a man in the middle attack (MITM). Attacker can directly contact the vulnerable service or attack any user connecting to a malicious service. However in addition to direct threat the theft of the key material allows man in the middle attackers to impersonate compromised services.

#### Does TLS client certificate authentication mitigate this?

No, heartbeat request can be sent and is replied to during the handshake phase of the protocol. This occurs prior to client certificate authentication.

#### Does OpenSSL's FIPS mode mitigate this?

No, OpenSSL Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode has no effect on the vulnerable heartbeat functionality.

#### Does Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) mitigate this?

Use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), which is unfortunately rare but powerful, should protect past communications from retrospective decryption. Please see <https://twitter.com/ivanristic/status/453280081897467905> how leaked tickets may affect this.

#### Can heartbeat extension be disabled during the TLS handshake?

No, vulnerable heartbeat extension code is activated regardless of the results of the handshake phase negotiations. Only way to protect yourself is to upgrade to fixed version of OpenSSL or to recompile OpenSSL with the handshake removed from the code.

#### Who found the Heartbleed Bug?

This bug was independently discovered by a team of security engineers (Riku, Antti and Matti) at [Codenomicon](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/fuzz-testing.html) and Neel Mehta of Google Security, who first reported it to the OpenSSL team. Codenomicon team found heartbleed bug while improving the SafeGuard feature in Codenomicon's Defensics [security testing tools](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing.html) and reported this bug to the NCSC-FI for vulnerability coordination and reporting to OpenSSL team.

#### What is the Defensics SafeGuard?

The SafeGuard feature of the Codenomicon's Defensics security testtools automatically tests the target system for weaknesses that compromise the integrity, privacy or safety. The SafeGuard is systematic solution to expose failed cryptographic certificate checks, privacy leaks or authentication bypass weaknesses that have exposed the Internet users to man in the middle attacks and eavesdropping. In addition to the Heartbleed bug the new Defensics TLS Safeguard feature can detect for instance the exploitable security flaw in widely used GnuTLS open source software implementing SSL/TLS functionality and the ["goto fail;"](https://gotofail.com/) bug in Apple's TLS/SSL implementation that was patched in February 2014.

#### Who coordinates response to this vulnerability?

Immediately after our discovery of the bug on 3rd of April 2014, [NCSC-FI](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en) took up the task of verifying it, analyzing it further and reaching out to the authors of OpenSSL, software, operating system and appliance vendors, which were potentially affected. However, this vulnerability had been found and details released independently by others before this work was completed. Vendors should be notifying their users and service providers. Internet service providers should be notifying their end users where and when potential action is required.

#### Is there a bright side to all this?

For those service providers who are affected this is a good opportunity to upgrade security strength of the secret keys used. A lot of software gets updates which otherwise would have not been urgent. Although this is painful for the security community, we can rest assured that infrastructure of the cyber criminals and their secrets have been exposed as well.

#### What can be done to prevent this from happening in future?

The security community, we included, must learn to find these inevitable human mistakes sooner. Please support the development effort of software you trust your privacy to. [Donate money to the OpenSSL project.](https://www.openssl.org/support/donations.html)

#### Where to find more information?

This Q&A was published as a follow-up to the OpenSSL advisory, since this vulnerability became public on 7th of April 2014. The OpenSSL project has made a statement at [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv\_20140407.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20140407.txt). Individual vendors of operating system distributions, affected owners of Internet services, software packages and appliance vendors may issue their own advisories.

1) problem description, brief discussion
An issue with critical severity in the openssl 1.0.1 library has been
identified, under the code name "HeartBleed" (CVE-2014-0160).
In openssl 1.0.1 up to and including 1.0.1f, the TLS "Heartbeat"
extension could be used to disclose memory of the process handling
the SSL/TLS connection in a easily exploitable way.
The disclosed memory can include and according to reports did include:
- secret key material (for SSL certificates)
- passwords and other authentication credentials (e.g. http cookies)
- other sensitive data transferred over SSL
This problem affected only openSUSE 12.3 and 13.1, which include
openssl 1.0.1e.
We have released updates for openSUSE 12.3 and 13.1, see
the associated automated update notice for package details:
<http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2014-04/msg00004.html>
For further reading:
<http://heartbleed.com/>
2) affected products
openSUSE 12.3 and 13.1 are affected by this problem.
SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and older products currently include openssl
0.9.8j or older versions, which do not include the TLS Heartbeat
extension and thus are not affected by this problem.
3) solution/workaround
There is no workaround, please install the supplied updates.
4) special instructions and notes
After installing the updates, we strongly advise you to:
- Get new SSL certificates for the affected services.
- If your SSL service handled password authentication we recommend
to initiate password changes ASAP.
- Invalidate other sensitive data that may have been stored in the
memory of an exposed process, such as cookies or private URLs.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0376)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
reporter.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Updated openssl package fix two security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 08 Apr 2014

Modification date: 08 Apr 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-0076](CVE-2014-0076.html)
,
[CVE-2014-0160](CVE-2014-0160.html)

## Description

```
Updated openssl packages fix security vulnerability:

The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL through 1.0.0l does not ensure
that certain swap operations have a constant-time behavior, which makes it
easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache
side-channel attack (CVE-2014-0076).

A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension in
OpenSSL through 1.0.1f can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a
connected client or server (CVE-2014-0160).

```

# Version history

This page lists the version history of FileZilla Server releases. Have a look at the [changelog](changelog.php) for a detailed list of all changes committed to the source code repository.

### Select history:

[FileZilla Client](versions.php?type=client),
[FileZilla Server](versions.php?type=server)

### 1.9.4 (2024-11-11)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a regression causing the setting 'do not require authentication' to get lost when restarting the server. Note: To see the effect of this fix, administrators must manually reapply the 'do not require authentication' setting for affected users. After this adjustment, the setting will persist as expected.
* MSW: Added NETWORK\_SERVICE as a allowed user for the config dir ownership.

### 1.9.3 (2024-10-17)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a regression causing the automatic renewal of the Let's Encrypt® certificates to not work properly.
* UI: fixed regression causing the Administration Interface port of the last successful connection to not be properly restored.
* UI: fixed a bug where the TLS key appeared to be lost in the interface if certificate generation failed, even though the key was still retained on the server.

### 1.9.2 (2024-09-30)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed an issue with the update mechanism

### 1.9.1 (2024-09-09)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.0, the "public IP or hostname" field on the passive mode page was not restored when opening the settings dialog

### 1.9.0 (2024-09-06)

#### Fixed vulnerabilities:

* MSW: Warn if installing the server outside of Program Files due to custom directories having too lax permissions

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a race condition resulting in stalled connections
* \*nix: Fixed a potential crash if SIGINT is sent to the server while it is shutting down
* Fixes to the update check mechanism
* Fixed a regression in the converter for old 0.9.x configurations dealing with placeholders in native paths

### 1.9.0-rc1 (2024-08-08)

#### New features:

* Private keys used for TLS can now be stored on a PKCS#11-compatible token device; the UI has been updated accordingly.

* UI: added an FTP connection test, that can be reached directly from the Server menu item or executed at the end of the FTP Network Configuration Wizard.
* Made default values more secure, among which: require TLS on new FTP listeners, require a password for new users and warn if the administration password doesn't meet more stringent security requirements.
* Fixed bug causing the most recent log file, rather than the oldest, to be deleted upon rotation, when using dates as suffixes.
* MSW: fixed regression causing socket listener conflicts due to recent libfilezilla changes.
* Added WebUI: an HTTP server providing a REST API and a web app for seamless web access to stored files. WebUI is not included in the default build and must be enabled with the --enable-webui parameter during compilation. This feature is experimental; feedback and bug reports are welcome.

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* UI: the certificate fingerprint verification dialog is now sized to display the full fingerprint at once.
* UI: fixed bug causing the focus to be lost during user editing.
* UI: fixed bug causing the tray icon to display unexpectedly in certain cases.

* FileZilla Server now requires that the configuration directory is owned either by the operating system user account the server runs under, or a more privileged user (SYSTEM, Amdministrators, TrustedInstaller on Windows, root elsewhere)
* MSW: Mount points are now case-insensitive so that restrictions on sub mounts cannot be bypassed by a change of character case

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a potential deadlock during transfers
* FTP: Fixed potential crash if the session gets closed

### 1.8.1 (2024-01-25)

#### New features:

* Limits to the number of active sessions defined for the groups now apply to the group as a whole, not just to the individual users belonging to those groups.
* Fixed bug that led to timeouts not being set at startup, but only when changing the configuration.

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* FTP Server: NLST would report a file names with a leading ./ path in certain cases, which confused some clients. Fixed.

#### New features:

* UI: it is now possible to upload TLS certificates to the server directly from the UI, using a specific selector in the Security page of the protocols configuration.
* UI: the maximum amount of characters in all text controls has been limited to a sensible number, so to avoid potential crashes or stalls in corner cases.

In case of pre-existing conflicts in the configuration file, the administration listeners take precedence, so that it is still possible to change the FileZilla Server's configuration.
* UI: in some corner cases concurrently opening dialogs could cause instabilities. These dialogs are now queued up and opened sequentially.
* \*nix: fixed dependencies in the Debian installer
* \*nix: fixed installation directory of the icons

* Admin UI: Fixed switching from "Use system credentials to log in" to "Require a password to log in" not applying

### 1.5.0 (2022-07-20)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Admin UI: Connection dialog did not remember the last used port if there are multiple saved entries for the same hostname with different ports

### 1.5.0-rc1 (2022-07-12)

#### New features:

* Server: Implemented throttling of login attempts in case of too many failed attempts.
* Server: The version number in the welcome messsage can now be manually suppressed by setting the "has\_version" attribute of the message field in the configuration file to "false".
* MSW: If the service is running under the SYSTEM account, configuration files are now placed under %PROGRAMDATA%\filezilla-server. This is to workaround the issue that when doing a Windows Update the settings could be wiped out. Settings still residing under %LOCALAPPDATA%\filezilla-server are automatically migrated.
* Communication with the impersonator child process is now asynchronous
* Admin UI: The password fields in the configuration dialog now how show a hint to inform the user about how to keep the existing password

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Admin UI: Fixed a crash in listener editor
* Admin UI (macOS): Implemented workarounds for some wxWidgets glitches and malfunctions.
* Admin UI: The system\_user's name cannot be edited anymore (rightly so)
* Configuration data that cannot be serialized now prevents an incomplete output file from being written to disk
* Sudden deaths of the impersonator process no longer cause unintended behavior
* Fixed server crashes due to unexpected socket events in some corner cases

* \*nix: Added a filezilla-server-gui.desktop file, so that the Admin UI can easily be opened by desktop environments
* Maximum number of log file rotations has been reduced to a more sensible amount and the rotation algorithm has been changed to be more efficient

### 1.4.1 (2022-05-06)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Admin UI: Fixed a crash on the listener page
* Admin UI: Improved workflow for changing user passwords
* MSW: Fixed an issue with the converter for configurations from FileZilla Server 0.9.x

### 1.4.0 (2022-04-29)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Debian: by default the service is now configured to exclude headers from log lines, since journald outputs its own headers already.
* Mac: fixed regression that made the installed service not startable
* Admin UI: changed wording in the logging settings
* Admin UI: made default connection values correct, in case the settings file is missing.
* MSW: fixed various bug in the ExecDos plugin, that could cause the admin password not to be set properly.
* MSW: non-ASCII admin passwords can now be properly used.
* MSW: fixed a bug in libfilezilla that caused an unexpected failure when creating directories with restricted access. It had effects on the ACME account creation.

### 1.4.0-rc1 (2022-04-20)

#### Fixed vulnerabilities:

* MSW: the installer doesn't rely on the PATH environment variable to find the tools its needs, but refers to them absolutely, to avoid hijacking.

#### New features:

* The size of the TCP buffer sizes on the sockets used for data transfers can now be specified
* Configuration files are now tagged with a "flavour" and a version number. The Server will refuse to load configuration files with a different flavour than its own or with a version higher than its own. The server's option --config-version-check can be used to control this functionality: if specified, the server checks the versioning, performs the required action and then exit, unless its action is 'ignore'. If the action is 'error', it just checks whether the versions are ok. If the action is 'backup', then a backup of the files is made if the versions are not ok. The parameter --config-version-check-result-file is used to specify a file in which the result of the version check has to be put. If the file contains 'ok', then everything went file. If the file contains 'error', then there was an error. If the file contains 'backup', then a backup was made. The installer makes use of this functionality.
* Admin UI: the selected log entries can now be copied to the clipboard, in CSV, HTML and plaintext formats through the context menu
* Admin UI: the settings dialog layout has been changed to accomodate for future other protocol settings, factoring out the settings that are common to all protocols.
* Admin UI: adjusted borders and spacing to look better on HiDPI displays.
* Admin UI: preserve the fingerprints of the previously connected servers. The connection dialog gives hints when inputing the host and port.
* Log files can optionally be rotated daily instead of by size
* Added option to specify a default user to impersonate if a user logs in with an account that does not use impersonation

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* MSW: The installer not detects and rejects 32bit Windows
* MSW, Admin UI: No more double error message when a validation error occurs
* Admin UI: Solved a crash and fixed other bugs related to minimzing the main window to the notification area
* Server: --write-config option now also updates the users and groups configuration files
* Server: the log contains more detailed info about which configuration files have been saved
* Admin UI: the controller used for editing numbers now correctly accepts negative integers
* The network config wizard's text has been updated to be more explanatory and intuitive
* Self signed certificates don't require a 2nd level domain anymore
* Admin UI: the system user is now always at the top
* Admin UI: more meaningful message if the password is empty
* Admin UI: message dialogs now always have a reference to the top window
* FTP: QUIT needs to respond with 221, not 200
* Bug fixes to the internal HTTP library
* MSW: the installer now correctly displays the progress bar in all cases
* Fixed a confusing error message in some situations if trying to list non-existing directories

### 1.3.0 (2022-02-14)

#### New features:

* Configuration wizard to setup passive mode
* Linux: Warn if sysctl knob kernel.yama.ptrace\_scope is 0
* Linux: Refuse to run if sysctl knob fs.protected\_hardlinks is 0

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Admin UI: Rejecting a certificate fingerprint prompt no longer triggers automatic reconnects

### 1.3.0-rc1 (2022-02-03)

#### Fixed vulnerabilities:

* The internal tool filezilla-server-crypt now accepts the password from stdin, not anymore as a parameter, to avoid password leaking.
* Mountpoints are now impossible to rename or delete.

#### New features:

* The configuration files can now be reloaded without shutting down the service first. To make it work, send the SIGHUP signal to the service process on nix, send the paramchange control message to the service on Windows (i.e. 'sc control filezilla-server paramchange').
* The UI now automatically attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost
* MSW: users are now case-insensitive
* Mac: created an installer
* Display the administration TLS certificate fingerprints at installation time, so that they can be taken note of.
* Negotiate custom ALPN with FileZilla Client, this allows saving a few round-trips during connection establishment

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Warn if no administration password has been given during installation.
* In TVFS, fixed implicit root "/" not being accessible, trac #12617.
* In TVFS, an implicit mountpoint whose parent is non-recursive is now able to be listed and cwd'd into.
* Solved off-by-one bug in path normalization.
* Reported filesystem errors are permanent, hence use 5yz error codes rather than 4yz error codes in command replies.
* Permissions are now correctly updated in the UI when the current selected user changes.
* Fixed regressions in the UI related to the TLS certificates generation.

(TLS)/Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) heartbeat functionality in OpenSSL used in multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes from a connected client or server.      The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by implementing a malicious TLS or DTLS client, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected server, or a malicious TLS or DTLS server, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected client. The attacker could then send a specially-crafted TLS or DTLS heartbeat packet to the connected client or server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a limited portion of memory from a connected client or server for every heartbeat packet sent. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information that may include private keys and passwords.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0160      The criteria used to establish whether a Cisco product or service is vulnerable is solely whether it relies on an affected version of the OpenSSL library in order to implement a TLS/DTLS client or server. The criteria does not restrict the analysis to any specific set of protocols that the client or server may implement (eg: HTTPS, SMTP, EAP, etc.).   Based on this criteria the products that are listed in this security advisory as not vulnerable are such no matter which attack vector an attacker may attempt to use to exploit Heartbleed.       The Cupid attack exploits the Heartbleed bug using the EAP protocol as an attack vector to target the TLS layer in EAP-TLS. The products that are listed in this security advisory that are not vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability are also unaffected by the Cupid attack.      The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product.      Given the unique characteristics of the Heartbleed vulnerability, Cisco recommends customers to generate new public/private key pairs, obtain a new certificate for that key pair, and install the new certificate and associated key pair as appropriate on all affected deployments after installing the software updates. This is general advice appropriate for Cisco and non-Cisco devices.      For Cisco products, please refer to the information provided in the Cisco bug IDs, listed in the Affected Products section of this document. Additional information and detailed instructions on how to perform those tasks are available on the Cisco installation, configuration and maintenance guides for each product. If additional clarification or advice is needed, please contact your support organization.   **Product Specific Information****Cisco Meraki** Cisco has made available additional information in the following document: <https://meraki.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/openssl-and-the-heartbleed-vulnerability/> **Small Cell factory recovery root filesystem** The following products leverage the Small cell factory recovery root filesystem V2.99.4 or later. The factory recovery root filesystem is not stored in flash but is downloaded from Cisco USC CloudBase and only used for the duration of the activation/recovery process. OpenSSL is called by the cURL application, which is itself called from a shell script so a malicious user would have no exposure to any Cisco proprietary code and the memory space of the cURL process would not contain any private keys:    + DPH-SO16 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FAPE-HSP-5620 (OEM)   + FAPO-HSP-5900 (OEM)   + FAPR-HSP-5110 (OEM)   + FC1020 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC1021 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC1022 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC1060 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC1080 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC170U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC173U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC233U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC235U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FC270U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FEMTO-G3 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FEMTOAP-SR1 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FEMTOAP-SR2 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + FMA16301T (OEM)   + FP16201 (OEM)   + FP8101 (OEM)   + FP8131T (OEM)   + FPA16241T (OEM)   + FPLUS2 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + G5 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + G6 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + S2000 (OEM)   + SH170U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + SH173U (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + USC3331 (Cisco)   + USC5310 (Cisco)   + USC5330 (Cisco)   + USC7330 (Cisco)   + USC9330 (Cisco)   + ZM-000-05-0005 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-000-05EU-0004 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-000-07EU-0001 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-001-03EU-0003 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-001-03EU-0005 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-001-03EU-0006 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   + ZP-005-02EU-0002 (Cisco, formerly Ubiquisys)   **Cisco Universal Small Cell 5000 Series and Cisco Universal Small Cell 7000 Series** A malicious user cannot get the private key of the Universal Small Cell (USC) product as the private keys are held in a separate protected memory space; however, the malicious user may be able to access memory containing the Small Cell internal O&M database and configuration details. **Cisco Collaboration Systems 10.x:** Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) version 10.0, Cisco Unity Connection (UC) version 10.0, and Cisco Unified Presence Server (CUPS) version 10.0 are affected by the OpenSSL vulnerability described in this advisory. An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to open a TCP connection to an affected port may exploit the vulnerability. Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.      Cisco voice and presence devices open a number of service ports to accept connections from users, administrators, phones, and IP voice gateways. A majority of these services are secured utilizing SSL or TLS and may be leveraged by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. **Cisco Unified IP Phones:** Cisco Unified 7800 Series, Cisco Unified 8961, Cisco Unified 9951, and Cisco Unified 9971 IP Phones may be exposed to the vulnerability when the secure Web Management interface is enabled. Additionally, attacks may be executed via secure SIP and secure RTP.      An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to reach the Web Management interface when enabled, or that can place a direct secure SIP call to the device may trigger the vulnerability. Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.      Voice networks that have been deployed using Cisco Secure Configuration Guidelines are at a reduced risk from outside attackers. Phones that have been segmented from the common use network should restrict the attack surface to other phones and users who have direct access to the voice network. **Cisco Desktop Collaboration Experience:** Cisco Desktop Collaboration Experience DX650 devices may be exposed via the secure Web Management Interface when enabled. These devices may also be exploited via secure SIP, secure RTP, as well as any other application installed on the device that utilizes the system-supplied OpenSSL library.      An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to reach the Web Management interface when enabled can place a direct secure SIP call to the device, or access an affected service may trigger the vulnerability. Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.      Voice networks that have been deployed using Cisco Secure Configuration Guidelines are at a reduced risk from outside attackers. Phones that have been segmented from the common use network should restrict the attack surface to other phones and users who have direct access to the voice network. **Voice Networks Security Hardening Guidelines:** Cisco provides a comprehensive design guide for all voice network deployments. This includes suggested security feature configurations on intermediate and edge devices to prevent spoofed traffic from being passed on the voice network as well as the isolation and segregation of voice traffic from general network traffic.

Workarounds  * Cisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability:   <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ERP-Heartbleed.html>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      This section will be updated when information about fixed software versions is available.      **Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for iOS** Fixed in version 3.0.09353 and available for download on the App Store for devices running iOS version 6 or 7. **Cisco WebEx Meetings Server** Fixed in version 2.0MR2 **Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)** Fixed in version X7.2.3 and X8.1.1 **Cisco Expressway Series** Fixed in version X8.1.1 **Cisco FireAMP Private Cloud Virtual Appliance** Fixed in version 1.0.20140409      **After the update:**   In order to further secure the Private Cloud instance, it is recommended that customers, after having completed the software update, replace any existing certificates on the appliance:      Customers using certificates other than self-signed certificates should procure and install new certificates. Those certificates should be generated using a new private/public key pair. Customer should NOT reuse the previous public/private keypair. Once replaced, putting the device in and out of maintenance mode will ensure that the new certificates are loaded.      Customers using the default self-signed certificates should generate new certificates after performing the FireAMP Private Cloud update by executing the following commands:    ```   amp-ctl maintenance enable   amp-ctl regenerate-ssl-certs   amp-ctl maintenance disable      ```   This will regenerate the SSL certificates and restart all of the services.      Additionally, customers should reset all passwords (opadmin and fireamp console) and perform a review of the audit logs in both portals. **Cisco SourceFire** Cisco SourceFire 3D Appliances (running release 4.10.x and 5.x up to 5.3) and Cisco SourceFire SSL appliances are not vulnerable to this issue. These appliances run the 0.9.8 branch of OpenSSL which is not affected by this vulnerability.      For additional information regarding detection, please visit the [VRT blog](http://vrt-blog.snort.org/). If you have any questions, please contact Sourcefire Technical Support. **Small Cell Factory Recovery root Filesystem** Fixed software has been deployed to the Cisco USC CloudBase for all FAPs, except the following Products, which are currently in the planning phases of being updated: FPLUS2-000X, G5-000X, G6-000X Series, FEMTOAP-SR1-000X and FEMTOAP-SR2-000X.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=13148#c0)  David Walser    2014-04-04 18:00:02 CEST  ``` OpenSuSE has issued an advisory today (April 4): <http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2014-04/msg00007.html>  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated openssl packages fix security vulnerability:  The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL through 1.0.0l does not ensure that certain swap operations have a constant-time behavior, which makes it easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack (CVE-2014-0076).

Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4.  Advisory: ========================  Updated openssl packages fix security vulnerability:  The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL through 1.0.0l does not ensure that certain swap operations have a constant-time behavior, which makes it easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack (CVE-2014-0076).  A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension in OpenSSL through 1.0.1f can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server (CVE-2014-0160).
