Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-0160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2014-0160, also known as "Heartbleed," is a missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension within the OpenSSL library. This allows an attacker to request a larger response than intended, leading to a read beyond buffer boundaries and the potential exposure of sensitive information stored in the server's memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing bounds check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper size validation when processing heartbeat extension requests.
*   **Memory Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary data from the server's memory.
*   **OpenSSL Implementation Flaw:** The vulnerability is located within the OpenSSL cryptographic library, specifically in its implementation of the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of information:** The primary impact is the disclosure of potentially sensitive information stored in the server's memory. This could include:
    *   Private keys used for SSL/TLS encryption.
    *   User credentials (usernames and passwords).
    *   Session data (cookies).
    *   Other sensitive data handled by the affected services.
    *   Collateral memory that can be used for further attacks.
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requiring no authentication to initiate the attack.
*   **Potential for impersonation:** Leaked secret keys enable attackers to impersonate legitimate servers and eavesdrop on or modify encrypted communications.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some HP advisories also mentioned the vulnerability leading to a remote DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based attacks:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted heartbeat requests over the network to a server or client using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
*   **Client-side attacks:** If a client-side application is affected, a malicious server can potentially exploit the client by sending crafted heartbeat responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish network communication with the targeted service or client.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation doesn't require prior authentication or access to valid credentials.
*   **Basic Tooling:** Exploit code is readily available making it relatively easy for an attacker to perform the memory read.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f, and 1.0.2-beta.
*   The vulnerability was present in OpenSSL for approximately two years, between the introduction of the heartbeat extension in March 2012 and the release of a fix on April 7, 2014.
*   The "Heartbleed" vulnerability is used as a name because the TLS heartbeat feature allows an attacker to make requests to a server, essentially making it "bleed" information from its memory.
*   Multiple sources mention that the bug was independently found by the Codenomicon team and Neel Mehta of Google Security.
*   Several sources describe the bug as easy to exploit remotely and without leaving traces in system logs.

*   Nodejs packages shipped in Red Hat Software Collections 1, Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1, Fedora and EPEL.
*   Node.js source code

**Mitigation and Resolution:**

*   **Upgrade OpenSSL:** The primary resolution involves upgrading OpenSSL to a non-vulnerable version (1.0.1g or later). This action should be done as soon as possible.
*   **Recompile with -DOPENSSL\_NO\_HEARTBEATS:** Alternatively, the OpenSSL library can be recompiled to disable the vulnerable heartbeat feature.
*   **Revoke and Regenerate Keys and Certificates:** It's crucial to regenerate all keys and certificates that were generated by or used on vulnerable systems and also to revoke old certificates.
*   **Change Passwords and Invalidate Sessions:**  All passwords that may have been exposed to this vulnerability need to be reset and session keys and cookies invalidated.
*   **Use secure private networks:** Restrict network access to sensitive systems to private management networks.
*   **Disable the affected service:** If upgrades are not immediately possible, disabling the affected services is also suggested by some vendors.
*   **Use PFS:** Implement Perfect Forward Secrecy when possible.

**Note:** Multiple sources emphasize that just updating OpenSSL is not enough; other steps such as those to regenerate keys and certificates, and invalidate sessions should also be taken.
