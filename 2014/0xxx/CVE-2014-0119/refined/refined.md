Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper constraints on the class loader used to access the XML parser with an XSLT stylesheet. This allowed a malicious web application to replace the XML parser used by Tomcat for processing XSLTs, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs), and tag plugin configuration files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) injection:** By injecting a malicious XML parser, an attacker could bypass limits on XML external entities.
*   **Classloader manipulation:** The vulnerability allows for manipulation of the classloader used for XML parsing in Tomcat.
*  **Information Disclosure:** A malicious application could then gain access to XML files processed by other web applications deployed on the same Tomcat instance or read arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read arbitrary files on the server or access XML files from other web applications running on the same Tomcat instance.
*   **Security Manager Bypass:** The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities, potentially leading to other attacks.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution:**  (As noted in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry) - The ability to read and alter XML files combined with the ability to access external entities could potentially be chained to RCE
*  **Limited DoS:** While not the primary focus of this CVE, some of the changes to address the vulnerability included memory leak fixes, related to XML parsing which could also have caused a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious web application deployed on a vulnerable Tomcat instance.
*   The web application would need to provide an XML external entity declaration along with an entity reference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deploy a malicious web application on the target Tomcat server.
*   The attacker would not need to authenticate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Apache Tomcat versions 6.x before 6.0.41 and 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.5.
*   The fix involves multiple code changes related to XML parsing, including modifications to `SecurityClassLoad.java`, `DefaultServlet.java`, `TldConfig.java`, and `ParserUtils.java`, and `JspDocumentParser.java`.
*   The vulnerability affected JBoss Web (a component of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform) as well.
*   The fix includes defensive coding and ensuring the correct values of `blockExternal` are used.
