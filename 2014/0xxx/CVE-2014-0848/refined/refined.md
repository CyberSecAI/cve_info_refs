- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default configuration of the Apache web server used by IBM Netezza Performance Portal includes weak SSL ciphers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Usage of weak SSL ciphers. The default `SSLCipherSuite` value includes `RC4+RSA` which is considered weak, and allows potentially insecure connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on or manipulate encrypted communications between clients and the Netezza Performance Portal due to the weak encryption algorithms.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting the vulnerable web server's SSL/TLS configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
