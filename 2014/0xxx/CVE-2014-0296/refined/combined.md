## Vulnerability in Remote Desktop Could Allow Tampering (2969259)

Published: June 10, 2014 | Updated: October 2, 2014

**Version:** 1.3

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow tampering if an attacker gains access to the same network segment as the targeted system during an active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session, and then sends specially crafted RDP packets to the targeted system. By default, RDP is not enabled on any Windows operating system. Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by strengthening the encryption used by the Remote Desktop Protocol. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Which editions of Windows 7 are affected?**

Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows 7 are affected. All supported editions of Windows 7 are affected if RDP 8.0 is installed on the system. For customers running RDP 8.0 on local systems who do not need the new server-side features provided in RDP 8.0, Microsoft recommends upgrading to RDP 8.1 and not applying (or removing) the 2965788 update.

**Are there any prerequisites for installing the 2965788 update on Windows 7 systems?**

No. There are no prerequisites for installing the 2965788 update on affected Windows 7 systems. However, if you install the Remote Desktop (RDP) 8.0 update (2592687) after installing the 2965788 update, then you will be reoffered the 2965788 update.

**There are multiple updates listed for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Do I need to install both updates?**

No. Depending on how your system is configured to receive updates, only one of the updates for a given edition of Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 will apply.

For systems running Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2:

* The 2965788 update is for systems that already have the 2919355 update installed.
* The 2966034 update is for systems without the 2919355 update installed. Note that the 2966034 update is only available for customers managing updates using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Windows Intune, or System Center Configuration Manager.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an , Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## RDP MAC Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0296

A tampering vulnerability exists in the Remote Desktop Protocol. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to modify the traffic content of an active RDP session.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0296](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0296).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the Remote Desktop Protocol is not enabled on any Windows operating system. Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk.
* On Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 systems, Network Level Authentication (NLA), which helps prevent exploitation from this vulnerability, is enabled by default when the Remote Desktop host is enabled.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems connected directly to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Ensure that Network Level Authentication is enabled on systems running supported editions of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2969259](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2969259) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable this workaround.

  You can enable Network Level Authentication to block unauthenticated attackers from exploiting this vulnerability. With Network Level Authentication turned on, an attacker would first need to authenticate to Remote Desktop Services using a valid account on the target system before the attacker could exploit the vulnerability.

  In order to use Network Level Authentication, your environment must meet the following requirements:

  + The client computer must be using at least Remote Desktop Connection 6.0.
  + The client computer must be using an operating system, such as Windows 7 or Windows Vista that supports the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol.
  + The RD Session Host server must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008.

  To configure Network Level Authentication for a connection, perform the following steps:

  1. On the RD Session Host server, open **Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration**. To open Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration, click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, point to **Remote Desktop Services**, and then click **Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration**.
  2. Under **Connections**, right-click the name of the connection, and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, select the **Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication** check box.

     If the **Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication** check box is selected and is not enabled, the **Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication** Group Policy setting has been enabled and has been applied to the RD Session Host server.
  4. Click **OK**.

  **Impact of workaround.** Client computers that do not support Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol will not be able to access servers protected with Network Level Authentication.

  For more information regarding Network Level Authentication, including how to enable Network Level Authentication using Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Configure Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services Connections](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc732713.aspx).

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a tampering vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Remote Desktop does not use robust encryption for an RDP session.

**What is the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)?**

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) lets users create a virtual session on their desktop computers. RDP allows remote users to access all of the data and applications on their computers. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383015%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**Is remote desktop enabled by default?**

No, RDP for administration is not enabled by default. However, customers who have not enabled RDP will still be offered this update in order to help ensure the protection of their systems. For more information regarding this configuration setting, see the TechNet article, [How to enable and to configure Remote Desktop for Administration in Windows Server 2003](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/814590).

**What is Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services?**

Network Level Authentication is an authentication method that can be used to enhance RD Session Host server security by requiring that the user be authenticated to the RD Session Host server before a session is created. For more information regarding Network Level Authentication, please see the TechNet article, [Configure Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services Connections](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc732713.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could not only disclose information by reading RDP information during an active session, but also modify the information as well.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by first gaining access to the same network segment as the targeted system during an active RDP session, and then sending specially crafted RDP packets to the targeted system.

For systems running supported editions of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2 with Network Level Authentication turned off, a remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets to the target system. Turning on Network Level Authentication helps prevent the vulnerability from being exploited on these systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Terminal servers are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk. Additionally, systems running supported editions of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2 that have Network Level Authentication enabled are at reduced risk as an attacker would first need to be authenticated to the service.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by strengthening the encryption used by the Remote Desktop Protocol.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, see [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
