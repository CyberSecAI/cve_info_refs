How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services Could Allow Information Disclosure (2916036)

Published: February 11, 2014 | Updated: February 28, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft XML Core Services included in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker would have no way to force users to view specially crafted content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to an attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

This security update is rated Important for affected Windows clients and rated Low for affected Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that MSXML verifies same-origin policy of URLs. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## MSXML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0266

An information disclosure vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to read files on the local file system of a user, or read content of web domains where a user is currently authenticated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when a user views specially crafted web content that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0266](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0266).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use scripting to exploit this vulnerability. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent MSXML 3.0 binary behaviors from being used in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to use a specific binary behavior in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the behavior in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To set the kill bits for CLSIDs with value of {f5078f39-c551-11d3-89b9-0000f81fe221} and {f6d90f16-9c73-11d3-b32e-00c04f990bb4}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  ```
      Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{f5078f39-c551-11d3-89b9-0000f81fe221}]
      "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{f5078f39-c551-11d3-89b9-0000f81fe221}]
      "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

      Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{f6d90f16-9c73-11d3-b32e-00c04f990bb4}]
      "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{f6d90f16-9c73-11d3-b32e-00c04f990bb4}]
      "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

  ```

You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy Collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

| Note: |
| --- |
| You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect. |

**Impact of workaround**. Websites that use the XMLHTTP 3.0 ActiveX controls may no longer display or function correctly in Internet Explorer.

**How to undo the workaround.** Delete the registry keys previously added in implementing this workaround.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

| Note: |
| --- |
| If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**. |

| Note: |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High. |

**Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

| Note: |
| --- |
| Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly. |

**Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

| Note: |
| --- |
| Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are \***.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and \***.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.\ |

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, allowing an attacker to access content from different domains.

**What are cross-domain and zone policy in Internet Explorer?**

Before an XMLHTTP request is sent, the URL of the hosting page is compared to the URL in the [open](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms536648) method to determine if the URLs are in the same domain. If not, the request is handled according to the policy of the [security zone](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537183) in which the request originates. For more information, see [About Native XMLHTTP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537505).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read files on the local file system of the user or read content of web domains where the user is currently authenticated.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted website that is designed to invoke MSXML through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that MSXML verifies same-origin policy of URLs.

| Note: |
| --- |
| After applying this update, customers may find that some webpages no longer render properly in Internet Explorer. This could be because access is being denied to the webpages due to cross-domain and zone policy. The MSXML-XMLHTTP component is used to determine the policy for cross-domain access across zones. For example, a trusted site can access data from a site in the Intranet zone, while the reverse is always denied. For more information, see [About Native XMLHTTP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537505). |

If you trust and wish to view such webpages, you can configure Internet Explorer to allow you to view the webpages. For more information on configuring Internet Explorer after installing this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2916036](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2916036).
