Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0266:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) verifies the same-origin policy of URLs. Specifically, it fails to properly enforce cross-domain policies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper enforcement of cross-domain policies within MSXML. This allows a violation of the same-origin policy, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read files on the local file system of a user.
- An attacker could also read the content of web domains where a user is currently authenticated, gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage.
- Attackers would need to host this malicious webpage on a compromised site, a site accepting user-provided content or advertisements.
- Attackers could also send the malicious webpage via email attachments or links.
- The user needs to be tricked into visiting the malicious page (typically through links in emails or IM messages, or by opening email attachments).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need the ability to host or inject specially crafted web content onto a website or distribute it through email.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage.
- No special user privileges are needed on the victim's machine.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0. Versions 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 are not affected.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows client systems and "Low" for Windows server systems due to the Enhanced Security Configuration in place on servers by default.
- This vulnerability was publicly disclosed and was being exploited in targeted attacks at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The security update corrects the way that MSXML verifies the same-origin policy of URLs.
- There are several workarounds to mitigate this issue before the security update is applied, such as disabling the MSXML 3.0 binary behaviors in Internet Explorer, setting the security settings for the Internet and Local Intranet zone to High, and disabling Active Scripting.
- Some websites may no longer render properly in Internet Explorer after applying this update due to cross-domain and zone policy enforcement.
