- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - On Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of information from kernel memory. While it wouldn't directly allow code execution or privilege escalation, the leaked information could be used in further attempts to compromise the system.
  - On Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1, successful exploitation could cause the target system to stop responding (Denial of Service).
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
