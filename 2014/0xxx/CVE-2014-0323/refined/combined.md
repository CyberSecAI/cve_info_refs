## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2930275)

Published: March 11, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0300

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0300](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0300).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.

**What is the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)?**

Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode device driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What is the Windows kernel?**

The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to elevate privileges.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0323

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.
