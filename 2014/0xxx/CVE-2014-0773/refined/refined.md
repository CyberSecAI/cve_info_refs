Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-0773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'). The `CreateProcess` method in the `BWOCXRUN.BwocxrunCtrl.1` control has a bypassable validation, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application attempts to validate user-supplied commands before execution using `strstr` to check for specific strings (`\setup.exe`, `\bwvbprt.exe`, or `\bwvbprtl.exe`). However, this validation can be bypassed, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system. This includes the ability to run remote files using UNC paths.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker provides a command string that bypasses the validation implemented in the `CreateProcess` method. The validation uses `strstr` to check for specific strings. The bypass allows the attacker to execute arbitrary command lines, including those pointing to remote files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote network access to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess application.
- Low skill level to craft a command that bypasses the string validation.
