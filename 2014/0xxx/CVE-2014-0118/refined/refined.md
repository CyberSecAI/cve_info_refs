Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents, focusing on CVE-2014-0118:

**1. Vulnerability Description**
   - **Root cause:** A resource consumption flaw exists in the `mod_deflate` module of the Apache HTTP Server.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability arises from the way `mod_deflate` handles request body decompression when configured with the `DEFLATE` input filter. It does not limit the amount of memory consumed when decompressing a request body.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a request with a specially crafted, highly compressed body. This could lead to excessive consumption of system memory and CPU resources.
   - **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker is a remote user, with the ability to send HTTP requests to a server using mod_deflate with request body decompression enabled (which is not a default configuration).

**2. Technical Details and Descriptions**
   -  The vulnerability is present in the `mod_deflate` module, specifically in how it handles the request body when the "DEFLATE" input filter is enabled.
   -  The core issue is a lack of limits on decompression, which allows an attacker to craft a compressed request body that expands to an extremely large size when decompressed, leading to resource exhaustion on the server.
    - The issue was found in versions prior to 2.4.10 and 2.2.29 of the Apache HTTP Server, impacting OS X, Mageia, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, among others.
   - The fix involved setting limits for inflated request bodies via the new directives:
      - `DeflateInflateLimitRequestBody`: A limit on the size of the inflated input
      - `DeflateInflateRatioLimit`: Set a ratio limit above which inflation is aborted
      - `DeflateInflateRatioBurst`: Maximum number of following inflate ratios above the limit
    - The fix is implemented by using the zlib library and setting size and compression limits, and detecting errors from Zlib calls
    - The fix also prevents a crash on memory exhaustion, setting a warning message if limits are reached
  - Some older uses of the 'AddType' directive need to be ported to 'SetHandler' after the fix.

**3. Affected Systems:**
   - OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.2
    - Apache HTTP Server versions prior to 2.4.10 and 2.2.29
     - Mageia 3 and 4
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 5, 6, and 7

**4. Affected Components**
   - Apache HTTP Server `mod_deflate` module

**5. Mitigation**
    -  Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.10 or 2.2.29 or later where the fixes were implemented.
    - As a temporary workaround, disabling request body decompression or restricting access to it may reduce risk (but is not recommended as a long-term solution).
    - Update configuration to use SetHandler instead of AddType where applicable

**6. Impact (as described in source materials)**
   - Denial of service due to excessive consumption of memory and CPU resources on the target system.
   - Potential for crashes, or execution of arbitrary code on systems with insufficient protection.
   - The severity is generally considered "moderate" or "important", but depends on platform and specific configuration.

**7. Additional Notes:**
    - Patches are provided by multiple vendors, including Apple, Debian, Red Hat, and Mageia.
    - Upstream fixes have been committed to the Apache HTTP Server repository and are described in specific revisions provided by the document.
    - The vulnerability was reported by Giancarlo Pellegrino and Davide Balzarotti.
