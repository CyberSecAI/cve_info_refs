- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM MessageSight server only checks the first 8 characters of a password, thus ignoring any subsequent characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate password validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can bypass security and gain control over the appliance.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated (has valid username), but the system only checks the first 8 characters of the password, which effectively bypasses security.
