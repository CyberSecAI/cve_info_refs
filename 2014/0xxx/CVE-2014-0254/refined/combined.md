## TCP/IP Version 6 (IPv6) Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0254

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Windows in the IPv6 implementation of TCP/IP. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0254](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0254).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker's system must belong to the same subnet as the target system.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. Affected systems that allow any IP connections to the Internet may be vulnerable to this issue.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the Router Discovery Protocol**

  If the Router Discovery Protocol is enabled, use the following workaround to disable it. This will help prevent attempts to exploit the TCP/IP Version 6 (IPv6) Denial of Service Vulnerability.

  Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
      netsh interface ipv6 set interface "InterfaceName" routerdiscovery=disabled

  ```

  **Impact of workaround**. Router discovery will be disabled.

  **How to undo the workaround**.

  Run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh interface ipv6 set interface "InterfaceName" routerdiscovery=enabled

  ```
* **Disable Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)**

  You can disable IPv6 on the host through the **DisabledComponents** registry value. The **DisabledComponents** registry value affects all network interfaces on the host. For more information about disabling IPv6 components, see [How to disable IP version 6 or its specific components in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852).

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To disable certain IPv6 components yourself, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, type **regedit**, and then select the **regedit** app.
  2. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.
  3. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:
     **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\**
  4. Double-click DisabledComponents to change the DisabledComponents entry.

  **Note** If the **DisabledComponents** entry is unavailable, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
  2. Type **DisabledComponents**, and then press **ENTER**.
  3. Double-click **DisabledComponents**.
  4. To disable all IPv6 interfaces except for the IPv6 loopback interface, type **0x11**.

  **How to undo the workaround**.

  1. Click Start, type regedit, and then select the regedit app.
  2. In the User Account Control dialog box, click Yes.
  3. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:
     **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\**
  4. Double-click DisabledComponents to change the DisabledComponents entry.
  5. Type 0 to enable all IPv6 components.
* **Disable the "Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" inbound firewall rule**

  To disable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=No

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** ICMPv6 router advertisements will be blocked. This could adversely impact IPv6 functionality in common deployment scenarios, where router discovery protocol is used for host configuration.

  **How to undo the workaround**.

  To re-enable this firewall rule, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-In)" dir=in new enable=Yes

  ```

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected operating systems perform incomplete validation of TCP/IP network packets. The vulnerability is caused when an attacker sends large amounts of specially crafted IPv6 router advertisement packets over a targeted subnet. This attack can cause denial of service on any machines belonging to the same subnet.

**What is IPv6?**

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a suite of standard protocols for the network layer of the Internet that replaces IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 is built into Microsoft Windows XP and later. IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems of the IPv4 such as address depletion, security, autoconfiguration, and extensibility. To learn more about IPv6, see [IPv6 for Microsoft: Frequently Asked Questions](https://technet.microsoft.com/network/cc987595.aspx).

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739443).

**What are Router Advertisements?**

Router Advertisements allow routers to instruct hosts how to perform address autoconfiguration. For example, routers can specify whether hosts should use DHCPv6 and/or autonomous (stateless) address configuration. Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a router solicitation message. Router Advertisements contain prefixes that are used for determining whether another address shares the same link (on-link determination) and/or address configuration, a suggested hop limit value, etc. For more information about Router Advertisements and Neighbor Discovery in IPv6, see [RFC 4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause affected systems to stop responding.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a large number of specially crafted IPv6 packets and sending the packets to affected systems over a subnet network. The packets could then cause the affected systems to stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate TCP/IP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-0254](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0254).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers using IPv6 when this security bulletin was originally issued.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
