{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "During state load, the `config_len` value is read from the savevm data and used to allocate a buffer, and copy data to it. An attacker can control this value by manipulating the savevm data, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Altering savevm data on disk",
      "Altering savevm data during migration"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to modify the savevm data. This could be achieved by controlling a compromised guest or by intercepting and modifying the data during migration.",
    "cve": "CVE-2014-0182"
  }
