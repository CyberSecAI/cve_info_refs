Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the RICOS fat client performing input validation only on the client-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Client-side input validation: The application relies on the client to enforce input restrictions instead of performing server-side validation, which can be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data manipulation: An attacker can alter arbitrary data, potentially creating a limit, altering the username of the created limit, and confirming the limit themselves.
- Dual control bypass: Attackers can circumvent dual control mechanisms advertised by RICOS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulation of serialized objects: The attacker manipulates data sent by the fat client before it reaches the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept and modify data transmitted by the fat client.
- Knowledge of how data is serialized and structured.
