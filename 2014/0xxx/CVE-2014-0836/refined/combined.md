# ADV: IBM QRadar SIEM

*From*: Thomas Pollet <thomas.pollet () gmail com>

```
Hello,

Copy/paste from
[http://thomaspollet.blogspot.be/2014/01/ibm-qradar-siem-csrf-xss-mitm-rce.html:](http://thomaspollet.blogspot.be/2014/01/ibm-qradar-siem-csrf-xss-mitm-rce.html%3A)

IBM QRadar SIEM CSRF - XSS - MITM - RCE
I have found the IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform auto update
mechanisms exposes a number of security bugs.

Web Interface Sreenshot (/console/do/qradar/autoupdateConsole)
<<http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-59tEPlAPaQM/UuJIL7p-oZI/AAAAAAAAAhw/Vz8iHxWG60M/s1600/qupdate.PNG>>

   - The autoupdateConsole doesn't check for cross site request forgery
   - Input to the autoupdateConsole proxyUsername field is not sanitized,
   therefore it is possible to inject html into the web interface
   - The autoupdate mechanism doesn't check ssl certificates before
   downloading the updates
   - The autoupdate mechanism downloads a file scripts/script_list which
   contains a list of files together with their hash. The autoupdate process
   then tries to verify the hash but doing so, it doesn't escape shell
   characters. This way it is possible to execute commands. For example, the
   appliance will reboot if the script_list contains an entry

372e25f23b5a8ae33c7ba203412ace30  $(reboot)

   - The autoupdate mechanism runs as root

Regards,
Thomas

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
