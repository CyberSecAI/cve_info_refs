Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0132:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents, particularly the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2014:0292 and the Bugzilla entry 1074845, directly reference CVE-2014-0132, confirming relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the 389 Directory Server's improper handling of the `authzid` parameter during SASL-based authentication, specifically with the GSSAPI mechanism. The server did not properly validate the provided `authzid` against the actual credentials presented.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Authorization:** The vulnerability allowed a user who had authenticated with one Kerberos principal to bind to the directory using a different, unauthorized Kerberos principal specified in the `authzid`.
- **Missing Validation:** The server was missing necessary checks to ensure the user requesting the bind was actually authorized to use the specified `authzid`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This weakness allowed an attacker to effectively impersonate any user within the directory, including the administrative Directory Manager.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could have the following impacts:

- **Full Access:** An attacker could gain full access to the directory server.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could read any data stored within the directory.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify configuration values and user data.
- **System Compromise:** By obtaining administrative privileges, the attacker could effectively compromise the entire directory service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **SASL/GSSAPI Authentication:** The attack vector is through the LDAP protocol using the SASL/GSSAPI authentication mechanism.
- **`authzid` Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the manipulation of the `authzid` parameter within the SASL bind request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the 389 Directory Server.
- **Valid Kerberos Principal:** The attacker needs a valid Kerberos principal to initiate the SASL/GSSAPI bind.
- **Knowledge of Target `authzid`:** The attacker needs to know the `authzid` of the user they want to impersonate.

**Additional Information (from the provided content):**

*   **Patch:** A patch was developed and applied to address the issue.  The patch was backported to multiple versions of 389-ds-base (1.2.11, 1.3.1, and 1.3.2).
*   **Affected Products:** The advisory specifies the affected products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6 and its various derivatives.
*   **Resolution:** Red Hat issued security advisory RHSA-2014:0292 to address this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading the affected 389-ds-base packages is the primary mitigation strategy.
* **CVSS:** Red Hat uses the CVSSv3 scoring system to help customers prioritize remediation efforts.
*  **Fix Verification**: The fix was confirmed in multiple Linux distributions including Fedora and EPEL.

In summary, CVE-2014-0132 was a privilege escalation vulnerability in the 389 Directory Server that stemmed from improper handling of the authzid parameter in SASL/GSSAPI authentication. Exploitation allowed an attacker with a valid Kerberos principal to impersonate any other user, potentially gaining full administrative control over the directory service.  Patches were released by Red Hat and the upstream 389-ds-base project to remediate this vulnerability.
