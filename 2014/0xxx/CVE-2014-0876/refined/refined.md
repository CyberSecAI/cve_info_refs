- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A local vulnerability in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client can cause the crash or hang of certain Java GUI functions. The specific technical details of the vulnerability are not provided.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies within the TSM client's Java GUI component. It leads to a crash or hang of the GUI when specific operations are performed within affected versions of the TSM client.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to denial of service conditions via a crash or hang of the TSM client's Java GUI. This would prevent users from managing or monitoring the TSM client through the GUI, and any related dependent tasks, and may lead to data loss if not configured correctly.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with certain functions of the Java GUI. This implies that the attacker needs local access to the client machine running the vulnerable TSM client software and must be able to utilize the Java GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the TSM client machine and must be able to interact with the GUI.
