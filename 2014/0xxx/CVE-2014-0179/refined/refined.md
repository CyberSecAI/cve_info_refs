Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0179:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The root cause is that `libvirt` was using the `XML_PARSE_NOENT` flag when parsing XML documents with the `libxml2` library. This flag instructs `libxml2` to expand all entities present within the XML document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability stems from the unsafe parsing of XML documents, which allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection. By crafting an XML document with a malicious external entity definition, an attacker can leverage `libvirt` to process the entity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the crafted XML document points to a special file that blocks when read, the `libvirtd` process can be made to hang indefinitely, leading to a denial of service condition.
*   **Arbitrary File Read (Information Disclosure):** In environments where fine-grained access control is enabled, the attacker can potentially use this flaw to read arbitrary files from the host system. This could lead to information disclosure if sensitive files are accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the `libvirtd` daemon to hang, making the virtualization service unavailable.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read sensitive files on the host system, potentially exposing passwords or other confidential data (only if fine-grained access control is enabled).

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Input:** An attacker needs to find a way to force libvirt to parse a maliciously crafted XML document. This could involve an attacker crafting a specially designed XML document and then attempting to use some libvirt API that allows them to use that XML document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to trigger XML parsing:** An attacker needs a method to force libvirt to parse a specially crafted XML document.  This requires the ability to interact with an API of libvirt that accepts XML and is also exploitable.
*   **For Arbitrary File Read (Information Disclosure):** Fine-grained access control mechanism needs to be enabled for this attack vector.  Without it, only DoS is possible.
*   **For Denial of Service (DoS):** No special privileges needed but the attacker needs to cause the libvirtd to parse an XML document with an entity pointing to a special file that blocks on read access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `libvirt` prior to the fix.
*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the usage of `XML_PARSE_NOENT` flag in `libxml2` library.
*   The fix involves preventing the expansion of XML entities when parsing XML documents.
*   The vulnerability impacts Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7, Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 14.04, and openSUSE 12.3, 13.1 and Fedora.
