Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input when registering systems in Katello. Specifically, HTML code included within a system's name is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. When a system is registered with a malicious HTML payload in its name, this HTML is stored. Subsequently, when the system information page is viewed, this malicious HTML gets rendered within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into a system's name. When an administrator views the system information page, this malicious code is executed in their browser.
- This could lead to various impacts:
    - Session hijacking by stealing session cookies.
    - Phishing attacks by redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    - Modification of the displayed content.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker registers a system with Katello, including malicious HTML/JavaScript within the system name field.
- Any user who views the system information page for that particular system will trigger the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to register systems with Katello.
- No special user privileges within Katello, other than the capacity to register a system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Hutar of Red Hat.
- It affects versions of Katello shipped with Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.4
- Red Hat has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact and planned for a future update to address this.
