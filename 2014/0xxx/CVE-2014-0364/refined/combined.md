How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Original Release Date: 2014-04-29 | Last Revised: 2014-04-29

---

### Overview

Ignite Realtime's Smack XMPP API ServerTrustManger trusts unauthorized SSL certificates ([CWE-358](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/358.html)) and IQ requests do not verify the from attribute allowing anyone to spoof IQ responses. ([CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html))

### Description

| **CWE-358:** **Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard** **- CVE-2014-0363**  The implementation of ServerTrustManger in Smack API version 3.4.1, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly verify the basicConstraints and nameConstraints of a certificate within a certificate chain.**CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity - CVE-2014-0364**The implementation of ParseRoster in Smack API version 3.4.1, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly verify the from attribute for roster queries.The CVSS score below is for CVE-2014-0363. |
| --- |

### Impact

# RHSA-2015:1176 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that the JClouds scriptbuilder Statements class writes a temporary file to a predictable location. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive data, denial of service, or other attacks. (CVE-2014-4651)

It was found that SSLSocket in Smack did not perform hostname verification. An attacker could redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control. (CVE-2014-5075)

It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1093276#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-01 06:53:10 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2014-0364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0364) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2014-0364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0364) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0364> Assigned: 20131205 Reference: <http://community.igniterealtime.org/blogs/ignite/2014/04/17/asmack-400-rc1-has-been-released> Reference: CERT-VN:VU#489228 Reference: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/489228>  The ParseRoster component in the Ignite Realtime Smack XMPP API before 4.0.0-rc1 does not verify the from attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza, which allows remote attackers to spoof IQ responses via a crafted attribute.  It is not clear whether this flaw affects the version of smack in Fedora. Both of these look to be needed to complete the fix:  <http://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/SMACK-533> <http://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/SMACK-538>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1093276#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-01 06:54:59 UTC  ```  Created smack tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1093277](show_bug.cgi?id=1093277 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0364 smack: IQ response spoofing [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1093276#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-30 20:52:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.2  Via RHSA-2014:0819 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0819.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1093276#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-30 20:52:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss BRMS 6.0.2  Via RHSA-2014:0818 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0818.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1093276#c6)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-11 10:57:36 UTC  ``` smack-4.0.6-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We are happy to announce the release of (a)Smack 4.0.0-rc1. This is the first aSmack release that is in sync with Smack’s codebase and therefore marks an important milestone for Smack on Android. It is also the first non-snapshot release that is going to be available on the Maven Central Repositories (SMACK-265).

Smack 4.0.0-rc1 includes some major changes and important improvements including security related fixes. While this is marked as release candidate, users are encouraged to update because **some important security bugs have been fixed**. Please consult the [“Smack 4.0 Readme and Upgrade Guide”](https://community.igniterealtime.org/docs/DOC-2703) for further information regarding the changes between Smack 3.4 and 4.0.

Previous Smack versions suffered from a missing “Basic Constraints” check in ServerTrustManager (SMACK-410): this allowed anyone with a valid CA-signed certificate for any domain to generate a certificate for any other domain that would be accepted by Smack’s ServerTrustManager. Moxie Marlinspike found the same error in IE back in 2002 and wrote a detailed summary about it: <http://www.thoughtcrime.org/ie-ssl-chain.txt>

We would like to thank Ryan Sleevi of the Google Chrome Security Team for reporting the issue to us.

The fix for Smack was simply removing ServerTrustManager and the related code altogether. ConnectionConfiguration now only has a setting for a custom SSLContext. We shifted the responsibility for TLS certificate validation out of the library to the user, where it belongs. A fixed version of ServerTrustManager may return as an optional module in a future Smack release. Contributions are, as always, welcome.

A second important security vulnerability often found in XMPP implementations was made public by Thijs Alkemad aka xnyhps early this year. Affected implementations did not properly verify the ‘from’ attribute of IQ responses and were therefore vulnerable to spoofed IQ packets. You can read more about it here: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alkemade-xmpp-iq-validation-00>

Thijs also reported Smack as vulnerable in SMACK-533 and SMACK-538. Thanks to Lars Noschinski, patches were quickly provided and Smack is now immune.

(a)Smack 4.0.0-rc1 is considered mature. It is marked as release candidate because we have only a small number of people who are testing the current (a)Smack development snapshot. We ask everyone using Smack in some sort of staging, development or non-critical production environment to try 4.0.0-rc1 and report any problems or feedback to the community forums.

Thanks to everyone working on Smack 4.0:

Besides the mentioned security issues, Smack 4.0 contains also many new improvments and other bugfixes. An overview of all resolved issues in Smack 4.0.0-rc1 can be found in JIRA

I have posted a thread about updating Spark to this Smack version and testing it with the nightly builds as soon as possible <http://community.igniterealtime.org/message/238318#238318> It is our main client software here after all
