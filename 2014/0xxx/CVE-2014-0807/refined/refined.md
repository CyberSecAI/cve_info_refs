Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when handling user data related to delivery addresses in EC-CUBE. Specifically, the application fails to verify if a user is authorized to modify or delete specific delivery addresses associated with their account. This is due to the absence of a check on `other_deliv_id`  before processing requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of authorization checks before processing delivery address modification requests.  The system does not properly verify if the `other_deliv_id` being manipulated belongs to the currently logged-in user.
*   **Information Alteration:** This lack of authorization allows any user to potentially modify or delete another user's delivery address information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could alter the delivery information associated with other users' accounts. This could lead to the misdirection of orders, potential financial loss, or inconvenience for the affected users.
*   **Data Deletion:** Attackers could delete delivery addresses, potentially disrupting the user's ability to complete orders.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack**: The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the application, which can be initiated over the internet.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate parameters related to delivery addresses (`other_deliv_id`) in HTTP requests to target specific users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the shopping site:** The attacker needs to be able to access the online store's web interface.
*   **User Account (potentially):** While the provided information doesn't explicitly state that the attacker needs to be logged in, the code patch implies that some form of authentication is required as there's a check for login status before the vulnerable code.
*   **Knowledge of Parameter Names**: The attacker needs to be aware of the parameters used to handle delivery information (e.g., `other_deliv_id`).

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Code:** The vulnerability is located in the `LC_Page_Shopping_Deliv.php` file in the `action` and `mobileProcess` methods.
*   **Patch Details:** The patch involves adding a `doCheck` function to verify that the `other_deliv_id` belongs to the currently logged-in user before any changes are made.
*   **Version Specific Fixes:** The patch requires changes in different lines for different versions of the software as noted in the vendor advisory.

**CVSS V2:**

*   **Access Vector:** Network (AV:N)
*   **Access Complexity:** Low (AC:L)
*   **Authentication:** None (Au:N)
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** None (C:N)
*   **Integrity Impact:** Partial (I:P)
*   **Availability Impact:** None (A:N)

This translates to a CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (Medium severity).
