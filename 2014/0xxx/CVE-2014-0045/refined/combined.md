Package        : mumble
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0044 CVE-2014-0045
Debian Bug     : 737739

Several issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP
client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:

CVE-2014-0044

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an
    out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could
    exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a
    mumble client by causing the application to crash.

CVE-2014-0445

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A
    malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client
    crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute
    arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.

Mumble Security Advisory 2014-002
ID: Mumble-SA-2014-002
Date: February 2014
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-0045
Product: Mumble
Mumble Website: http://mumble.info
Permalink: http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-002.txt
Last Updated: 05-02-2014
1. Vulnerability
A malformed Opus voice packet sent to a Mumble client
could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. This causes
a client crash (Denial of Service) and can potentially
be used to execute arbitrary code, though this is
unconfirmed.
This issue can be triggered remotely by an entity
participating in a Mumble voice chat.
2. Affected versions and configurations
Mumble 1.2.4 in its default configuration is vulnerable.
This is the only stable release that is vulnerable.
Pre-release snapshots released prior to 1.2.4 (these
are named 1.2.3--g) that include Opus
support are potentially vulnerable.
Pre-release snapshots released after 1.2.4 (these are
named 1.2.4--g) are vulnerable.
Some distributions (such as Debian and Ubuntu) ship a
pre-release snapshot in their stable distributions.
This snapshot is version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5, and it is
also vulnerable.
3. Mitigation
A Mumble client built without Opus support is not
vulnerable to this issue.
Opus is enabled in the default build configuration for
Mumble, but can be disabled by passing CONFIG+=no-opus
to the qmake program when building the Mumble client.
(Note that Mumble might still enable Opus support if
an installed version of Opus is found via pkg-config.
To avoid this, you will need to pass
CONFIG+="bundled-opus no-opus" to qmake to also disable
the pkg-config querying.)
Version 1.2.3 and prior of Mumble's server component
('Murmur' or 'mumble-server') does not allow the
transmission of Opus packets, and as such a vulnerable
client connected to a stock Murmur server that runs
version 1.2.3 or prior should not be affected by this
issue.
Note however that since Mumble is a centralized VoIP
system, a modified server could potentially also
trigger malformed Opus packets to be sent to clients
of its choosing, thus triggering this issue.
4. Details
Mumble failed to properly check the return value of
a call to the opus\_decode\_float() function in
Mumble's AudioOutputSpeech::needSamples() method.
When opus\_decode\_float() encounters an error, it
returns a negative integer signalling the error
condition it met.
Instead of catching these errors, Mumble would
assign the negative values to a variable denoting
the amount of decoded samples (decodedSamples)
by the call to the opus\_decode\_float() function
and continue its processing.
Later on in the AudioOutputSpeech::needSamples()
method, the decodedSamples variable is converted
to a pair of unsigned integers: inlen and outlen.
The inlen variable's value becomes close to UINT\_MAX,
since the error codes returned by opus\_decode\_float()
are small negative integers. The outlen variable's
value is bounded by a sample rate calculation, which
causes the value to be somewhere around
UINT\_MAX / 48000, depending on the Opus error code
and the current sample rate being used by the Mumble
client.
Following this, these two unsigned integers are then
used as buffer lengths in calls to
speex\_resampler\_process\_float() and in a memory-copying
"for"-loop at the top of the
AudioOutputSpeech::needSamples() method.
The inadvertently large buffer lengths cause the two
cases above to perform reads and writes outside the
bounds of their heap-allocated buffers.
5. Credits
This issue was discovered by the Mumble team after a
reproducible crash that happened when transmitting
audio was reported by Wesley Wolfe on January 25, 2014.
6. Fix
A fix for this issue has been released in Mumble 1.2.5.
A fix is also available in the master branch of Mumble's
Git repository.
A patch which can be applied to previous vulnerable
versions can be found in-line below.
(Note: this patch does not apply to Debian and Ubuntu's
1.2.3-349-g315b5f5 version due to whitespace changes
of the code above the inserted "if"-statement in the
first hunk of the patch. It is, however, trivially
applied or fixed by hand.)

Mumble Security Advisory 2014-004
ID: Mumble-SA-2014-004
Date: February 2014
CVE Reference: Not assigned
Product: MumbleKit, Mumble for iOS
Mumble Website: http://mumble.info
Permalink: http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-004.txt
Last Updated: 05-02-2014
1. Vulnerability
A malformed Opus voice packet sent to a MumbleKit
client (such as Mumble for iOS) could trigger a
heap-based buffer overflow. This causes a client
crash (Denial of Service) and can potentially
be used to execute arbitrary code, though this is
unconfirmed.
This issue can be triggered remotely by an entity
participating in a Mumble voice chat.
2. Affected versions and configurations
All versions of MumbleKit with Opus support are
affected unless they include the fix for this
issue, which is available in the MumbleKit Git
repository as commit
fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d.
Mumble for iOS version 1.1 through 1.2.2 are
vulnerable, as they use vulnerable versions
of MumbleKit.
3. Mitigation
No known mitigation strategy for this issue exists.
Version 1.2.3 and prior of Mumble's server component
('Murmur' or 'mumble-server') does not allow the
transmission of Opus packets, and as such a vulnerable
client connected to a stock Murmur server that runs
version 1.2.3 or prior should not be affected by this
issue.
Note however that since Mumble is a centralized VoIP
system, a modified server could potentially also
trigger malformed Opus packets to be sent to clients
of its choosing, thus triggering this issue.
4. Details
Mumble failed to properly check the return value of
a call to the opus\_decode\_float() function in
Mumble's MKAudioOutputSpeech#needSamples: method.
When opus\_decode\_float() encounters an error, it
returns a negative integer signalling the error
condition it met.
Instead of catching these errors, Mumble would
assign the negative values to a variable denoting
the amount of decoded samples (decodedSamples)
by the call to the opus\_decode\_float() function
and continue its processing.

method, the decodedSamples variable is converted
to a pair of unsigned integers: inlen and outlen.

bounds of their heap-allocated buffers.
5. Credits
This issue was discovered by the Mumble team after a
reproducible crash that happened when transmitting
audio was reported by Wesley Wolfe on January 25, 2014.
6. Fix
A fix for this issue has been released in Mumble for iOS 1.2.3.
Other users of MumbleKit should make sure they are using a
version of MumbleKit that includes the fixed commit, which is
fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d.
