Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `rubygem-rbovirt` gem was using the `rest-client` gem with SSL verification disabled by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Disabled SSL Verification:** By disabling SSL verification, the `rbovirt` gem was not validating the authenticity of the server's SSL/TLS certificate during HTTPS requests. This made the application susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker could intercept the communication between a client using the vulnerable `rbovirt` gem and the server.
*   **Data Compromise:** The attacker could potentially eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted, modify the data in transit, or inject malicious content into the communication stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker needs to be positioned within the network path of the communication between the vulnerable client and server.
*   **MITM:** The attacker would intercept the client's request and pose as the legitimate server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable client and server.
*   **MITM Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, such as by using a rogue access point or by compromising network infrastructure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Michael Samuel of Amcom.
*   The issue was fixed in `rbovirt` gem version 0.0.24.
*   Red Hat acknowledged the issue and released updates to address it.
*   The fix involves enabling SSL certificate verification in the rest-client.
