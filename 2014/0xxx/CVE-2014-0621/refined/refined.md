{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Technicolor TC7200 router does not properly validate requests, allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist in the router's web interface.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform actions on the router without the user's consent. This includes:\n  - Factory reset\n  - Disabling advanced options\n  - Removing IP filters\n  - Removing firewall settings",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft malicious web pages or links that, when visited by an authenticated user, trigger requests to the router's web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website or link while they are logged into the router's web interface."
