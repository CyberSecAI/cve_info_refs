# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 10.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 10.0 |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Affected Products  * In March, 2013, Linksys was divested from Cisco and is now part of Belkin. For questions regarding all Linksys products, please contact the Belkin Incident Response Team at security@belkin.com.   Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router running firmware version 2.0.3.2 and prior   + Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router hardware version 1.0 and 1.1 running firmware version 1.1.13 and prior   + Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router hardware version 2.0 running firmware version 2.0.2.1 and prior   + Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point running firmware version 2.0.6.1 and priorProducts Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * A vulnerability in the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point, Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router, and the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain *root*-level access to an affected device. This vulnerability can be triggered from the LAN interfaces of the Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router and the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router from the wireless LAN (WLAN) and the LAN interfaces of the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point.       This vulnerability is due to an undocumented test interface in the TCP service listening on port 32764 of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the affected device from the LAN-side interface and issuing arbitrary commands in the underlying operating system. An exploit could allow the attacker to access user credentials for the administrator account of the device, and read the device configuration. The exploit can also allow the attacker to issue arbitrary commands on the device with escalated privileges.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCum37566](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum37566) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point; Cisco bug IDs [CSCum43693](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43693) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCum43700](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43700) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for the WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router; and Cisco bug ID [CSCum43685](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43685) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router.

**I WILL NOT MANUALLY UPDATE THIS REPOSITORY ANYMORE**

If you want to add a router in the list, please make a pull-request, also remember to **USE THE POC** and paste the result in your pull-request.
Telnet clients and other solutions may not be relevant (some false negative / positive reported).

Some random code/data about the backdoor I found in my Linksys WAG200G (TCP/32764).

The backdoor may be present in other hardware, I'll update this readme accordingly. :)

Possible fix :

* if it's listening on the internet: add a firewall rule in the web UI ([@domainzero](https://twitter.com/domainzero/status/419146140999626752))
* it also seems to work on the LAN side. ([issue 35](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/35#issuecomment-31592308))
* but apparently, not for every body ([issue 57](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/57)) so use the PoC again after adding the rule to make sure the firewall does its job.
* install an open source firmware (for example OpenWRT or Tomato) this is NOT magical, OpenWAG200 is vuln: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openwag200/files/OpenWAG200/1.4/>
* kill the backdoor after each reboot ([issue 61](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/61) & [TCP-32764-First-Aid](https://github.com/lahdekorpi/TCP-32764-First-Aid/))
* use this alternative firmware: [amod](http://alfie.altervista.org/amod/) (thank you [pidocchio](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/13#issuecomment-32546542) and [nremond](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/13#issuecomment-34008200))
* redirect the port traffic in your router firewall to a local unused IP and done ([@osisecurite])

Probable source of the backdoor:

* SerComm <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6998258> (nice finding :) )
* Confirmed by a header ([socket\_header.h](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/blob/master/socket_header.h)) in cisco gpl sources (thank you Andreas Fett!)

Backdoor **LISTENING ON THE INTERNET** confirmed in :

* Linksys WAG120N ([@p\_w999](https://twitter.com/p_w999/status/419444989051940864))
* Netgear DG834B V5.01.14 ([@domainzero](https://twitter.com/domainzero/status/419133964528263169))

* Netgear WPNT834 ([issue 79](https://github.com/elvanderb/TCP-32764/issues/79))

Some clarifications:
I didn't want to waste my time in writing a full report, it's a very simple backdoor that really doesn't deserve more than some crappy slides. Moreover, my English is quite bad.

I had a lot of fun in writing / drawing the slides, all the necessary information is in them. If people don't understand them or find them "too full of meme" then - well - it's too bad for them. :)
