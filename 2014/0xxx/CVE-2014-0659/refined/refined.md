Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0659:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an undocumented test interface present in the TCP service listening on port 32764 of affected Cisco devices. This interface should not have been accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undocumented Test Interface:** The primary weakness is the existence of this hidden interface that was unintentionally left active in the production firmware.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The test interface does not require any authentication, allowing anyone who can access port 32764 to interact with it.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The interface allows attackers to send arbitrary commands, which are then executed by the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root-Level Access:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can gain root-level access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can access user credentials, specifically for the administrator account.
*   **Configuration Disclosure:** The device's configuration can be read by the attacker.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device with escalated (root) privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The combination of these impacts allows for complete compromise of the affected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack can be carried out from the LAN interface of the Cisco WRVS4400N and RVS4000 routers. The Cisco WAP4410N is vulnerable via both the LAN and WLAN interfaces.
*   **Port 32764:** The vulnerability is exploited by connecting to TCP port 32764 on the vulnerable device and sending commands via this interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device's LAN or WLAN interface, depending on the device type.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** No user credentials or prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Interface:** The attacker must know about the undocumented test interface and the commands it accepts. This information has become public with the vulnerability disclosure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific models of Cisco Small Business devices, namely the WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point, WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router, and the RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router.
*   Public exploit code is available, which increases the likelihood of exploitation in the wild.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Eloi Vanderbeken on their GitHub page.
*   Cisco has released firmware updates to address this vulnerability.
