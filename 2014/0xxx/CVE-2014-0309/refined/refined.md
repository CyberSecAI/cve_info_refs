        "source": "docs.microsoft.com_8d8c513b_20250125_033927.html",
        "root_cause": "Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",
        "weaknesses": "Memory corruption vulnerability",
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This could lead to the attacker gaining the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative privileges. Attackers could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content/ads containing malicious code.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage, often done through a link in an email or instant message or by getting them to open a malicious attachment."
