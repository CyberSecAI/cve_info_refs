{
  "CVE-2014-0373": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way SNMP implementation in the Serviceability component in OpenJDK raised SnmpStatusException exception. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of SnmpStatusException within the Serviceability component of OpenJDK.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient exception handling in SNMP implementation",
      "Potential for bypassing Java sandbox restrictions"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions by exploiting this vulnerability, which could lead to unauthorized access or actions.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an untrusted Java application or applet.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker would need to execute an untrusted Java application or applet.",
        "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is related to how OpenJDK's SNMP implementation handles specific exceptions, potentially allowing attackers to break out of Java sandbox environments. Multiple affected products include various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Java, and OpenJDK distributions."
