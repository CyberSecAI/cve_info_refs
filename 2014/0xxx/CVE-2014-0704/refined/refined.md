Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-0704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the IGMP processing subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC). It stems from improper validation of a specific field in certain IGMP message types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The IGMP subsystem may perform a memory over-read when processing certain IGMP messages. Subsequent processing of the extraneous data may trigger an error.
- The vulnerability exists in the improper handling of IGMP version 3 messages by the WLC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by injecting a malicious IGMP version 3 message.
- This leads to a critical error causing a reload of the WLC, resulting in a temporary disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted IGMP version 3 message onto the network.
- The affected WLC must receive and process this malicious message for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the network where the vulnerable Cisco WLC is operating.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to craft and send a specific type of malicious IGMPv3 message.
- The IGMPv3 snooping feature needs to be enabled on the WLC. This is disabled by default.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCuh33240.
- The CVSS base score is 10.0, and the temporal score is 8.7 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C).
- This vulnerability affects Cisco WLC versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4. The recommended fix is to migrate to version 7.0.250.0 or 7.4.121.0 or higher (depending on the controller type and ability to upgrade).
