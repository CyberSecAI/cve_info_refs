{
  "CVE-2014-0244": {
    "description": "Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in the nmbd Netbios name service daemon. A malformed packet can cause the nmbd server to enter an infinite loop, preventing it to process later requests to the Netbios name service.",
    "root_cause": "The `sys_recvfile()` function in nmbd doesn't properly handle non-blocking sockets, which can lead to an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of non-blocking sockets",
      "Lack of proper error handling in `sys_recvfrom()` function.",
       "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted packet, causing the nmbd daemon to enter an infinite loop and consume excessive CPU resources, preventing it from processing subsequent requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed packet to the nmbd service"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system."
