# [R2] SecurityCenter 5.8.0 Fixes Multiple Third-Party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (Apache Xalan and Serializer) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled libraries to address the potential impact of these issues in SecurityCenter. SecurityCenter 5.8.0 updates both Apache Xalan and Serializer to version 2.7.2 to address the identified vulnerabilities. A separate stand-alone patch (SecurityCenter Patch 201811.1) has also been released to address these issues for customers running SecurityCenter 5.7.1 and earlier.

Note: The CVSSv2 score used in this advisory reflects CVE-2014-0107, as it is considered the highest risk.

### Solution

Tenable has released SecurityCenter 5.8.0 and SecurityCenter Patch 201811.1 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/securitycenter-3d-tool-and-xtool).

Note: If you are running SecurityCenter version 5.5.0 or later, you can upgrade directly to version 5.8.0. If you are running a version earlier than 5.5.0, upgrade to version 5.5.0 before upgrading to version 5.8.0.

Note: If you are running SecurityCenter version 5.7.1 or earlier, you can apply the stand-alone patch without upgrading to SecurityCenter 5.8.0. Instructions to apply the stand-alone patch can be obtained from the SecurityCenter 201811.1 Release Notes page (https://docs.tenable.com/releasenotes/securitycenter/securitycenter\_20181113.htm).

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*

*For more details on submitting vulnerability information, please see our [Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines](/security/report) page.*

# RHSA-2014:0348 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: xalan-j2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0348)

## Topic

Updated xalan-j2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Xalan-Java is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML,
text, or other XML document types.

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

All xalan-j2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

#### Description

The TransformerFactory in Apache Xalan-Java before 2.7.2 does not properly restrict access to certain properties when FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING is enabled, which allows remote attackers to bypass expected restrictions and load arbitrary classes or access external resources via a crafted (1) xalan:content-header, (2) xalan:entities, (3) xslt:content-header, or (4) xslt:entities property, or a Java property that is bound to the XSLT 1.0 system-property function.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c0)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:12:16 UTC  ``` It was found that the Xalan-Java secure processing feature imposes insufficient constraints:  * Java properties, bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property(), are accessible.  * Output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources are allowed.  * Arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is in the classpath, as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure processing disabled, effectively bypassing the intended protection.  A remote attacker who is able to provide XSL that will be processed by Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the constraints of the secure processing feature. Depending on the components available on the classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the application server running the application that uses Xalan-Java.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c1)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:37:34 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2435>  Upstream patch commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1581058>  External References:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-002.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-01 17:51:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0348 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0348.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c6)  Fedora Update System    2014-04-05 04:53:34 UTC  ``` xalan-j2-2.7.1-22.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

#### Description

Heap-based buffer overflow in the XML Signature Reference functionality in Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ (aka xml-security-c) before 1.7.2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed XPointer expressions. NOTE: this is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2154.

# RHSA-2015:1888 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 which fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
execution speed and quality.

It was found that the code which checked that the server hostname matches
the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates
was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an
SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153,
CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class
implementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could
send specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which
could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running that application. (CVE-2014-0248)

It was found that the implementation of the
org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)

It was discovered that the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL
project to check that the server host name matches the domain name in the
subject's CN field was flawed. This could be exploited by a
man-in-the-middle attacker by spoofing a valid certificate using a
specially crafted subject. (CVE-2014-3604)

Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting
CVE-2014-3530. The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of
Red Hat Product Security, the CVE-2014-3604 issue was discovered by Arun
Babu Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security, and the CVE-2014-0248 issue
was discovered by Marek Schmidt of Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform installation (including its databases,
applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform server
by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this
update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat JBoss SOA
Platform server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

# Xalan-Java: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201604-02**

Insufficient constraints in Apache's Xalan-Java might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code and load arbitrary classes.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/xalan** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2** |

### Background

Xalan-Java is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into
HTML, text, or other XML document types.

### Description

The TransformerFactory in Apache Xalan-Java does not properly restrict
access to certain properties when FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING is enabled.
This can also be exploited via a Java property that is bound to the XSLT
1.0 system-property function.

### Impact

A remote attacker could inject specially crafted XSLT properties
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

All Xalan-Java users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/xalan-2.7.2"

```

# RHSA-2014:1351 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.1.0 Rollup Patch 1, which addresses several
security issues, multiple bug fixes, and adds various enhancements, is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
6.1.0. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the
readme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security
issues are addressed in this release:

It was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying
a user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end
that allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of
Apache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as
valid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain
access to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.
(CVE-2014-0034)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error
messages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted request which, when processed by an application using
Apache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,
possibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)

It was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache
CXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed
by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk
space, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)

It was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web
page that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.
(CVE-2014-0168)

It was found that the Spring Framework did not, by default, disable the
resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration when processing
user-provided XML documents. By observing differences in response times, an
attacker could identify valid IP addresses on the internal network with
functioning web servers. (CVE-2014-0225)

It was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache
CXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name
and password used by the client application using Apache CXF.
(CVE-2014-0035)

A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-0193)

Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
installation instructions.

Red Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the
CVE-2014-0193 issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
security update.

**oCERT-2014-002 Xalan-Java insufficient secure processing**

**Description**:

The [Xalan-Java](http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j) library is a
popular XSLT processor from the Apache Software Foundation.

The library implements the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) which
supports a secure processing feature for interpretive and XSLCT processors. The
intent of this feature is to limit XSLT/XML processing behaviours to "make the
XSLT processor behave in a secure fashion".

It has been discovered that the secure processing features suffers from
several limitations that undermine its purpose. The enabling of the secure
processing feature in fact still allows the following processing to take place:

* Java properties, bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property(), are accessible.
* output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources are allowed (XALANJ-2435).
* arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)
  is in the classpath, as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure processing
  disabled, effectively bypassing the intended protection.

**Affected version**:

[Xalan-Java](http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j) >= 2.7.0

**Fixed version**:

[Xalan-Java](http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j) >= r1581058 (see references)

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Nicolas Gregoire <nicolas.gregoire AT agarri.fr>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c0)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:12:16 UTC  ``` It was found that the Xalan-Java secure processing feature imposes insufficient constraints:  * Java properties, bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property(), are accessible.  * Output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources are allowed.  * Arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is in the classpath, as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure processing disabled, effectively bypassing the intended protection.  A remote attacker who is able to provide XSL that will be processed by Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the constraints of the secure processing feature. Depending on the components available on the classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the application server running the application that uses Xalan-Java.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c1)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:37:34 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2435>  Upstream patch commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1581058>  External References:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-002.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-01 17:51:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0348 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0348.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c6)  Fedora Update System    2014-04-05 04:53:34 UTC  ``` xalan-j2-2.7.1-22.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

#### Description

When using the FEATURE\_SECURE\_PROCESSING ("http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing") on a TransformerFactory it seems appropriate that the output properties:

{http://xml.apache.org/xalan}

content-handler

{http://xml.apache.org/xalan}

entities

{http://xml.apache.org/xslt}

content-handler

{http://xml.apache.org/xslt}

entities

should be ignored (see <http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/usagepatterns.html#outputprops>)

These properties can be used to load an arbitrary class or access an arbitrary URL/resource so are problematic when secure processing is desired.

<xsl:output xalan:content-handler="org.example.BadClass" ...

<xsl:output xalan:entities="http://example.org/reallyLargeFile.bin" ...

These features could be used to load a class that had undesirable side-effects or to load a large file and exhaust memory, etc.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libxalan2-java
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0107
Debian Bug     : 742577

Nicolas Gregoire discovered several vulnerabilities in libxalan2-java,
a Java library for XSLT processing.  Crafted XSLT programs could
access system properties or load arbitrary classes, resulting in
information disclosure and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-5+deb6u1.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-7+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxalan2-java packages.
