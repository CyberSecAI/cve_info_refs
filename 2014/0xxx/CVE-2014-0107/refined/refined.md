{
  "CVE-2014-0107": {
    "Description": "The TransformerFactory in Apache Xalan-Java before 2.7.2 does not properly restrict access to certain properties when FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING is enabled, which allows remote attackers to bypass expected restrictions and load arbitrary classes or access external resources via a crafted (1) xalan:content-header, (2) xalan:entities, (3) xslt:content-header, or (4) xslt:entities property, or a Java property that is bound to the XSLT 1.0 system-property function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient restrictions on access to properties when FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING is enabled in Apache Xalan-Java's TransformerFactory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Ability to load arbitrary classes and access external resources."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can bypass security restrictions leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, and potentially full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via crafted XSLT content containing malicious properties or exploiting Java system property bindings.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to supply crafted XSLT content to an application that uses a vulnerable version of Xalan-Java."
  }
