Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `awesome_spawn` library constructs command lines from user-provided parameters. It fails to properly sanitize these parameters before passing them to the shell, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the library does not properly sanitize parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands into the command line. Specifically, the `build_command_line` function in `awesome_spawn.rb` and the `build` method in `command_line_builder.rb` construct the command line by concatenating user-supplied parameters. While shell escaping is applied to individual parameter values, the construction logic allows injection of shell metacharacters via parameter keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the process running the `awesome_spawn` library. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, data theft, denial of service, and more.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Parameters:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious input for the `params` argument of the `AwesomeSpawn.run` method. For example, a malicious parameter like `{'a' => '; touch /tmp/pwned'}` would result in the execution of the `touch` command.
- **Untrusted Input:** If the command or its arguments include any user-supplied data that's not carefully sanitized, it could lead to arbitrary command execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to influence input:** An attacker needs to be able to control at least a part of the `command` or `params` arguments passed to `AwesomeSpawn.run` or `AwesomeSpawn.build_command_line`. This could occur when the application uses user-provided input for command construction or uses external configuration files which can be modified by the attacker.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided github commit `e524f85` shows the refactoring of command line building logic into a separate class,  `CommandLineBuilder`, but this commit does not address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper sanitization of keys.
- The `rubysec.com` content confirms the command injection vulnerability and provides a simple example demonstrating the flaw: `AwesomeSpawn.run('ls',:params => {'-l' => ";touch haxored"})`.
-  The github advisory database entry provides a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 (Critical) and highlights that the vulnerability was introduced in versions prior to 1.2.0 and that version 1.2.0 addresses the issue. It also indicates that the attack vector is via the network and that no privileges or user interaction is required to exploit it.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization, specifically in the handling of parameter keys when building the command line which makes arbitrary command injection possible.
