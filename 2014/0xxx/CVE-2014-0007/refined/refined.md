{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A shell command injection flaw existed in foreman-proxy's TFTP module when verifying URLs. The `tftp/fetch_boot_file` API did not properly sanitize user-supplied input leading to command execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Shell command injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the foreman-proxy TFTP module.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the system with the privileges of the user running foreman-proxy.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit the `tftp/fetch_boot_file` API by injecting shell commands into the `path` parameter of the request. For example, using a crafted URL such as `http://localhost/test;touch /tmp/busted`, leading to command execution on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `tftp/fetch_boot_file` API endpoint of the foreman-proxy service."
