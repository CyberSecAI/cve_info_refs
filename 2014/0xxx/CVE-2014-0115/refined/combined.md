#### Description

Note: This is actually version 0.9.0.1 but I couldn't choose that in the dropdown. I suspect that the problem still exists.

I found that it's possible to access any readable file on the system via the UI worker log viewer. To reproduce, navigate to:

http://<host:port>/log?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
