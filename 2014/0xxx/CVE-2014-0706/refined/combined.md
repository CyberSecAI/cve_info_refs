| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

Details  * The Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functionality, including security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility. These devices communicate with controller-based access points over any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.      The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by the following vulnerabilities:   **Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the WebAuth feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload.      The vulnerability is due to a failure to deallocate memory used during the processing of a WebAuth login. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of WebAuth requests at a high rate and leave them in an uncompleted state. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume all available memory on the device. This causes a watchdog process to restart the WLC, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) while the device reboots.      The WebAuth feature must be enabled and configured for a device to be affected by this vulnerability. This feature is disabled by default.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCuf52361](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf52361) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0701.Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Unauthorized Access to Associated Access Points VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the Cisco IOS code that is pushed to Cisco Aironet 1260, 2600, 3500, and 3600 Series access points (AP) by a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized, privileged access to the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to a race condition that could result in the administrative HTTP server of an affected access point being enabled even though it is explicitly disabled by an administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device using locally-stored credentials of the AP. A successful attack could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected AP and make arbitrary changes to the configuration.      In many deployment scenarios, the locally-stored default AP username and password has not been changed from the factory default. In these zero-touch scenarios, the devices are designed to connect automatically to a WLC and download firmware and configurations.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf66202](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf66202) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0703.Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the IGMP processing subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a specific field in certain IGMP message types. When messages are processed, the IGMP subsystem may perform a memory over-read. When subsequent processing is performed on the extraneous data an error may occur that results in a reload of the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious IGMP version 3 message onto the network that will be received and processed by an affected WLC. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a critical error on the WLC, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.      The IGMPv3 Snooping feature is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator for a device to be vulnerable.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh33240](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh33240) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0704.   Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the multicast listener discovery (MLD) service of a Cisco WLC configured for IPv6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly parse malformed MLD version 2 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malformed MLDv2 packet to a multicast-enabled network that the Cisco WLC is listening for. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a critical error on the WLC, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.      The MLDv2 Snooping feature is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator for a device to be vulnerable.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh74233](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh74233) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0705.   Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Crafted Frame Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the Cisco WLC could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a critical error, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.      This vulnerability is due to a failure to correctly process an Ethernet 802.11 frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Ethernet 802.11 frame. Repeated exploitation may result in a sustained DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue87929](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue87929) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0706.Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Crafted Frame Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the Cisco WLC could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a critical error, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.      This vulnerability is due to a failure to correctly process an Ethernet 802.11 frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Ethernet 802.11 frame. Repeated exploitation may result in a sustained DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf80681](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf80681) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0707  Workarounds  * Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Unauthorized Access to Associated Access Points Vulnerability Administrators may mitigate this issue by configuring Global AP Management Credentials on the affected device. This will disable the defaults and help ensure that unauthorized parties are unable to access the AP via the HTTP interface.      There are no on-device workarounds that mitigate the other vulnerabilities detailed in this document  Mitigation information for the vulnerability described in this advisory is available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location: [Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=30830)  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 7.0 | 7.0.250.0 | 7.0.250.0 or 7.4.121.0\* |   | 7.2 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.3 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.4 | 7.4.110.0 | 7.4.121.0 |      **\* 4400/WiSM1/3750/2000 controllers can not upgrade beyond 7.0 code**      | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Unauthorized Access to Associated Access Points Vulnerability | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 7.4 | 7.4.110.0 | 7.4.121.0 |      | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service Vulnerability | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 4.x | N/A | Migrate to 7.0.250.0 |   | 5.x | N/A | Migrate to 7.0.250.0 |   | 6.x | N/A | Migrate to 7.0.250.0 |   | 7.0 | 7.0.250.0 | Migrate to 7.0.250.0 or 7.4.121.0\* |   | 7.1 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.2 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.3 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |      **\* 4400/WiSM1/3750/2000 controllers can not upgrade beyond 7.0 code**      | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 7.2 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.3 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.4 | 7.4.121.0 | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 |   | 7.5 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |      | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Crafted Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability CVE-2014-0706 | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 7.2 | 7.2.115.2 | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.3 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.4 | 7.4.110.0 | 7.4.121.0 |      | Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Crafted Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability CVE-2014-0707 | | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed** | **Recommended** |   | 7.2 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.3 | N/A | Migrate to 7.4.121.0 or 7.6.100.0 |   | 7.4 | 7.4.110.0 | 7.4.121.0 |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
