- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of page content by SharePoint Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote code execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the W3WP service account on the target SharePoint site.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker sends specially crafted page content to a target SharePoint server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the target SharePoint site. Anonymous access to the site would remove the need for authentication.
