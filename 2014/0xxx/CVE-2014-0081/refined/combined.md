How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: XSS Vulnerability in number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and
 number_to_human (CVE-2014-0081)

XSS Vulnerability in number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and number_to_human

There is an XSS vulnerability in the number_to_currency, number_to_percentage
and number_to_human helpers in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0081.

Versions Affected:  All.
Fixed Versions:     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.

Impact
------
These helpers allows users to nicely format a numeric value. Some of the parameters
to the helper (format, negative_format and units) are not escaped correctly.
Application which pass user controlled data as one of these parameters are
vulnerable to an XSS attack.

All users passing user controlled data to these parameters of the number helpers
should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

--------
The 4.1.0.rc1, 4.0.3 and 3.2.17 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------

The workaround for this issue is to escape the value passed to the parameter.
For example, replace code like this:

```
<%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: params[:format]) %>
```

With code like this

```
<%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: h(params[:format])) %>
```

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.1-beta series
* 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.0 series
* 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present. Users
of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
releases.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 20:41:07 UTC  ``` Aaron Patterson of the Ruby on Rails project reports:  There is an XSS vulnerability in the number_to_currency, number_to_percentage and number_to_human helpers in Ruby on Rails.   Versions Affected:  All. Fixed Versions:     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.  Impact ------ These helpers allows users to nicely format a numeric value. Some of the parameters to the helper (format, negative_format and units) are not escaped correctly. Application which pass user controlled data as one of these parameters are vulnerable to an XSS attack.  All users passing user controlled data to these parameters of the number helpers should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863436](attachment.cgi?id=863436&action=diff "3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863436&action=edit "3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch") 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863437](attachment.cgi?id=863437&action=diff "4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863437&action=edit "4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch") 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:41:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863438](attachment.cgi?id=863438&action=diff "4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863438&action=edit "4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch") 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1065520#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-15 04:41:28 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065538#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:36:24 UTC  ``` Aaron Patterson of the Ruby on Rails project reports:  There is a denial of service vulnerability in the text rendering component of Action View.  Versions Affected: 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x Not affected: 4.0.x Fixed Versions: 3.2.17  Impact ------  Strings sent in specially crafted headers will be converted to symbols. This can cause a denial of service since symbols are not removed by the garbage collector. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1065538#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:42:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863439](attachment.cgi?id=863439&action=diff "3-0-render_text_dos.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863439&action=edit "3-0-render_text_dos.patch") 3-0-render_text_dos.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1065538#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:42:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863440](attachment.cgi?id=863440&action=diff "3-1-render_text_dos.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863440&action=edit "3-1-render_text_dos.patch") 3-1-render_text_dos.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1065538#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-14 21:43:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 863441](attachment.cgi?id=863441&action=diff "3-2-render_text_dos.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=863441&action=edit "3-2-render_text_dos.patch") 3-2-render_text_dos.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1065538#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-15 04:41:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting this issue.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0306)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix two security issues
are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
view components.

It was found that several number conversion helpers in Action View did not
properly escape all their parameters. An attacker could use these flaws to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user as parameters to the affected helpers.
(CVE-2014-0081)

A memory consumption issue was discovered in the text rendering component
of Action View. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
of service attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in
the creation of Ruby symbols that were never garbage collected.
(CVE-2014-0082)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Kevin Reintjes as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0081, and Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0082.

All ruby193-rubygem-actionpack users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Synopsis

Critical: cfme security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0215)

## Topic

Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments, which are far more complex than physical ones. This
technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures
to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization
deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Ruby parsed floating point
numbers from their text representation. If an application using Ruby
accepted untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the application
to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
application. (CVE-2013-4164)

It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly
sanitize user-supplied values in the ServiceController. A remote attacker
could invoke arbitrary method calls in the application controller that, due
to a lack of sanitization, could allow access to private methods that could
possibly allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
(CVE-2014-0057)

It was found that several number conversion helpers in Action View did not
properly escape all their parameters. An attacker could use these flaws to
perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
data submitted by a user as parameters to the affected helpers.
(CVE-2014-0081)

A memory consumption issue was discovered in the text rendering component
of Action View. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
of service attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in
the creation of Ruby symbols that were never garbage collected.
(CVE-2014-0082)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting
CVE-2014-0081 and CVE-2014-0082. Upstream acknowledges Kevin Reintjes as
the original reporter of CVE-2014-0081, and Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the
original reporter of CVE-2014-0082. The CVE-2014-0057 issue was discovered
by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

This update fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
CloudForms 3.0 Management Engine 5.2 Technical Notes linked to in the
References section.

All users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
