## Synopsis

Low: rhevm-reports 3.3.3 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0558)

## Topic

An updated rhevm-reports package that fixes three security issues and one
bug is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization reports package provides a suite of
pre-configured reports and dashboards that enable you to monitor the
system. The reports module is based on JasperReports and JasperServer, and
can also be used to create ad-hoc reports.

It was found that the ovirt-engine-reports setup script logged the reports
database password in plain text to a world-readable file. An attacker with
a local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
server could use this flaw to access, read, and modify the reports
database. (CVE-2014-0199)

Note: Applying the update provided by this advisory does not modify any
existing log files. It is recommended that you search your existing log
files and remove any occurrences of plain text passwords manually.

It was found that the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager reports
datasource configuration file (js-jboss7-ds.xml) was world-readable.
An attacker with a local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager server could use this flaw to access, read, and
modify the reports database. (CVE-2014-0200)

It was found that multiple ovirt-engine-reports configuration files were
world-readable. An attacker with a local user account on the Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager server could use this flaw to access a
variety of potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0201)

These issues were discovered by Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, rhevm-reports-setup failed if the default spacing of the

pg\_hba.conf file was manually modified. Now, the command does not check
exact spacing in the file, and setup completes successfully. (BZ#1085374)

All rhevm-reports users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
