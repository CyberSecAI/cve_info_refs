# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM MessageSight (CVE-2014-0921, CVE-2014-0922, CVE-2014-0923, CVE-2014-0924)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

3 security vulnerabilities have been identified in IBM MessageSight V1.0 and V1.1 allowing a remote attacker to perform a denial of service attack.

## Vulnerability Details

**DESCRIPTION:**

When malformed headers are received as part of a WebSockets connection upgrade, there is a chance that the MessageSight server process will crash and then restart, resulting in the loss of all non-persistent messages. See APAR IC98583.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92074> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**DESCRIPTION:**

Vulnerability in the code responsible for handling MQTT over WebSockets might allow a remote attacker to consume system resources on the MessageSight server until it is restarted. See APAR IC98692.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92075> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**DESCRIPTION:**

Vulnerability in the code responsible for handling MQTT authentication can cause the MessageSight server to be restarted. See APAR IT00582.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92076> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**DESCRIPTION:**

IBM MessageSight contains a vulnerability that would allow a remote attacker to bypass security. The server only checks the first 8 characters of a password, thus ignoring any subsequent characters and giving an attacker control over the appliance. See APAR IT00583.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92077> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM MessageSight 1.0

IBM MessageSight 1.1

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the fix to all affected versions as soon as practical.

An updated firmware image containing the fix is available from [Fix Central: 1.1.0.0-IBM-IMA-IT01015](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?product=ibm/Other+software/MessageSight&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=1.1.0.0-IBM-IMA-IFIT01015&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http&source=fc).

This fix also addresses CVE-2014-0160 as described in [this technote](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21670203).
