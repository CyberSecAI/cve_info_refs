| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1082925#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-04-01 06:20:47 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg parsed certain image files from a JPEG2000 image. If a specially-crafted image were opened by an application linked against OpenJPEG, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1082925#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-04-01 06:29:47 UTC  ```   When decoding the specially-crafted image, tcd_decode_tile() fails at:  1400         if (tilec->data == NULL) 1401         { 1402             opj_event_msg(tcd->cinfo, EVT_ERROR, "Out of memory\n"); 1403             return OPJ_FALSE; 1404         }  It returns OPJ_FALSE, which is recorded into j2k->state in j2k_read_eoc() at:  1670                                 success = tcd_decode_tile(tcd, j2k->tile_data[tileno], j2k->tile_len[tileno], tileno, j2k->cstr_info);  .. ..  1677                         if (success == OPJ_FALSE) { 1678                                 j2k->state |= J2K_STATE_ERR; 1679                                 break;  However this error is not acknowledged by the upstream calling function j2k_decode() at:  2013         if (j2k->state == J2K_STATE_NEOC) { 2014                 j2k_read_eoc(j2k); 2015         } 2016   So the calling stack is:  j2k_decode()                   < Not acknowledged here! ----> j2k_read_eoc()           < Propagates here       ----> tcd_decode_tile()  < Error here  This results in the image being treated as valid, though it may be invalid, this can result in heap-buffer OOB read/write, depending on how the image is crafted   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1082925#c2)  Huzaifa S.
