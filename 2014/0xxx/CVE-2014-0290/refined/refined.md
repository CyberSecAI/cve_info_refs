        "vulnerability": "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability",
        "details": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",

        "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability or take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content.",
