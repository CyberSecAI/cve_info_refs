Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2014-0755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials within the Rockwell Automation RSLogix 5000 software. Specifically, user-defined passwords used to protect user-configured content within project files (.ACD) are vulnerable to compromise.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient protection of passwords used to safeguard user-configured content within RSLogix 5000 project files.
- Passwords can be compromised, potentially exposing user-created content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized disclosure of user-created content within RSLogix 5000 project files.
- While exploitation could reveal protected content, it will not directly disrupt the operation of Rockwell Automation programmable controllers or other devices in the control system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the password file is required for exploitation.
- User interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs a medium skill level to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must access the password file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RSLogix 5000 software versions V7 through V20.01, and V21.0.
- Rockwell Automation has released updated versions, V20.03 and V21.03, to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Project files created in older versions need to be opened, resaved, and downloaded using the updated software to apply the mitigation.
- Updated files are not compatible with older versions of the software.
- The advisory also suggests security practices such as: tracking of protected files, secure archiving, secure file transmission, restricting physical/network access, using unique and complex passwords, and periodic password changes.
