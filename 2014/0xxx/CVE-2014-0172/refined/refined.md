  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the size of a memory region for compressed debug sections in ELF files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious ELF file could cause an application using libdw to crash, potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious ELF file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User/automated system processing the malicious ELF file with an application linked against libdw."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of malformed compressed debug sections in ELF files. The `check_section()` function in `dwarf_begin_elf.c` does not properly check for integer overflows when calculating the size of memory to be allocated, leading to a smaller than expected heap allocation. This allocation is then overflowed with decompressed data, potentially corrupting memory. Patches were created to include checks for possible integer overflows."
