| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-22 21:41:50 UTC  ``` Robert Scheck discovered a flaw in Zarafa that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to crash the zarafa-server daemon, preventing access to any other legitimate Zarafa users.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Robert Scheck of ETES GmbH for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c2)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-24 13:27:55 UTC  ``` The issue affects all known Zarafa versions from at least Zarafa 5.00 up to (including) Zarafa 7.1.8 Beta 1. Zarafa 7.1.8 Beta 2 (and later) do not have this issue anymore. The first regular fixed release will be Zarafa 7.1.8.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c3)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-24 13:37:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 854977](attachment.cgi?id=854977&action=diff "Patch by ETES GmbH from 2013-10-18 (proposed to upstream)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=854977&action=edit "Patch by ETES GmbH from 2013-10-18 (proposed to upstream)") Patch by ETES GmbH from 2013-10-18 (proposed to upstream)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c4)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-24 13:41:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 854979](attachment.cgi?id=854979&action=diff "Relevant diff between 7.1.8beta1-42841 and 7.1.8beta2-43059") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=854979&action=edit "Relevant diff between 7.1.8beta1-42841 and 7.1.8beta2-43059") Relevant diff between 7.1.8beta1-42841 and 7.1.8beta2-43059   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c5)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-24 14:10:51 UTC  ``` From my point of view the cvss2 should be A:C rather A:P, but I might be wrong here. The zarafa-server process crashes with a backtrace (and even all other Zarafa related daemons are still running) there is no Zarafa functionality till zarafa-server daemon is started again. The zarafa-server process provides the MAPI in SOAP service required by all other Zarafa related components as shown: <http://doc.zarafa.com/trunk/Administrator_Manual/en-US/html/_architecture.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c6)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-24 16:19:05 UTC  ``` Thanks for all of this information, Robert.  In regards to the CVSSv2 scoring, please see:  <https://access.redhat.com/site/security/updates/classification/>  In particular the second last paragraph:  "Red Hat creates CVSSv2 scores against the entire Red Hat or Red Hat JBoss product, not against an individual component within the product. This is why you may often see differences between Red Hat scores and NVD or upstream scores. For instance, if there is a denial of service flaw against Apache, upstream may score it A:C (complete loss of availability) because their product is httpd. Red Hat would score this as A:P (partial loss of availability) because the underlying operating system (our product) is still available, while only one service is unavailable. Red Hat only uses A:C for flaws that would render the entire system unavailable (typically kernel flaws)."  This is why the CVSSv2 score is A:P, and not A:C, as in the context of the operating system itself, availability is only partially affected (taking out the Zarafa server does not take out the entire system).  From Zarafa's point of view, however, if they were to use CVSSv2 to rate this, they would likely use A:C.  I hope that explains it clearly enough.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c7)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-24 16:38:06 UTC  ``` Yes, indeed. I am sorry, I was not really aware about that specific paragraph.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c8)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-24 16:51:50 UTC  ``` No problem at all.  =)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c9)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-27 18:28:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 856182](attachment.cgi?id=856182&action=diff "upstream patch to correct the flaw") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856182&action=edit "upstream patch to correct the flaw") upstream patch to correct the flaw  Upstream provided this patch.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c10)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-28 00:58:06 UTC  ``` Even it does not make any difference for the source code itself, I would like  to mention that [attachment #856182](attachment.cgi?id=856182&action=diff "upstream patch to correct the flaw") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856182&action=edit "upstream patch to correct the flaw") (provided by upstream) is not identically to the code in 7.1.8rc1-43691 (which should get gold/final today) while attachment  #854979 (gathered from diff) is. So there was minor modification after upstream  SVN revision 42919 (and before SVN revision 43059).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c11)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-28 01:09:20 UTC  ``` Most users of Zarafa at Fedora and Fedora EPEL might be able to mitigate this  flaw by filtering Zarafa's MAPI in SOAP at the firewall or by adapting listen  settings in the Zarafa server configuration. However once legitimate remote  usage of MAPI in SOAP connectivity is required by the Zarafa setup, there is  no real alternative except a fixed Zarafa version.  I have already run test builds with Zarafa 7.1.8rc1-43691 (which includes new features and other bug fixes) and smoke tests for Fedora and Fedora EPEL, thus I am now just waiting for the availability of the final release.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767#c12)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-30 23:40:09 UTC  ``` Meanwhile Zarafa 7.1.8 final has been released.

Subject: Security Flaw CVE-2014-0037

CVE-2014-0037

Affected product: Zarafa Collaboration Platform <= 7.1.7

Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: Complete

A flaw in Zarafa has been discovered that allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to crash the zarafa-server daemon with a segmentation fault, preventing access to any other legitimate Zarafa users. This flaw has been fixed beginning with the release of Zarafa 7.1.8 beta2 ( <http://download.zarafa.com/community/beta/7.1/7.1.8beta2-43059/> ). We encourage any users of Zarafa to update to this new version or apply the patch supplied below.

Zarafa would like to thank Robert Scheck from ETES (<http://www.etes.de>) for discovering and reporting this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c0)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-30 21:59:49 UTC  ``` I discovered (aside [bug #1056767](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0037 zarafa: unauthenticated denial of service flaw")) another flaw in Zarafa that could allow a  remote unauthenticated attacker to crash the zarafa-server daemon, preventing  access to any other legitimate Zarafa users.  The issue affects all Zarafa versions from at least Zarafa 6.20.0 (maybe even from at least Zarafa 5.00) up to (including) Zarafa 7.1.8 final. Please note that I was not able to crash the zarafa-server daemon using official upstream Zarafa binary packages just all community builds from the source code such as  shipped in Fedora. This different behaviour might be caused that upstream uses different built-time flags or other system libraries and headers.  Once the zarafa-server process crashes with a backtrace (and even all other Zarafa related daemons are still running) there is no Zarafa functionality till zarafa-server daemon is started again. The zarafa-server process provides the MAPI in SOAP service required by all other Zarafa related components as shown: <http://doc.zarafa.com/trunk/Administrator_Manual/en-US/html/_architecture.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c1)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-30 22:11:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 857652](attachment.cgi?id=857652&action=diff "Patch suggestion (applicable to Zarafa 7.1.8 Beta 2 and later)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=857652&action=edit "Patch suggestion (applicable to Zarafa 7.1.8 Beta 2 and later)") Patch suggestion (applicable to Zarafa 7.1.8 Beta 2 and later)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c2)  Robert Scheck    2014-01-30 23:42:15 UTC  ``` While updating Zarafa 7.1.8 (due to [bug #1056767](show_bug.cgi?id=1056767 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0037 zarafa: unauthenticated denial of service flaw")) I included the patch from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c1) and now there are fixed builds for all active branches of Fedora and Fedora EPEL and were submitted via Bodhi:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/zarafa-7.1.8-1.fc20> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/zarafa-7.1.8-1.fc19> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/zarafa-7.1.8-1.el6> [https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/zarafa-7.1.8-1.el5,php53-mapi-7.1.8-1.el5](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/zarafa-7.1.8-1.el5%2Cphp53-mapi-7.1.8-1.el5)  Unfortunately I am not able to reference this bug in Bodhi until the embargo has been removed ("You are not authorized to access [bug #1059903](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0079 zarafa: unauthenticated denial of service flaw")").   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-31 18:49:52 UTC  ``` Hi, Robert.  Thanks for filing this.  This is the second issue you had referred to, correct?  And not at all related to [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) right?  Upstream is still unaware of this one?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-31 18:52:14 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Robert Scheck of ETES GmbH for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c5)  Robert Scheck    2014-02-01 00:38:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c3)) > Hi, Robert.  Thanks for filing this.  This is the second issue you had > referred to, correct?  And not at all related to [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) right?  Yes, this is the second issue. This issue is similar - maybe you can simply have a look to the patch of this one and that one of CVE-2014-0037: This one  refers to a NULL pointer of the password, the [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) refers to a NULL  pointer of the username. Obviously the exploitation is quite similar, too.  You still can exploit this issue even when [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) is fixed (and also the other way round). The two issues are related that way that they are both in the same source code functions and both related to authentication data. Do these information help you? If you say that these should be treated like one issue, let's do it...I'm not an expert here. I am also sorry that I did not figure out this issue already months ago (but upstream did neither).  > Upstream is still unaware of this one?  I noticed upstream yesterday evening via e-mail about the issue including the patch and also the fact that Fedora is shipping the patch already - see: <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/zarafa.git/tree/zarafa-7.1.8-nullptr.patch> Unfortunately there was no reply by upstream so far. Shall I send a reminder having the RHSRT on Cc?  Does it make sense to keep this one embargoed (as the patch is public)? I marked this only as such because the referenced [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) was embargoed at the time of opening this one. If you manage to exploit [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) it is more than trivial to exploit this issue, too.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c6)  Robert Scheck    2014-02-09 23:30:59 UTC  ``` Vincent, I sent an e-mail to upstream having the RHSRT on Cc about a week ago but did not get any objections. Can you please make a decision if this worth  another CVE or not, but would you anyway please lift the embargo afterwards?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-12 23:59:54 UTC  ``` Sorry for the delay on this one.  Yes, it needs another CVE (as [CVE-2014-0037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0037) was fixed, this one was not, doesn't matter if it's in the same function or found by the same person (had they been fixed at the same time it would have been a different story)).  This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2014-0079](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0079).  When you communicate this to upstream, can you let them know the CVE name as well please?  I can lift the embargo whenever you like.  It might be nice to let upstream know before we do though, so I'm not going to open it now.  Please give me an explicit ack to opening this bug and I will do so.  Thanks (and my apologies again for the delay).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c8)  Robert Scheck    2014-02-13 01:33:21 UTC  ``` Vincent, thank you very much for taking care! And don't worry about the delay.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1059903#c9)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-14 15:37:07 UTC  ``` This has been already corrected in the recent Zarafa 7.1.8 builds with this patch:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/zarafa.git/tree/zarafa-7.1.8-nullptr.patch?h=f20>  So currently-supported Fedora is no longer vulnerable in this version.   ``` |  |
