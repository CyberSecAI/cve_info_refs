WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any speciﬁc mitigations or workarounds.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM APE serves as an utility-grade computing platform for the RUGGEDCOM RX1500 router
family.
It also allows to run third party software applications without needing to procure an external
industrial PC.

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1, CP 1543SP-1, CP 1542SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC communication processors
connects the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions such as
ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

ROX-based VPN endpoints and ﬁrewall devices are used to connect devices that operate in harsh
environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The client-server HMI (human machine interface) system SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part
of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in applications requiring a high degree of customer-
speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements
or functions.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-0224

An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a vulnerable client and a
vulnerable server. This vulnerability affects ROX, APE, S7-1500 and CP1543-1.

## Known issues

### Non APAR Defect 13042 - ISM agent doesn't start after upgrading Windows Box

**Problem Description**
  The Windows ISM agent is stopped after an upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support changes to define old and new agent registry keys.
 **Workaround**
  Reconfigure the ISM agent after the upgrade to resolve the problem.

### Non APAR Defect 10767 - ISM support file upgrades overwrites ismconfig.props

**Problem Description**
  ISM support files upgrades overwrite ismconfig.props. Note: ISM monitor props files are NOT overwritten.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support not overwriting ismconfig.props.
 **Workaround**
  Backup the ismconfig.props file before performing an upgrade of ISM support.

### Non APAR Defect 13701 - ismconfig.cmd fails to accept multiple white space enclosed in quotes(") in SOAP parameters

**Problem Description**
  ismconfig.cmd truncates multiple white spaces in SOAP parameters. For example the following SOAPInputs: @SOAPInputs [itinerary:{from:string,dest:string}[]=[{from='Perth,\" \",Australia',dest='Sydney'}]]"
 **Root cause**
  This problem is due to the command line interpretation of escaping the quotation character.
 **Workaround**
  Write command into a text file and use the ismconfig.cmd -file command to import the command(s).

### Non APAR Defect 14498 - Internet Service Monitor 7.3.0.1 upgrade fails with no existing image to upgrade error

**Problem Description**
  When upgrading the ISM the upgrade can fail with the following error:
 mkdir: 0653-357 Cannot access directory /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses.
 /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 cp: /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses/isv730: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 KCIIN2593E
 The CD you are trying to install is a fixpack CD and cannot be installed on a machine without an existing image to upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installation script expects the following directory to exist in the previous installation: $CANDLEHOME/licenses

 If this doesn't exists it cannot detect the previous ISM installation correctly causing the upgrade to stop.
 **Workaround**
  Create the $CANDLEHOME/licenses directory and re-run the installation.
 Refer to the [technote](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618763) for more information.

## Known limitations

### Non APAR Defect 16289 - Remote Upgrade

**Problem Description**
  Remote upgrades using the tacmd updateAgent command on Linux x86\_64 fails. Please use a local installation for this Operating System.
### Change of Summarized Data

**Problem Description**
  After upgrading earlier versions of the ISM application, summarized data may not be visible, since the summarization behaviour has changed. This issue can be resolved by re-summarizing your existing detailed data. Please refer to this [technote](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443517) for more information.
### SOAP Monitor Does Not Support Nested Arrays or multiRef Values

**Problem Description**
  The SOAP monitor is unable to handle parameters containing nested (two or more dimension) arrays or those that are referenced externally in the 'multiRef' style.
## Installation information

For AIX, if upgrading from an ISM 6.0.1 release, you must uninstall the product and perform a new install. This does not apply for other ISM 6 releases. For more information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21321186>

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.3.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.3.0.1. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.30.01.29'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

KB 7015264

# OpenSSL Security Advisory (05 June 2014) and Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1.

* **Document ID:***7015264*
* **Creation Date:**23-Jun-2014
* **Modified Date:**01-Jul-2014
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Open Enterprise Server
  + **SUSE Products:**SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

## Environment

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 2 (SLES 11 SP2)
Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 Linux Support Pack 1 (OES 11 SP1)

## Situation

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 General support has ended on 31 Jan 2014.
Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1 General support ends on 29 Jan 2015.

On 05 June 2014, a OpenSSL Security Advisory was published, detailing a set of OpenSSL related vulnerabilities for which customers are advised to upgrade.
Due to the current support status for Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1, the Novell and SUSE teams have closely collaborated to make these fix available for Novell OES11 SP1 customers.

## Resolution

 The oes11sp1-openssl-9354 patch containing mentioned fixes for OpenSSL on SLES 11 SP2  is released through the public OES11 SP1 patch repositories on June 23, 2014.

The following security issues were fixed with this patch (bnc#880891) :

- SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)
- DTLS recursion flaw (CVE-2014-0221)
- Anonymous ECDH denial of service (CVE-2014-3470)
- Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack the nonces could have been recovered (CVE-2014-0076)

Other issues which are also fixed in this release :

-
Ensures that the stack is marked non-executable on x86 32bit. On other
processor platforms it was already marked as non-executable before
(bnc#870192).
- IPv6 support was added to the openssl s\_client and s\_server command line tool (bnc#859228).
-
The openssl command line tool now checks certificates by default
against /etc/ssl/certs (this can be changed via the -CApath option)
(bnc#860332).
- The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange
selector was enabled and can be selected by kECDHE, kECDH, ECDH tags in
the SSL cipher string (bnc#859924).
- If an optional openssl1 command
line tool is installed in parallel, c\_rehash uses it to generate
certificate hashes in both OpenSSL 0 and OpenSSL 1 style. This allows
parallel usage of OpenSSL 0.9.8j and OpenSSL 1.x client libraries with a
shared certificate store (bnc#862181).

## Cause

 Multiple OpenSSL related security vulnerabilities.

             CVE-2013-4238
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vSphere product updates address a Cross Site Scripting issue,
   a certificate validation issue and security vulnerabilities in
   third-party libraries.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server Appliance 5.1 Prior to Update 3

   VMware vCenter Server 5.5 prior to Update 2
   VMware vCenter Server 5.1 prior to Update 3

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM
      service.

RHSA-2014:0632 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2014-06-05
Updated:
2014-06-05
# RHSA-2014:0632 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the openssl component for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 that
fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
(mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
Native library.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Web Server includes OpenSSL 0.9.8e, so this flaw is
only exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss Web Server is used as a client,
communicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version 1.0.1 and
above. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web
Server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications
and configuration files).

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Web Server Text-Only Advisories x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1103586](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1103586)

# CVE-2014-0198

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0197.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0203.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0198 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0198)

#### Description

The do\_ssl3\_write function in s3\_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.x through 1.0.1g, when SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS is enabled, does not properly manage a buffer pointer during certain recursive calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via vectors that trigger an alert condition.

Issued:

Updated:
2014-06-05
# RHSA-2014:0631 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 that
fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform includes OpenSSL
0.9.8e, so this flaw is only exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss EAP is used
as a client, communicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version
1.0.1 and above. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and
deployed applications (including all applications and configuration files).

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Text-Only Advisories x86\_64

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

before 1.0.1h did not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec
messages, which allowed man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a
zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a
crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability
(bnc#915913).

in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h,
when an anonymous ECDH cipher suite is used, allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client crash) by
triggering a NULL certificate value (bnc#915913).

MariaDB 5.5.28a, 5.3.11, 5.2.13, 5.1.66, and possibly other versions,
generates different error messages with different time delays depending
on whether a user name exists, which allowed remote attackers to
enumerate valid usernames (bnc#915913).
- CVE-2014-4274: Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL Server 5.5.38
and earlier and 5.6.19 and earlier allowed local users to affect

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0624)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Customer reviewsXNews coverage

The most reliable and versatile information security software on the market, reacts immediately to threats and the notification appears on the screen immediately.

– F‑Secure Total customer

It just seems to work well in the back­ground and F‑Secure have kept my computers safe for many years.

– F-Secure Internet Security Customer

Works and is reliable, just great!

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated openssl097a and openssl098e packages that fix one security issue
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 respectively.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt

HP recommends the following mitigation information to protect against
potential risk for the following HP IceWall products.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw and MCRP

If possible, do not use SHOST setting which allows IceWall SSO Dfw or MCRP to
use SSL/TLS for back-end web server connection.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw Certd

If possible, set LDAPSSL to 0 to make HP SSO IceWall Certd to not use SSL/TLS
on any connection with LDAP server.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1103586#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-06-02 07:17:00 UTC  ``` It was found that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability. An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server.  As per the upstream advisory:  The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client *and* server. OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL. Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1. Users of OpenSSL servers earlier than 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade as a precaution.  OpenSSL 0.9.8 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 0.9.8za. OpenSSL 1.0.0 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.0m. OpenSSL 1.0.1 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.1h.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1103586#c4)  Huzaifa S.

An update that fixes 37 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for libopenssl0\_9\_8 fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- The package was updated to 0.9.8zh:
\* fixes many security vulnerabilities (not seperately listed):
CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-1788, CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-1790,
CVE-2015-1792, CVE-2015-1791, CVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287,
CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0293, CVE-2015-0209, CVE-2015-0288,
CVE-2014-3571, CVE-2014-3569, CVE-2014-3572, CVE-2015-0204,
CVE-2014-8275, CVE-2014-3570, CVE-2014-3567, CVE-2014-3568,
CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-3510, CVE-2014-3507, CVE-2014-3506,
CVE-2014-3505, CVE-2014-3508, CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0221,
CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2014-0076, CVE-2013-0169,
CVE-2013-0166
- avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading.
(boo#952871, boo#967787)
- fix CVE-2015-3197 (boo#963415)
\* SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers

## Error description

* ```
  A security vulnerability in ChangeCipherSpec processing allows
  intermediate nodes to intercept encrypted data and decrypt them
  and can force the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients
  and servers.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the
  use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. This

# Re: More OpenSSL issues

Yeah, definitely not in the same ballpark as heartbleed fortunately.

I have posted a detection script on the Tripwire blog to identify servers
permitting the early CCS:
<http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/incident-detection/detection-script-for-cve-2014-0224-openssl-cipher-change-spec-injection/>

It should detect potentially vulnerable hosts with a variety of
configurations.

Thanks,
Craig

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0627)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.3 and 6.4 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Early ChangeCipherSpec Attack](/2014/06/05/earlyccs.html) (05 Jun 2014)

OpenSSL 1.0.1h (and others) were [released today](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt) with a scary looking security advisiory and that's always an event worth looking into. (Hopefully people are practiced at updating OpenSSL now!)

**Update**: the original reporter has a [blog post](http://ccsinjection.lepidum.co.jp/blog/2014-06-05/CCS-Injection-en/index.html) up. Also, I won't, personally, be answering questions about specific Google services. (I cut this blog post together from notes that I'm writing for internal groups to evaluate and this is still very fresh.)

**Update**: my initial thoughts from looking at the diff still seem to be holding up. Someone is welcome to write a more detailed analysis than below. HP/ZDI have a [write up](http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Security-Research-Blog/ZDI-14-173-CVE-2014-0195-OpenSSL-DTLS-Fragment-Out-of-Bounds/ba-p/6501002#.U5Cjpnmx3UY) of one of the DTLS issues.

There are some critical bug fixes to DTLS (TLS over datagram transports, i.e. UDP), but most people will be more concerned about the MITM attack against TLS (CVE-2014-0224).

The code changes are around the rejection of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which are messages sent during the TLS handshake that mark the change from unencrypted to encrypted traffic. These messages aren't part of the handshake protocol itself and aren't linked into the handshake state machine in OpenSSL. Rather there's a check in the code that they are only received when a new cipher is ready to be used. However, that check (for s->s3->tmp.new\_cipher in s3\_pkt.c) seems reasonable, but new\_cipher is actually set as soon as the cipher for the connection has been decided (i.e. once the ServerHello message has been sent/received), not when the cipher is actually ready! It looks like this is the problem that's getting fixed in this release.

Here's the code in question that handles a ChangeCipherSpec message:

```

int ssl3_do_change_cipher_spec(SSL *s)
	{
	int i;
	const char *sender;
	int slen;

	if (s->state & SSL_ST_ACCEPT)
		i=SSL3_CHANGE_CIPHER_SERVER_READ;
	else
		i=SSL3_CHANGE_CIPHER_CLIENT_READ;

	if (s->s3->tmp.key_block == NULL)1
		{
		if (s->session == NULL)
			{
			/* might happen if dtls1_read_bytes() calls this */
			SSLerr(SSL_F_SSL3_DO_CHANGE_CIPHER_SPEC,SSL_R_CCS_RECEIVED_EARLY);
			return (0);
			}

		s->session->cipher=s->s3->tmp.new_cipher;
		if (!s->method->ssl3_enc->setup_key_block(s)) return(0); 2
		}

	if (!s->method->ssl3_enc->change_cipher_state(s,i))
		return(0);

	/* we have to record the message digest at
	 * this point so we can get it before we read
	 * the finished message */
	if (s->state & SSL_ST_CONNECT)
		{
		sender=s->method->ssl3_enc->server_finished_label;
		slen=s->method->ssl3_enc->server_finished_label_len;
		}
	else
		{
		sender=s->method->ssl3_enc->client_finished_label;
		slen=s->method->ssl3_enc->client_finished_label_len;
		}

	i = s->method->ssl3_enc->final_finish_mac(s,
		sender,slen,s->s3->tmp.peer_finish_md); 3
	if (i == 0)
		{
		SSLerr(SSL_F_SSL3_DO_CHANGE_CIPHER_SPEC, ERR_R_INTERNAL_ERROR);
		return 0;
		}
	s->s3->tmp.peer_finish_md_len = i;

	return(1);
	}

```

If a ChangeCipherSpec message is injected into the connection after the ServerHello, but before the master secret has been generated, then ssl3\_do\_change\_cipher\_spec will generate the keys (2) and the expected Finished hash (3) for the handshake with an *empty* master secret. This means that both are based only on public information. Additionally, the keys will be latched because of the check at (1) - further ChangeCipherSpec messages will regenerate the expected Finished hash, but not the keys.

The oldest source code on the OpenSSL site is for 0.9.1c (Dec 28, 1998) and the affected code appears almost unchanged. So it looks like this bug has existed for 15+ years.

The implications of this are pretty complex.

For a client there's an additional check in the code that requires that a CCS message appear before the Finished and after the master secret has been generated. An attacker can still inject an early CCS too and the keys will be calculated with an empty master secret. Those keys will be latched - another CCS won't cause them to be recalculated. However, when sending the second CCS that the client code requires, the Finished hash is recalculated with the correct master secret. This means that the attacker can't fabricate an acceptable Finished hash. This stops the obvious, generic impersonation attack against the client.

For a server, there's no such check and it appears to be possible to send an early CCS message and then fabricate the Finished hash because it's based on an empty master secret. However, that doesn't obviously gain an attacker anything. It would be interesting if a connection with a client certificate could be hijacked, but there is a check in ssl3\_get\_cert\_verify that a CCS hasn't been already processed so that isn't possible.

Someone may be able to do something more creative with this bug; I'm not ruling out that there might be other implications.

Things change with an OpenSSL 1.0.1 server however. In 1.0.1, a patch of mine was included that moves the point where Finished values are calculated. The server will now use the correct Finished hash even if it erroneously processed a CCS, but this interacts badly with this bug. The server code (unlike the client) won't accept two CCS messages in a handshake. So, if an attacker injects an early CCS at the server to fixate the bad keys, then it's not possible for them to send a second in order to get it to calculate the correct Finished hash. But with 1.0.1, the server will use the correct Finished hash and will reply with the correct hash to the client. This explains the 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 mention in the advisory. With any OpenSSL client talking to an OpenSSL 1.0.1 server, an attacker can inject CCS messages to fixate the bad keys at both ends but the Finished hashes will still line up. So it's possible for the attacker to decrypt and/or hijack the connection completely.

The good news is that these attacks need man-in-the-middle position against the victim and that non-OpenSSL clients (IE, Firefox, Chrome on Desktop and iOS, Safari etc) aren't affected. None the less, all OpenSSL users should be updating.

**Update**: I hacked up the Go TLS library to perform the broken handshake in both 0.9.8/1.0.0 and 1.0.1 modes. There's [a patch](/binary/earlyccs_tls.patch) for crypto/tls and [a tool](/binary/earlyccs_check.go) that will attempt to do those broken handshakes and tell you if either worked. For example (at the time of writing):

```
$ ./earlyccs_check google.com
Handshake failed with error: remote error: unexpected message
Looks ok.
$ ./earlyccs_check github.com
Server is affected (1.0.1).
$ ./earlyccs_check amazon.com
Server is affected (0.9.8 or 1.0.0).
```

## OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack

#### Vulnerability Note VU#978508

Original Release Date: 2014-06-05 | Last Revised: 2015-10-27

---

### Overview

OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Description

| The OpenSSL security advisory states:  *SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)**===========================================**An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server.**The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client \*and\* server. OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL. Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1. Users of OpenSSL servers earlier than 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade as a precaution.**OpenSSL 0.9.8 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 0.9.8za.**OpenSSL 1.0.0 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.0m.**OpenSSL 1.0.1 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.1h.**Thanks to KIKUCHI Masashi (Lepidum Co. Ltd.) for discovering and researching this issue. This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 1st May 2014 via JPCERT/CC.**The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team partly based on an original patch from KIKUCHI Masashi.*Additional details may be found in the [OpenSSL security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt). This vulnerability is one of many that has been fixed in the latest release.Masashi Kikuchi has written a [technical blog post](http://ccsinjection.lepidum.co.jp/blog/2014-06-05/CCS-Injection-en/index.html) about the vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with a man-in-the-middle vantage point on the network may be able to decrypt or modify traffic between a client and server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**OpenSSL 0.9.8 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 0.9.8za.OpenSSL 1.0.0 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.0m.OpenSSL 1.0.1 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.1h. |

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201407-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, possibly
allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1h-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1h-r1**revision >= **1.0.0m**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p1**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p2**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p3**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p4**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p5**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p6**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p7**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p8**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p9**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p10**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p11**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p12**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p13**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p14**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p15** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 Jun 2014] and the CVE identifiers
referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted DTLS fragments to an
OpenSSL DTLS client or server to possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process using OpenSSL.

Furthermore, an attacker could force the use of weak keying material in
OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers, inject data across sessions, or
cause a Denial of Service via various vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1h-r1"

```

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.3 |

# CVE-2014-0195

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0191.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0196.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0195 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0195)

#### Description

The dtls1\_reassemble\_fragment function in d1\_both.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a long non-initial fragment.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

[CVSS v2 Scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm)
|  | National Vulnerability Database |
| Base Score | 6.8 |
| Vector | AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P |
| Access Vector | Network |
| Access Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality Impact | Partial |
| Integrity Impact | Partial |
| Availability Impact | Partial |

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

According to our research, openssl before 0.9.8o is not affected by this overflow problem. The DTLS fragment reassembly was rewritten for 0.9.8o and older versions used different methods. So openssl 0.9.8j as used by SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and older versions are not affected. Please also not that this problem only affects the Datagram TLS (over UDP) not the regular TLS over TCP which is more common.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [880891](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=880891) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [885777](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=885777) [RESOLVED / INVALID], [915913](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915913) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# Splunk 6.0.3 addresses two vulnerabilities

**Advisory ID:** SP-CAAAM2D

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-3470](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-3470)

**Published:** 2014-07-01

**Last Update:** 2014-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** -,

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [-](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#-)

**CWE:** [-](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/.html)

**Bug ID:** SPL-85063, SPL-85063

## Description

Splunk Enterprise versions 6.1.2, 6.0.5 and 5.0.9 address the following two OpenSSL vulnerabilities:

* OpenSSL susceptible to man-in-the-middle via CCS Injection (SPL-85063, CVE-2014-0224)
* OpenSSL anonymous ECDH cipher suite contains weakness (SPL-85063, CVE-2014-3470)

At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Previous Product Security Announcements can be found on our Splunk Product Security Portal. Use SPL numbers when referencing issues in communication with Splunk. If there is no CVE Identifier listed with a vulnerability, it will be added once it is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority. To standardize the calculation of severity scores for each vulnerability, when appropriate, Splunk uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2.

## Affected Products and Components

The security vulnerabilities addressed by these maintenance releases affect indexers, search heads, forwarders, deployment servers, and license servers in the following versions:

* SPL-85063: All versions of Splunk Enterprise prior to 6.1.2, 6.0.5 and 5.0.9.
  ## Mitigation and Upgrades

To mitigate this issue, Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest release and applying as many of the Hardening Standards from the Securing Splunk documentation as are relevant to your environment. Splunk releases are cumulative, meaning that future releases will contain fixes to these vulnerabilities, new features and other bug fixes.

## Vulnerability Descriptions and Ratings

### OpenSSL susceptible to man-in-the-middle via CCS Injection (SPL-85063, CVE-2014-0224)

**Description**: OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the “CCS Injection” vulnerability.

#### CVSS Severity (version 2.0):

**CVSS Base Score 6.8**

CVSS Impact Subscore 6.4

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 8.6

**Overall CVSS Score 6.8**

### OpenSSL anonymous ECDH cipher suite contains weakness (SPL-85063, CVE-2014-3470)

**Description**: The ssl3\_send\_client\_key\_exchange function in s3\_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h, when an anonymous ECDH cipher suite is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client crash) by triggering a NULL certificate value.

#### CVSS Severity (version 6.0):

**CVSS Base Score 4.3**

CVSS Impact Subscore 2.9

CVSS Exploitability Subscore 8.6

**Overall CVSS Score 4.3**

## Topic

Updated openssl098e packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

KB 7015300

# OpenSSL Security Advisory (05 June 2014) and Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3.

* **Document ID:***7015300*
* **Creation Date:**01-Jul-2014
* **Modified Date:**01-Jul-2014
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Open Enterprise Server
  + **SUSE Products:**SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

## Environment

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 4 (SLES 10 SP4)
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 Linux Support Pack 3 (OES 2 SP3)
## Situation

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 General support has ended on 31 July 2013.
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3 General support has ended on  31 July 2013.

On
05 June 2014, a OpenSSL Security Advisory was published, detailing a
set of OpenSSL related vulnerabilities for which customers are advised
to upgrade.
Due to the current extended support status for Novell Open
Enterprise Server 2 SP3, the Novell and SUSE teams have closely
collaborated to make these fix available for Novell OES2 SP3 customers.
## Resolution

 The oes2p3-openssl-8895 patch containing mentioned fixes for OpenSSL on SLES 10 SP4 is released
through the public OES2 SP3 patch repositories on June 25, 2014.

The following security issues were fixed with this patch (bnc#880891) :

- SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)
- DTLS recursion flaw (CVE-2014-0221)
- Anonymous ECDH denial of service (CVE-2014-3470)
- Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack the nonces could have been recovered (CVE-2014-0076)

Other issues which are also fixed in this release :

-
Ensures that the stack is marked non-executable on x86 32bit. On other
processor platforms it was already marked as non-executable before
(bnc#870192).
- IPv6 support was added to the openssl s\_client and s\_server command line tool (bnc#859228).
-
The openssl command line tool now checks certificates by default
against /etc/ssl/certs (this can be changed via the -CApath option)
(bnc#860332).
- The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange
selector was enabled and can be selected by kECDHE, kECDH, ECDH tags in
the SSL cipher string (bnc#859924).
- If an optional openssl1 command
line tool is installed in parallel, c\_rehash uses it to generate
certificate hashes in both OpenSSL 0 and OpenSSL 1 style. This allows
parallel usage of OpenSSL 0.9.8j and OpenSSL 1.x client libraries with a
shared certificate store (bnc#862181).

## Cause

 Multiple OpenSSL related security vulnerabilities.

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)
 [Installing on Linux or UNIX systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_unix_itcam.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.4.0.0. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.40.00.13'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Troubleshooting installation problems from the Support site

For more detailed information, refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_install_chapter.html>

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

For detailed instructions, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_uninstall_chapter.html>

Run the following command on your DMA Core and DMA targets to determine what
version of OpenSSL is being used by the operating system:

$ rpm -qa | grep OpenSSL

Upgrade the Client and/or Server to the following versions:

OpenSSL 0.9.8 (All versions) to 0.9.8za
OpenSSL 1.0.0 (all versions) to 1.0.0m
OpenSSL 1.0.1(all versions) to 1.0.1h

#### *This article was originally published on the Red Hat Customer Portal. The information may no longer be current.*

In the last few years, several serious security issues have been discovered in various cryptographic libraries. Though very few of them were actually exploited in the wild before details were made public and patches were shipped, important issues like Heartbleed have led developers, researchers, and users to take code sanity of these products seriously.

Among the recent issues fixed by the OpenSSL project in version 1.0.1h, the main one that will have everyone talking is the "Man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attack, documented by CVE-2014-0224, affecting the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

## What is CVE-2014-0224 and should I really be worried about it?

The short answer is: it depends. But like any security flaw, its always safer to patch rather than defer and worry.

In order for an attacker to exploit this flaw, the following conditions need to be present.

* Both the client and the server must be vulnerable. All versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable on the client side. Only 1.0.1 and above are currently known to be vulnerable on the server side. If either the client or the server is fixed, it is not feasible to perform this attack.
* A Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacker: An attacker capable of intercepting and modifying packets off the wire. A decade back, this attack vector seemed almost impossible for anyone but Internet Service Providers as they had access to all the network devices through which most of the traffic on the internet passed.

However with the prevalence of various public wireless access points, easily available at cafes, restaurants, and even free internet access provided by some cities, MITM is now possible. Additionally, there is a variety of software available that provides the capability of faking Access Points. Once clients connect to the fake AP, an attacker could then act as a MITM for the client's traffic. A successful MITM attack may disclose authentication credentials, sensitive information, or give the attacker the ability to impersonate the victim.

## How does this attack work?

SSL/TLS sessions are initiated with the ClientHello and ServerHello handshake messages sent from the respective side. This part of the protocol is used to negotiate the attributes of the session, such as protocol version used, encryption protocol, encryption keys, Message Authentication Code (MAC) secrets and Initializaton Vectors (IV), as well as the extensions supported.

For various reasons, the client or the server may decide to modify the ciphering strategies of the connection during the handshake stage (don't confuse this with the handshake protocol). This can be achieved by using the ChangeCipherSpec (CCS) request. The CCS consists of a single packet which is sent by both the client and the server to notify that the subsequent records will be protected under the newly negotiated CipherSpec and keys.

As per the standards (RFC 2246, RFC 5246) "The ChangeCipherSpec message is sent during the handshake after the security parameters have been agreed upon, but before the verifying Finished message is sent.". This however did not happen with OpenSSL, and it accepted a CCS even before the security parameters were agreed upon. It is expected that accepting CCS out of order results in the state between both sides being desynchronized. Usually this should result in both sides effectively terminating the connection, unless you have another flaw present.

In order to exploit this issue, a MITM attacker would effectively do the following:

* Wait for a new TLS connection, followed by the ClientHello / ServerHello handshake messages.
* Issue a CCS packet in both the directions, which causes the OpenSSL code to use a zero length pre master secret key. The packet is sent to both ends of the connection. Session Keys are derived using a zero length pre master secret key, and future session keys also share this weakness.
* Renegotiate the handshake parameters.
* The attacker is now able to decrypt or even modify the packets in transit.

OpenSSL patched this vulnerability by changing how it handles when CCS packets are received, and how it handles zero length pre master secret values. The OpenSSL patch ensures that is is no longer possible to use master keys with zero length. It also ensures that CCS packets cannot be received before the master key has been set.

## What is the remedy?

The easiest solution is to ensure you are using the latest version of OpenSSL your distribution provides. Red Hat has issued security advisories for all of its affected products, and Fedora users should also be able to update their openssl packages to a patched version.

You will need to restart any services using OpenSSL that are not restarted automatically.

If you are a Red Hat customer, there is a tool available located at <https://access.redhat.com/labs/ccsinjectiontest/> which you can use to remotely verify the latest patches have been applied and your TLS server is responding correctly.

# OpenSSL CCS Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224) Alert

Updated 2016-05-20T18:00:42+00:00 -
English

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/articles/904433)
* [Korean](https://access.redhat.com/ko/articles/909973)
* [Japanese](https://access.redhat.com/ja/articles/910043)

Red Hat was recently notified of a vulnerability affecting all versions of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat products. [CVE-2014-0224](/security/cve/CVE-2014-0224) could allow for a man-in-the-middle attack against an encrypted connection.

SSL/TLS connections typically allow for encrypted traffic to pass between two parties where only the intended senders and recipients can decrypt data. In the event of a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker could intercept an encrypted data stream allowing them to decrypt, view and then manipulate said data.

The vulnerability can only be exploited if both server and client are vulnerable to this issue. In the event that one of the two is vulnerable, there is no risk of exploitation.

 **NOTE: This vulnerability cannot be used to extract server or client side key material. This means that existing signed certificates do not need replacement once software is updated.**

## How does this impact systems

This issue affects products using OpenSSL.

All versions prior to those listed as updates for this issue are vulnerable to some degree.

See the appropriate remediation article for specifics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ is for the vulnerability CVE-2014-0224 in OpenSSL, also known as "CCS Injection".

### Is this issue the same as HeartBleed?

No, this a new issue discovered in OpenSSL that could result in a man-in-the-middle attack. See the explanation above for full details.

### Is this issue worse than HeartBleed?

HeartBleed allowed anyone on the internet to exploit vulnerable servers. This issue requires an attacker to intercept and alter network traffic in real time in order to exploit the flaw. This reduces the risk that this vulnerability can be exploited but does not make it impossible, updating should be a primary remediation focus regardless of the difficulty in leveraging the exploit.

### Do I need to regenerate any certificates?

No, this issue does not result in certificate or private key information leaking.

### How can I tell if I'm vulnerable to this issue? Is it possible to test remotely for the presence of this issue?

All versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable to this issue. Review the relevant solution for your product:

[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/site/solutions/905793)

[Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization](/site/solutions/906913)

[Red Hat JBoss Middleware](/site/solutions/906533)

[Red Hat Storage](/site/solutions/906703)

Red Hat Access Labs has released the [CCS Injection Detector](/labs/ccsinjectiontest/) to you validate your systems have been patched against this vulnerability.

### How can I verify the update is working properly?

You can use the Access Labs [CCS Injection Detector](/labs/ccsinjectiontest/) to verify the update has been applied successfully.

### Is there a way to mitigate this issue without an update?

There is no known mitigation for this issue. The only way to fix it is to install updated OpenSSL packages and restart affected services.

### Does this issue affect other TLS libraries?

Red Hat has reviewed the NSS and GnuTLS libraries for this issue. We have determined that these libraries are not affected by this specific issue.

### Do I need to update my OpenSSL package, even if I am not running version 1.0.1?

Red Hat suggests everyone updates their OpenSSL packages regardless of the version they are using. See above for further details.

### Is this issue being exploited in the wild?

At the time the issue was made public, we were not aware of any public exploits for this issue or that it is being exploited in the wild. We believe an exploit could be written for this issue, however exploitation requires the attacker to intercept and alter network traffic in real time.

### When did Red Hat find out about this issue?

The OpenSSL team was notified about this issue on May 1, 2014, and contacted Red Hat and other OS distributions on June 2, 2014. This issue was made public on June 5, 2014.

### What can an attacker actually do with this issue?

This issue could allow an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against a vulnerable OpenSSL client communicating with a vulnerable OpenSSL server. The attacker could then potentially view or modify the secured traffic. The attacker would need a way to access network traffic between the communicating parties and alter it. This OpenSSL issue alone does not provide such level of access to network traffic.

### Why do Red Hat's security advisories list multiple CVE IDs?

OpenSSL is fixing several issues with their latest update. Red Hat's updates fix the issues as relevant to our various versions of OpenSSL. This issue has been singled out as the most serious and we are providing additional information.

RESOLUTION
On June 5th 2014, OpenSSL.org issued an advisory with several CVE
vulnerabilities. HP Networking is working to release fixes for these
vulnerabilities that impact the products in the table below. As fixed
software is made available, this security bulletin will be updated to show
the fixed versions. Until the software fixes are available, HP Networking is
providing the following information including possible workarounds to
mitigate the risks of these vulnerabilities.

  Description

    The most serious issue reported is CVE-2014-0224 and it is the one
discussed here. To take advantage CVE-2014-0224, an attacker must:

    - be in between the OpenSSL client and OpenSSL server.
    - be capable of intercepting and modifying packets between the OpenSSL
client and OpenSSL server in real time.
    - be intercepting/modifying a communication session between OpenSSL
client and OpenSSL server where BOTH are vulnerable.

  Workarounds

    HP Networking equipment is typically deployed inside firewalls and access
to management interfaces and other protocols is more tightly controlled than
in public environments. This deployment and security restrictions help to
reduce the possibility of an attacker being able to intercept both OpenSSL
client and OpenSSL server traffic.

    Following the guidelines in the Hardening Comware-based devices can help
to further reduce man-in-the-middle opportunities:

      <http://h20564.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay/?docId=>
c03536920

    For an HP Networking device acting as an OpenSSL Server, using a patched
OpenSSL client or non-OpenSSL client eliminates the risk. As an example, most
modern web browsers do not use the OpenSSL client and the sessions between
the HP Networking OpenSSL server and the non-OpenSSL client are not at risk
for this attack. For HP Networking Equipment that is using an OpenSSL client,
patching the OpenSSL server will eliminate the risk of this attack.

  Protocol Notes

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
OpenSSL has been updated to fix various security issues:
\*
CVE-2014-3568: The build option no-ssl3 was incomplete.
\*
CVE-2014-3566: Support for TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV was added.
\*
CVE-2014-3508: An information leak in pretty printing functions was
fixed.
\*
CVE-2013-0166: A OCSP bad key DoS attack was fixed.
\*
CVE-2013-0169: An SSL/TLS CBC plaintext recovery attack was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-3470: Anonymous ECDH denial of service was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-0224: A SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability was fixed.
\*
CVE-2014-3570: Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may have produced incorrect
results on some platforms, including x86\_64.
\*
CVE-2014-3572: Don't accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
ciphersuites with the server key exchange message omitted.
\*
CVE-2014-8275: Fixed various certificate fingerprint issues.
\*
CVE-2015-0204: Only allow ephemeral RSA keys in export ciphersuites
\*
CVE-2015-0205: A fix was added to prevent use of DH client
certificates without sending certificate verify message.
\*
CVE-2015-0286: A segmentation fault in ASN1\_TYPE\_cmp was fixed that
could be exploited by attackers when e.g. client authentication is used.
This could be exploited over SSL connections.
\*
CVE-2015-0287: A ASN.1 structure reuse memory corruption was fixed.
This problem can not be exploited over regular SSL connections, only if
specific client programs use specific ASN.1 routines.
\*

# CVE-2014-0224

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0223.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0226.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0224 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224)

#### Description

OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Lifecycle Support - openssl-0.9.7a-43.22.el4
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life - openssl-0.9.8e-12.el5\_6.12

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support - openssl-1.0.0-27.el6\_4.4
* In order to update to the most recent version of the OpenSSL package run the following command:

```
# yum update openssl

```

* Specify the package name in order to update to a particular version of OpenSSL. For example, to update a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 system run:

```
# yum update openssl098e-0.9.8e-18.el6_5.2

```

* The only way to fix it is to install updated OpenSSL packages and restart affected services.
* The safest & simplest thing to do is to perform a system reboot.
* Carry out the following operation if system cannot be reboot.

```
/sbin/ldconfig

```

## Root Cause

* It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify traffic between a client and a server.
* For more information about this Vulnerability, refer to the following article:

  [OpenSSL CCS Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224) Alert](https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433)

## Diagnostic Steps

* To determine if a system is affected by this vulnerability, review the version of OpenSSL:

```
# rpm -qa openssl

```

Additionally, Red Hat Access Labs has released the [CCS Injection Detector](/labs/ccsinjectiontest/) to help validate if your systems have been patched against this vulnerability.

**Note:** This vulnerability cannot be used to extract server or client side key material. This means that existing signed certificates do not need replacement once software is updated.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Note:** Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) is now Nessus Network Monitor. To learn more about this application and its latest capabilities, visit the [Nessus Network Monitor](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-network-monitor) web page.

[Nessus® 5.2.7](/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system) and [Passive Vulnerability Scanner™ 4.0.3](/products/passive-vulnerability-scanner/download) are now available for download.

Today Tenable has released maintenance updates for two separate products, The Nessus vulnerability scanner and the Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS™). Customers are strongly encouraged to apply these updates to all instances as it updates the OpenSSL libraries to patch a vulnerability, and in the case of Nessus addresses a couple of minor bug fixes. Its important to stay up-to-date on all Tenable software to take advantage of all the latest features and improvements. For more information on upgrading Tenable products, please refer to the [Nessus](http://static.tenable.com/documentation/nessus_5.2_installation_guide.pdf) and [PVS](http://static.tenable.com/prod_docs/PVS_4.0_User_Guide.pdf) documentation pages.

The latest release of Nessus (5.2.7) and PVS (4.0.3) includes an update for the following OpenSSL vulnerability:

* OpenSSL libraries have been updated to OpenSSL 1.0.0m, addressing [CVE-2014-0224](/blog/detect-the-latest-openssl-vulnerabilities-using-active-and-passive-scanning)

Nessus 5.2.7 addresses the following two additional issues:

* A race condition occurring when a scan started but then appears as aborted with no results (triggered when a remote scanner was under heavy use)
* Fixes for a potential deadlock between processes

You may download the new releases from the [Tenable Support Portal](https://support.tenable.com/support-center/) or directly from the [Nessus Download page](/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system) or [Passive Vulnerability Scanner Download page](/products/passive-vulnerability-scanner/download).

# Security Bulletin: Rational ClearCase is affected by OpenSSL vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2015-0292)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL that were reported on June 5, 2014 by the OpenSSL Project.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-0224](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224)

**Description:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, caused by the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted handshake to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt and modify traffic.

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Rational ClearCase versions:

| **Version** | **Status** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.3 | Affected |
| 8.0 through 8.0.0.10 | Affected |
| 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x (all versions) 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.13 | Affected |
| 7.0.x | Not affected |

Not all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities.

You are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations:

1. You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.
2. You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server.

   **Note:** Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.
3. You use the Change Management Integrations for base ClearCase with ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert (RTC), or for UCM with ClearQuest or RTC on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest or RTC server.

   **Note:** Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.
4. You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, **and** those scripts use SSL connections.

## Remediation/Fixes

Apply a fix pack for your appropriate release of ClearCase. These fix packs include OpenSSL 1.0.1h.

| **Affected Versions** | **Applying the fix** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.0.1.x | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 4 (8.0.1.4) for 8.0.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037660) |
| 8.0.0.x | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 11 (8.0.0.11) for 8.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037659) |
| 7.1.2.x | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 14 (7.1.2.14) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037658) |
| 7.1.0.x 7.1.1.x | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 14 (7.1.2.14) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037658)  * **Note:** 7.1.2.14 inter-operates with all 7.1.x.x systems, and can be installed in the same way as 7.1.x.x fix packs. |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Disable the ClearCase/ClearQuest integration and any customized defined use of ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl with SSL until you apply the fixes listed above.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1103586#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-06-02 07:17:00 UTC  ``` It was found that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability. An attacker using a carefully crafted handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server.  As per the upstream advisory:  The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client *and* server. OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL. Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1. Users of OpenSSL servers earlier than 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade as a precaution.  OpenSSL 0.9.8 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 0.9.8za. OpenSSL 1.0.0 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.0m. OpenSSL 1.0.1 SSL/TLS users (client and/or server) should upgrade to 1.0.1h.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1103586#c4)  Huzaifa S.

## Security Advisory 0005 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/941-security-advisory-0005?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** 6/9/2014

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | June 9th 2014 | Initial release |
| 1.1 | June 12th 2014 | Addition of patch installation details |
| 1.2 | July 6th 2015 | Updated patch file |

**Open SSL clients running on Arista EOS vulnerable to SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)**

On June 5th, the OpenSSL project issued a security advisory for a vulnerability that could allow a man in the middle attack (MITM) against an encrypted connection. The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client \*and\* server. OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL. Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1.

All current shipping versions of EOS are affected by this vulnerability. Features that use SSL clients and are therefore impacted are XMPP and the "copy" command from the CLI when used in a manner that would involve SSL ( i.e. by using a https:// URL ). Features in EOS not impacted that run SSL Servers are CAPI, VMTracer and WBEM. These features are not impacted because EOS uses Openssl-1.0.0e which is not a vulnerable version.

A software patch (RPM extension) is available for download. In addition currently supported versions of EOS will receive an updated version with the fix for this vulnerability. Currently supported versions of EOS include 4.9 through 4.13.

BugID 90769 addresses this issue.

**Workaround:**
To mitigate this issue customers can:

1. Use SCP as an alternative to “https copy” commands.
2. Ensure servers are running remediated versions of OpenSSL or alternate SSL solutions.

**References:**
For more information about the vulnerability, please visit:
<http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt>

**Verification:**
Verification of the OpenSSL version running in EOS

```

**Resolution:**
The resolution to this issue is through the installation of a patch, or through upgrading to a version of EOS that contains the resolution. This section will be updated once EOS releases are available.

Download URL for patch: [SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix](/arista/www.arista.com/joomla15/assets/data/SecurityAdvisories/SA05SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix)

**￼￼Instructions to install the patch for Security Advisory 0005**

The extension is applicable for all EOS versions 4.9.0 - 4.13.6 inclusive.

Step 1. Copy the file SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix to the extension partition of the Arista switch using any of the supported file transfer protocols:

```
switch#copy scp://This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it./home/arista/SecAdvisory005Patch.swix extension:
```

Step 2. Ensure that the file has been copied to the extensions partition and verify the checksum of the copied file:

```
switch#show extensions
Name Version/Release Status RPMs
------------------------------------ ------------------------- ------ ----
SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix 1.0.0e.Ar/2506963.secAdvi A, NI 1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F:forced
```
```

sha512sum: f7bdda045eb15d72cdb2c7bce709d7ebfef4b796667b41becd441c87511a093388d9eb5fab240c97a6addddc4d1a02a430fb1c8cb88e4a9385408e6cb13cb0bf
```
```
switch#verify /sha512 extension:SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix
verify /sha512 (extension:SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.2.swix) = f7bdda045eb15d72cdb2c7bce709d7ebfef4b796667b41becd441c87511a093388d9eb5fab240c97a6addddc4d1a02a430fb1c8cb88e4a9385408e6cb13cb0bf
```

Step 3. The patch is installed as an extension, and upon installation into a live system will automatically install with the following behavior:

* Cause ProcMgr to reload it's cached dynamic libraries, including the libssl library containing the change (Impact: Non-disruptive)
* Restart the FastClid-server (Impact: Non-disruptive)
* Restart the Xmpp agent if it is running (Impact: Brief disruption to the Xmpp service only)

```
switch#extension SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix
```

**Notes:**

1. All modular switches with dual supervisors require the extension copying and installing on both supervisors.
2. For systems that have not been patched it is possible when installing the extension it may claim a newer version is already installed. It is recommended to install the extension with the “force” keyword at that point.

Once installed, a series of log messages are expected as shown below.
ProcMgr warm restart to reload cached dynamic libraries:

```

```

Restart of FastClid process:

```
Jun 12 12:27:54 sq393 ProcMgr-worker: %PROCMGR-6-PROCESS_STARTED: 'FastClid' starting with PID=24772 (PPID=24771) -- execing '/usr/bin/FastClid'
```

Restart of Xmpp process:

```
Jun 12 16:09:16 sq393 ProcMgr-worker: %PROCMGR-6-PROCESS_STARTED: 'Xmpp' starting with PID=4546 (PPID=4544) -- execing '/usr/bin/Xmpp'
```

Verify that the extension has been installed:

```
switch#show extensions
Name Version/Release Status RPMs
------------------------------------ ------------------------- ------ ----
SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix 1.0.0e.Ar/2506963.secAdvi A,I 1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F:forced
```

Step 4. At this point all existing Cli sessions should be restarted to use the fixed version of openssl when performing "copy" commands.

**Notes:**
RedHat released a tool to detect CCS vulnerabilities here: https://access.redhat.com/labs/ccsinjectiontest/ along with an offline script. On server features that this is tested against ( for example, Capi ) this will falsely report that they are affected on agents that are not running the patched version. This is because the script is looking for the alarm that occurs in patched versions. SSL Servers were never affected due to their running of pre-vulnerability code. If the agent is restarted after installing the extension ( ex. via "agent Capi shutdown" "no agent Capi shutdown" ) the agent will load the new library which will return alarms satisfying the script.

Step 5. Make the extension persist across reboots:

```
switch#copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
switch#show boot-extensions
SecurityAdvisory0005Patch.swix
```

Verification of the OpenSSL version after resolution:

```
switch#sh ver det | grep -i openssl
openssl 1.0.0e.Ar 2506963.secAdvisory0005.6
```

RHSA-2014:0630 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2014-06-05
Updated:
2014-06-05
# RHSA-2014:0630 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 that
fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform includes OpenSSL
0.9.8e, so this flaw is only exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss EAP is used
as a client, communicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version
1.0.1 and above. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433>

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying this update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and
deployed applications (including all applications and configuration files).

## Affected Products

* JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Text-Only Advisories x86\_64

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This page lists the version history of FileZilla Server releases. Have a look at the [changelog](changelog.php) for a detailed list of all changes committed to the source code repository.

### Select history:

[FileZilla Client](versions.php?type=client),
[FileZilla Server](versions.php?type=server)

### 1.9.4 (2024-11-11)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a regression causing the setting 'do not require authentication' to get lost when restarting the server. Note: To see the effect of this fix, administrators must manually reapply the 'do not require authentication' setting for affected users. After this adjustment, the setting will persist as expected.
* MSW: Added NETWORK\_SERVICE as a allowed user for the config dir ownership.

### 1.9.3 (2024-10-17)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed a regression causing the automatic renewal of the Let's Encrypt® certificates to not work properly.
* UI: fixed regression causing the Administration Interface port of the last successful connection to not be properly restored.
* UI: fixed a bug where the TLS key appeared to be lost in the interface if certificate generation failed, even though the key was still retained on the server.

### 1.9.2 (2024-09-30)

#### Bugfixes and minor changes:

* Fixed an issue with the update mechanism

### 1.9.1 (2024-09-09)

* UI: added an FTP connection test, that can be reached directly from the Server menu item or executed at the end of the FTP Network Configuration Wizard.
* Made default values more secure, among which: require TLS on new FTP listeners, require a password for new users and warn if the administration password doesn't meet more stringent security requirements.
* Fixed bug causing the most recent log file, rather than the oldest, to be deleted upon rotation, when using dates as suffixes.
* MSW: fixed regression causing socket listener conflicts due to recent libfilezilla changes.
* Added WebUI: an HTTP server providing a REST API and a web app for seamless web access to stored files. WebUI is not included in the default build and must be enabled with the --enable-webui parameter during compilation. This feature is experimental; feedback and bug reports are welcome.

* Server: The version number in the welcome messsage can now be manually suppressed by setting the "has\_version" attribute of the message field in the configuration file to "false".
* MSW: If the service is running under the SYSTEM account, configuration files are now placed under %PROGRAMDATA%\filezilla-server. This is to workaround the issue that when doing a Windows Update the settings could be wiped out. Settings still residing under %LOCALAPPDATA%\filezilla-server are automatically migrated.

### 1.4.0-rc1 (2022-04-20)

#### Fixed vulnerabilities:

* MSW: the installer doesn't rely on the PATH environment variable to find the tools its needs, but refers to them absolutely, to avoid hijacking.

#### New features:

* The size of the TCP buffer sizes on the sockets used for data transfers can now be specified
* Configuration files are now tagged with a "flavour" and a version number. The Server will refuse to load configuration files with a different flavour than its own or with a version higher than its own. The server's option --config-version-check can be used to control this functionality: if specified, the server checks the versioning, performs the required action and then exit, unless its action is 'ignore'. If the action is 'error', it just checks whether the versions are ok. If the action is 'backup', then a backup of the files is made if the versions are not ok. The parameter --config-version-check-result-file is used to specify a file in which the result of the version check has to be put. If the file contains 'ok', then everything went file. If the file contains 'error', then there was an error. If the file contains 'backup', then a backup was made. The installer makes use of this functionality.
* Admin UI: the selected log entries can now be copied to the clipboard, in CSV, HTML and plaintext formats through the context menu
* Admin UI: the settings dialog layout has been changed to accomodate for future other protocol settings, factoring out the settings that are common to all protocols.
* Admin UI: adjusted borders and spacing to look better on HiDPI displays.
* Admin UI: preserve the fingerprints of the previously connected servers. The connection dialog gives hints when inputing the host and port.

* The UI now automatically attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost
* MSW: users are now case-insensitive
* Mac: created an installer
* Display the administration TLS certificate fingerprints at installation time, so that they can be taken note of.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
