{
  "CVE-2014-0224": {
    "Description": "OpenSSL is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, caused by the use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted handshake to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt and modify traffic.",
    "Root Cause": "The OpenSSL library does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which are used in the SSL/TLS handshake. This allows an attacker to trigger the use of a zero-length master key.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of weak keying material in SSL/TLS clients and servers.",
      "Improper handling of ChangeCipherSpec messages."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to decrypt and modify traffic.",
     "Attack Vectors": [
      "Network traffic interception.",
      "Specially-crafted handshake packets."
    ],
    "Attacker Capabilities": "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between a vulnerable client and server.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "The attack requires both client and server to be vulnerable. OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions. OpenSSL servers are only vulnerable in versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1.",
      "This vulnerability allows for a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker can decrypt and modify traffic.",
       "This vulnerability cannot be used to extract server or client side key material."
    ]
