Subject: Re: CVE-2014-0021: chrony traffic amplification in cmdmon protocol

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> Is this not a same/similar case?

There are many UDP protocols in which the reply traffic is larger than
the request traffic. A vendor can handle this in several possible
ways, including (for example) a statement that the protocol
implementation details were intentional, and that adverse effects are
a network-operations problem, not a software problem. CVE is about
software mistakes. So, at least at the moment, we are looking for
vendors who characterize the issue as a software mistake, and fix it.

In the chronyd case, this seems likely, so we don't expect any
long-term issue with including CVE-2014-0021 in CVE.

There may well be other reasonable approaches. An example approach
might be making CVE assignments for any protocol implementation that's
similar to one that already has a CVE (e.g., similar to ntpd). We're
not currently using that approach.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-17 13:35:09 UTC  ``` Miroslav Lichvar from Red Hat reports that the cmdmon protocol implemented in chrony was found to be vulnerable to DDoS attacks using traffic amplification. By default, commands are allowed only from localhost, but it's possible to configure chronyd to allow commands from any address. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a DoS, which could cause excessive resource usage.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c1)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-17 13:41:26 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c6)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 22:51:09 UTC  ``` This has been discussed upstream:  <http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/chrony.tuxfamily.org/chrony-dev/2014/01/msg00001.html>  Miroslav, is it correct to state that EPEL would be affected by this (chrony 1.25)?  I've not looked at any code, but I suspect this issue has always existed (but is simply not exploitable "out of the box" due to chrony's defaults).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 22:55:37 UTC  ```  Created chrony tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1055003](show_bug.cgi?id=1055003 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0021 chrony: DDoS via amplification in cmdmon protocol [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c8)  Miroslav Lichvar    2014-01-20 13:11:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c6))  Yes, all chrony versions have this problem. EPEL is affected too.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-21 14:12:40 UTC  ``` Noting here details Miroslav posted to the upstream chrony-dev mailing list, including a detailed table with amplification factors of all chrony control commands.  Source:  <http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/chrony.tuxfamily.org/chrony-dev/2014/01/msg00005.html>    I've checked packet lengths for all commands and the biggest offender   is MANUAL_LIST (chronyc manual list), which may amplify the traffic by   up to factor of 17.2. The second worse is CLIENT_ACCESSES_BY_INDEX   (chronyc clients) with factor of 6.5, but the client has to be   authenticated to get the reply. Everything else is below 3. In the   protocol there is at most one reply per request.      The MANUAL_LIST command is used to list up to 32 manual measurements,   which were entered by the SETTIME command when the manual mode is   enabled. It's disabled by default and I think it's unlikely that   someone would use the manual mode on a system connected to internet.      ...      The following table has details on all currently supported commands.   The columns are name, flag if it's open to any client or requires   authentication, minimum length of the request in IPv4 packet, maximum   length of the reply in IPv4 packet and the ratio of the two values.   MD5 authentication is assumed for commands with AUTH.

Is this not a same/similar case?  chronyd, much like ntpd, has some commands that allow for amplification, just like ntpd does.

I'm not going to argue (I didn't assign it, I'm just reporting that it was assigned), but it struck me as being essentially the same type of flaw.  So if ntpd received a CVE for essentially the same thing, I can see why this one was assigned as well.

I'm not sure which part is inconsistent here.  Granted, chrony does not yet have a published fix, but my understanding is that is in the works.  In other words, there will be a fix of some sort (to at least reduce the amplification quite substantially).  Is that the part that seemed inconsistent?  The lack of a published fix?

> With the news about the traffic amplification issue in ntpd, one of
> our developers looked at chronyd

At cve-assign@...re.org, we've received a number of reports that have
protocol descriptions, and ask for CVE assignments for amplification
attacks. We've declined making assignments for those. One of the
criteria we're currently using is:

  - cases in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation announces
    that they made a security-relevant mistake by having configuration
    or code elements that allow amplification attacks, and publishes
    a fix for this mistake

One of the other CVE Numbering Authorities was also receiving similar
reports. We coordinated with them and learned that they were looking
at CVE eligibility in much the same way.

The "in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation" above was
what we had for the CVE-2013-5211 ntpd issue (with some definition of
"announces"). We don't know the ultimate outcome of how amplification
attacks will interact with the scope of CVE, but we did want to point
out that this CVE-2014-0021 assignment seemed inconsistent with what
we've been doing.

Subject: CVE-2014-0021: chrony traffic amplification in cmdmon protocol

With the news about the traffic amplification issue in ntpd, one of our developers looked at chronyd and it suffers from the same flaw.

We've filed a bug [1] and it's also been brought up upstream [2].  There is currently no fix, but as the ntpd issue has been gaining some interest, I'm bringing this up here now for other who may ship chrony.  We assigned it CVE-2014-0021.

[2] <http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/chrony.tuxfamily.org/chrony-dev/2014/01/msg00001.html>

Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-17 13:35:09 UTC  ``` Miroslav Lichvar from Red Hat reports that the cmdmon protocol implemented in chrony was found to be vulnerable to DDoS attacks using traffic amplification. By default, commands are allowed only from localhost, but it's possible to configure chronyd to allow commands from any address. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a DoS, which could cause excessive resource usage.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c1)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-17 13:41:26 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c6)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 22:51:09 UTC  ``` This has been discussed upstream:  <http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/chrony.tuxfamily.org/chrony-dev/2014/01/msg00001.html>  Miroslav, is it correct to state that EPEL would be affected by this (chrony 1.25)?  I've not looked at any code, but I suspect this issue has always existed (but is simply not exploitable "out of the box" due to chrony's defaults).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 22:55:37 UTC  ```  Created chrony tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1055003](show_bug.cgi?id=1055003 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0021 chrony: DDoS via amplification in cmdmon protocol [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c8)  Miroslav Lichvar    2014-01-20 13:11:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c6))  Yes, all chrony versions have this problem. EPEL is affected too.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1054790#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-21 14:12:40 UTC  ``` Noting here details Miroslav posted to the upstream chrony-dev mailing list, including a detailed table with amplification factors of all chrony control commands.  Source:  <http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/chrony.tuxfamily.org/chrony-dev/2014/01/msg00005.html>    I've checked packet lengths for all commands and the biggest offender   is MANUAL_LIST (chronyc manual list), which may amplify the traffic by   up to factor of 17.2. The second worse is CLIENT_ACCESSES_BY_INDEX   (chronyc clients) with factor of 6.5, but the client has to be   authenticated to get the reply. Everything else is below 3. In the   protocol there is at most one reply per request.      The MANUAL_LIST command is used to list up to 32 manual measurements,   which were entered by the SETTIME command when the manual mode is   enabled. It's disabled by default and I think it's unlikely that   someone would use the manual mode on a system connected to internet.      ...      The following table has details on all currently supported commands.

I noticed this as well when reviewing chrony quite a while ago, but I
did not press the issue because its restricted to localhost by default
and the amplification factor is low, especially in packet count terms.
At the time, I did not consider it comparable to the ntpd issue at all,
and I still don't.

Comparable levels of amplification are present in TCP itself and many
other UDP-based protocols.
