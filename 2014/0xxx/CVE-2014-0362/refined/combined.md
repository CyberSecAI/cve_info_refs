## Google Search Appliance dynamic navigation cross-site scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#673313

Original Release Date: 2014-05-01 | Last Revised: 2014-05-01

---

### Overview

Google Search Appliance (GSA) devices contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when dynamic navigation is enabled.

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**  Google Search Appliance versions earlier than 7.2.0.G.114 and 7.0.14.G.216 fail to properly sanitize user input that is reflected directly into a JavaScript <script> block if the [dynamic navigation](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/72/admin_console_help/serve_dynamic_navigation.html) feature is enabled. This allows an attacker to perform a reflected XSS attack. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is resolved in GSA versions 7.2.0.G.114 and 7.0.14.G.216. These updates are available in the [Google Enterprise Support Portal](http://google.com/enterprise/portal). |
| --- |

| **Disable dynamic navigation**This vulnerability can be mitigated by [disabling the dynamic navigation feature](http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/72/admin_console_help/serve_dynamic_navigation.html#enabledn) in the GSA. |
