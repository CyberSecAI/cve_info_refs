- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user input when dynamic navigation is enabled. The input is reflected directly into a JavaScript <script> block without proper encoding or sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the end-user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious script into the dynamic navigation feature of the Google Search Appliance, which is then executed in the browser of users accessing the appliance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input into the Google Search Appliance's dynamic navigation feature, and the user needs to interact with the manipulated appliance.
