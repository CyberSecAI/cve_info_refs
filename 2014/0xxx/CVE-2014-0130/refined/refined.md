  "CVE-2014-0130": {
    "description": "A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary local files accessible to a Ruby on Rails application using the aforementioned routes via a specially crafted request.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the 'implicit render' functionality of Ruby on Rails, specifically how it handles wildcard segments in routes when rendering templates. The application does not perform adequate sanitization on user-supplied input related to the path of the template file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retrieve arbitrary local files from the Ruby on Rails application server by sending a specially crafted request. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive application data, configuration files, or other critical information stored on the server's file system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Ruby on Rails application. The request exploits wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the targeted server. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required for the attack, just the ability to access the application.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered through routes containing wildcards (e.g., `*template_path`). If the application does not define an explicit action to handle the incoming request, the application tries to implicitly render a template using the parameter value. By manipulating the path parameter, the attacker can attempt to access files outside the intended directory. There were initially incorrect assumptions on attack vectors, which were broadened to include more cases. There are no feasible workarounds other than patching the code or explicitly handling the rendering of templates."
