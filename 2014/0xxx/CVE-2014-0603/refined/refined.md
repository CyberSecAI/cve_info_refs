Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an untrusted pointer dereference within the Attachmate Reflection Secure FTP Client. The `GetGlobalSettings` method in `rftpcom.dll` and `GetSiteProperties3` method in `rftpcom15.dll` blindly dereference attacker-supplied memory addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The ActiveX controls directly use attacker-controlled input as memory addresses without proper validation. This can lead to attackers controlling memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser process, potentially gaining control of the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:**  The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content (e.g., a webpage or file) that the victim will interact with.
* **Knowledge of ActiveX Control:** The attacker needs to know the specific ActiveX control and method to target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Attachmate Reflection Secure FTP Client and Attachmate Reflection Pro FTP.
*   Attachmate has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection through Digital Vaccine filters ('13732' and '16446').
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor by "rgod".
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2014-0603, however the advisory on zerodayinitiative.com describes two separate issues with different dll files and methods:
  *  `rftpcom.dll` ActiveX control `GetGlobalSettings`
  *  `rftpcom15.dll` ActiveX control `GetSiteProperties3`
