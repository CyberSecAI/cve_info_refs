Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the OData4j library in Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization, which by default performs external entity resolving when parsing XML documents.
- The `StaxXMLFactoryProvider2` class in OData4j creates XMLInputFactories without disabling external entity resolution, making it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- Additionally, SQL/XML functionality was also vulnerable because its XMLType input factory did not disable external entity resolving by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the application's failure to properly handle external entities within XML documents. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious XML, leading to information disclosure.
- **Default Settings:** The vulnerable libraries, OData4j and the XMLType input factory, are configured to resolve external entities by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A successful XXE attack allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the application server in the context of the user running that server. This means an attacker could access sensitive configuration files, application data, or any other accessible files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack via REST Endpoint:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted XML document containing an external entity to a REST endpoint exposed by the application.
- **Malicious XML Documents:** The attacker injects XML containing external entities that point to files on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to a vulnerable REST endpoint exposed by the application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue arises because `StaxXMLFactoryProvider2` within the OData4j library and the XMLType input factory create XML input factories without disabling external entity resolution or setting a custom XML resolver. This is the default behavior and thus vulnerable.
- The fix involves disabling external entity resolving in the `StaxXMLFactoryProvider2` class and XMLType input factory by setting an XMLResolver.
- RESTEasy applications can disable external entity expansion via the `resteasy.document.expand.entity.references` context-param, but this does not affect the OData4j or SQL/XML vulnerabilities.
- The fix for OData4j involves modifying the `StaxXMLFactoryProvider2` class to disable external entity resolution. A patch for this is available at: <https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12381735/org.odata4j.stax2.staximpl.StaxXMLFactoryProvider2.diff>
- The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 via RHSA-2015:0034.

**Additional Information:**

- Red Hat classifies this as a "Moderate" severity issue.
- The issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.
- The fix for the OData4j component was tracked in JIRA issue [TEIID-2911](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-2911).
- Red Hat Bugzilla also tracks this issue as [Bug 1085555](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1085555).
