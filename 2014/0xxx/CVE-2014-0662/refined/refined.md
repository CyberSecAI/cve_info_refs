Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) module of Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted SDP messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted SDP message to the affected system.
- This can trigger the failure of several critical processes.
- Active calls may be dropped (terminated).
- New calls cannot be established until the affected system is reloaded.
- The system becomes non-functional until a reload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted SDP message to the affected system.
- This can be done via UDP or TCP.
- Deployment using Transport Layer Security (TLS) is also affected.
- The default ports are UDP port 5060, TCP port 5060, and TCP port 5061 for TLS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected system (remote attacker).
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability (unauthenticated attacker).
- The attacker needs to craft and send a malicious SDP message.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence VCS Control, Cisco TelePresence VCS Expressway, and Cisco TelePresence VCS Starter Pack Expressway.
- Both hardware and virtual appliances are affected.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, requiring a software upgrade to fix.
- This vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
- A Base CVSS score of 7.1 and a Temporal score of 5.9 were calculated.
- The vulnerability is resolved in Cisco TelePresence VCS Software X8.1 and later.
