Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory leakage issue within Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leakage:** The primary weakness is a memory leak, which is a programming error where dynamically allocated memory is not released when no longer needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Memory Address Randomization:** The memory leak can be exploited to bypass memory address randomization (ASLR) security measures, making it easier for attackers to predict memory locations for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker.
*   **SWF File:** The attacker would likely need to craft a malicious SWF file, which upon execution in a vulnerable Flash Player environment, would trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SWF file to a user with a vulnerable Flash Player installation. This could be through a malicious website or other means of distributing the SWF file.
*   **Knowledge of Flash Player Internals:** The attacker would require some understanding of how Flash Player handles memory allocation to craft an effective exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that CVE-2014-0557 is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in Adobe Flash Player version 11.2.202.406.
*   The vulnerability is considered "important" and "exploitable" according to the openSUSE and Gentoo security advisories.
*   The impact of the vulnerability is primarily to weaken other security mechanisms like ASLR, rather than directly causing code execution.
