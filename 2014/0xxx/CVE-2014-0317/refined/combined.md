## Vulnerability in Security Account Manager Remote (SAMR) Protocol Could Allow Security Feature Bypass (2934418)

Published: March 11, 2014 | Updated: September 10, 2014

**Version:** 1.2

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if an attacker makes multiple attempts to match passwords to a username.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Windows validates user lockout state. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Update FAQ

**I am running Windows XP Service Pack 3, and I do not have Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) installed. Where is the update for my system?**

If you have Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed and you are not running ADAM, your system is not affected by this vulnerability and you will not be offered the update.

**There are multiple update packages available for Window XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for this software?**

Yes, if you have ADAM installed, you need to install both update 2923392 and update 2933528. If you do not have ADAM installed, you only need to install update 2923392.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of Window XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition software can be applied in any sequence.

**I am running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Why am I not being offered the update?**

The update will only be offered to systems running one of these operating systems if the following is true:

* On Windows Vista, if Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) is installed
* On Windows Server 2008, if Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (AD LDS) is installed
* On Windows Server 2008 R2, if Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is installed
* On Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2, If Active Directory is installed

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click Go to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).
