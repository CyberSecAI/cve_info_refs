Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-0139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how libcurl handles wildcard SSL certificates when they contain literal IP addresses in the Common Name (CN) field. Specifically, libcurl incorrectly validates these certificates against IP addresses, failing to adhere to RFC 2818.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Wildcard Certificate Validation:** libcurl improperly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal IP addresses in the CN field. Instead of rejecting these certificates, it incorrectly performs a wildcard match using the IP address. This deviates from the expected behavior defined by RFC 2818.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. A malicious server using a crafted certificate with a wildcard that matches a literal IP address could intercept and potentially alter encrypted communications.
*   **User Deception:** The incorrect validation could fool users into believing they are communicating with a legitimate site when they are not, due to the acceptance of a maliciously crafted certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through network communication, particularly over SSL/TLS, where a server presents a crafted certificate that libcurl will incorrectly validate when connecting to an IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and present a forged certificate to a client using a vulnerable version of libcurl. They would also need to control a malicious server and configure the server with the crafted SSL certificate.

**Additional Notes:**
* Several sources mention that the vulnerability exists in code copied from cURL.
* Patches for this vulnerability usually involve correcting the certificate validation logic.
* Several vendors patched this vulnerability in their products that include affected versions of libcurl.
