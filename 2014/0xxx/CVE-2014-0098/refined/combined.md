How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  * mod_log_config/mod_ssl: moved the log_handlers registered by mod_ssl
    into mod_log_config itself. These now use the global `ap_ssl_var_lookup()`
    functions and work for all running SSL modules.
    The dependency from mod_ssl to mod_log_config and its header is removed.
    mod_ssl now provides the content of "{errstr}c" as variable "SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY_ERRSTR".
    This change should be fully compatible to all deployed configurations.

core: add r->flushed flag and set it when the response is sent.

By setting EOR->r->flushed in the core output filter, allow one to determine at
log_transaction hook time whether the request has been fully flushed through
the network, or not (network issue, filter error, n-th pipelined resposne...).

Introduce the ap_bucket_eor_request() helper to get the request bound to an EOR
bucket, and uses it in ap_core_output_filter() to mark the EOR's request just
before destroying it, after all the previous buckets have been sent.

While at it, rename the request_rec* member of struct ap_bucket_eor from "data"
to "r", which makes the code clearer (not to be confused with b->data).

Finally, add CustomLog format %F, showing "F" or "-" depending on r->flushed,
for admins to figure out for each request.

```
mod_log_config: instead of using the new dedicated
pattern format "%M" for duration milliseconds,
overload the existing "%D" to choose the time precision
("%{s}D" for seconds, "%{ms}D" for milliseconds and
"%{us}D" for microseconds).

The existing %T and %D without precision are kept for
compatibility.

The previously introduced "%M" ([r1677187](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1677187)) is removed,
it has not yet been released. Format pattern characters
are rare, so we should only use a new one if an
existing one isn't a good fit.

    CustomLog "logs/cond_log" combined "expr=req('User-Agent') == 'x'"

Add ErrorLogFormat directive for configuring the error log format, including
additional information that is logged once per connection or request.

Add error log IDs for connections and request to allow correlating error log

```
Adding sub second timestamps and request end time to mod_log_config.

Add special format tokens to %{...}t. The extended syntax allows the
form: "WHICH:WHAT".

WHICH is either:
- "begin": use the time when the request started
- "end": take "now" as the time
You can omit WHICH, default is "begin".
If you omit WHICH, the separating column is not allowed.

WHAT is either:
- "sec": timestamp in Unix seconds
- "msec": timestamp in Unix milliseconds
- "msec_frac": millisecond fraction of the Unix timestamp,
               3 digits, 0-padded
- "usec": timestamp in Unix microseconds
- "usec_frac": microsecond fraction of the Unix timestamp
               6 digits, 0-padded
- anything different from those tokens: use strftime()
You can omit WHAT, default is the formatted timestamp as
used by the Common Log Format.

The implementation uses a new request_config for mod_log_config
to pass the request end time around between different calls to
log formatters, but the end time is only generated if needed.

* mod_log_config.c: Revert [r109866](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=109866) which used apr_file_writev instead of an
                    apr_file_write w/ a memcpy. Roy Fielding provided a -1 veto
                    on the commit, based on concerns that writev is not
                    guaranteed to be atomic like a write.

fix an old misfeature: "BufferedLogs Off" would sort-of turn
buffered logging on as it set the log writer to the buffered log
writer, though it would leave the are-logs-buffered flag off

this misfeature combined with recent mutex logic for buffered logs
led to a segfault with "BufferedLogs Off"

change the way that thread id is specified in the log format since
the previous implementation used a format string already taken
by mod_logio

now, an optional %P format is used instead

thanks to Andre' Malo for pointing out that I chose a format string
already used by mod_logio!

Forward port: Escape special characters (especially control

client-supplied strings (with special characters) and server-side
strings. This was already introduced in version 1.3.25.

Obtained from: Patch in 1.3.25-dev by Martin

Change conn_rec->keepalive to an enumerated value of

AP_CONN_UNKNOWN
AP_CONN_CLOSE
AP_CONN_KEEPALIVE

This also fixes a problem where ap_discard_request_body would not discard
the body when keepalive was 0.  This actually meant the keepalive status
was unknown *not* closed, but no one ever remembered that.

This problem was seen with mod_dav sending error responses (as reported by
Karl Fogel).

My logger timestamp cache was using an apr_time_t as the cache key.

apr_time_t has a resolution of 1 microsecond.

For some reason, the cache hit rate wasn't very high.  :-)

With this change, the cache key is now the time in seconds, not usec.

  Eliminate potential ap_server_root_relative segfaults, with the input
  of Jeff Trawick's style changes to the first patches.  Doesn't include
  the fixes to ssl [more complex], and we won't trap errors that involve
  ap_serverroot, since we presume that was normalized on the way in.
  Therefore, testing ap_server_root_relative(DEFAULT_FOO) cases
  should never become necessary.

Reduce CPU consumption in conv_10 function, used to format "%d" by apr_*printf

This includes two changes to APR:
  * new functions apr_itoa, apr_ltoa, and apr_off_t_toa
    that provide itoa-type functionality based on pools
  * Inline code in inet_ntop4 to replace sprintf for converting
    binary IP addresses into dotted-decimal format

and two changes to Apache:
  * use the apr_itoa functions in setting the content length,
    in place of apr_psprintf
  * use the apr_itoa functions to replace frequent uses of
    'sprintf("%d",...)' in mod_log_config.

```
Moved util_uri to apr-util/uri/apr_uri, which means adding the apr_
prefix to all of the uri functions (yuck), changing some includes,
and using APR error codes instead of HTTP-specific error codes.

Other notes to test this patch:
- You need to delete the util_uri.h file - exports picks up on this.
- I'd like to remove the apr_uri.h from httpd.h, but that might
  increase the complexity of this patch even further.  Once this patch
  is accepted (in some form), then I can focus on removing apr_uri.h
  from httpd.h entirely.  I need baby steps (heh) right now.
- I imagine that this might break a bunch of stuff in Win32 or other OS
  builds with foreign dependency files.  Any help here is appreciated.

This is a start...  -- justin

Fix seg fault at start-up introduced by Ryan's change to enabl
modules to specify their own logging tags. mod_log_config
registers an optional function, ap_register_log_handler().
ap_register_log_handler() was being called by http_core before
the directive hash table was created. This patch creates the
directive hash table before ap_register_log_handler() is
registered as an optional function.

```
Allow modules to specify their own logging format specifier.  Basically,
mod_log_config has registered an optional function, that other modules
can use to specify a function to be called.  This is analogous to the way
that mod_include works.  This also allows http to do the connection
logging itself, without exposing HTTP specific pieces to other modules.

Rename the module structures so that the exported symbol matches
the file name, and it is easier to automate the installation
process (generating LoadModule directives from the module filenames).

Next step is to remove the 4th argument to the APACHE_MODULE macro
completely and require people to use the matching names, and to
reduce the LoadModule directive to 1 argument.... Objections?

```
Always compute the content-length regardless of whether it is sent to the
client or not.  The reason for this, is that it allows us to log the
bytes sent to the client correctly.  This also simplifies the
content-length filter a bit, by making it a single pass through the
brigade.

```
Clean up a big chunk of ap_config.h.  This basically stops ap_config.h from
including any files.  Because of this change, other files must include
their own headers.  I also cleaned up a couple of other bugs in some
modules because I had to compile them all.

I expect this to break multiple platforms, but this will be fixed over time.
The massive configure cleanup is almost done.  I will go through the files
one more time after this commit.

([colored](/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/loggers/mod_log_config.c?r1=85045&r2=85309&diff_format=h))
```

  This patch corrects the issues from the AP_EXPORT and linkage
  specification arguments to the ap_hooks.h declarations.  As with
  the APR_ and AP_ patches, API_VAR_EXPORT becomes API_EXPORT_VAR,
  and MODULE_VAR_EXPORT becomes MODULE_EXPORT_VAR.

  I will be happy to revert the inclusion of ap_config.h from
  httpd.h if this bothers anyone.  More individual modules need
  to be patched if we do so.

  The API_EXPORTs all moved into central storage in the ap_config.h
  header.  Without WIN32 or API_STATIC compile time declarations,
  these macros remain no-ops.

  This patch also moves the following data from http_main to http_config:

    const char *ap_server_argv0;
    const char *ap_server_root;
    ap_array_header_t *ap_server_pre_read_config;
    ap_array_header_t *ap_server_post_read_config;
    ap_array_header_t *ap_server_config_defines;

  And the following variables had already moved into ap_hooks.c:

    ap_pool_t *g_pHookPool;  (initialized now in http_config)
    int g_bDebugHooks;                   (out of http_config)
    const char *g_szCurrentHookName;     (out of http_config)

  The changes to http_main.c are in preparation for that module to
  move out to a seperate .exe for win32.  Other platforms will be
  unaffected, outside of these changes.

```

Manoj has been pushing for this for a while, but I've been too dense
to understand that he was right.  :-)  Basically, this makes the modules
use ap_config to test for header file inclusion.  This method is not to
be used for larger modules that run autoconf theirselves.  Including
ap_config is only valid for modules which rely on Apache to do their
configuration.  Currently, this is only the core modules.

Remove all of the calls to functions like "ap_popenf".  These functions were
moved down to APR, but they are being removed.  They are not portable, and
were only moved down for backwards compatability.  With this change, they can
be safely removed, which is the next commit on it's way.

```
Start to implement module-defined hooks that are a) fast and b) typesafe.
Replace pre_connection module call with a register_hook call and
implement pre_connection as a hook. The intent is that these hooks will
be extended to allow Apache to be multi-protocol, and also to allow the
calling order to be specified on a per-hook/per-module basis.  [Ben Laurie]

Port a bunch of modules to the new module structure.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## OS X Yosemite v10.10

* **802.1X**

  Impact: An attacker can obtain WiFi credentials

  Description: An attacker could have impersonated a WiFi access point, offered to authenticate with LEAP, broken the MS-CHAPv1 hash, and used the derived credentials to authenticate to the intended access point even if that access point supported stronger authentication methods. This issue was addressed by disabling LEAP by default.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4364 : Pieter Robyns, Bram Bonne, Peter Quax, and Wim Lamotte of Universiteit Hasselt

take advantage of LDAP authorization only [PR 28253]
[Jari Ahonen jah progress.com, Brad Nicholes]
\*) Log the client IP address when an error occurs disabling nagle on a
connection, but log at a severity of debug since this error

sent. Log the client IP address when reporting errors in the core
output filter. [Jeff Trawick]

The module is now called authnz\_ldap and has been moved out of
the modules/experimental area and into modules/aaa with the other
auth modules. Both the authn\_ldap provider and the authz\_ldap

modules. '-t -D DUMP\_MODULES' and '-M' will show all static
and shared modules as loaded from the configuration file.
[Paul Querna]
\*) mod\_autoindex: Add ShowForbidden to IndexOptions to list files
that are not shown because the subrequest returned 401 or 403.

[AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_deflate: Don't deflate responses with zero length
e.g. proxied 304's [Allan Edwards]
\*)  now recognizes the module identifier in addition to the
file name. PR 29003. [Edward Rudd , AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_ssl: Add "SSLHonorCipherOrder" directive to enable the
OpenSSL 0.9.7 flag which uses the server's cipher order rather
than the client's. PR 28665.
[Jim Schneider ]
\*) mod\_ssl: Drop support for the CompatEnvVars argument to
SSLOptions, which was never actually implemented in 2.0.
[Joe Orton]
\*) Fix bug in mod\_deflate that unconditionally sent deflate'd output

format is used. PR 27787. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) Allow Digest providers to return AUTH\_DENIED to propagate a 401
status and terminate the provider chain prior to checking the password.
[Geoffrey Young]
\*) mod\_cgid: Don't allow Scriptsock to be specified inside VirtualHost;
Don't place script socket inside default server root instead of
actual server root. PR 27886. [Jeff Trawick]

"ProxyErrorOverride On" is configured. PR 20183.
[Marcus Janson , Joe Orton]
\*) Threaded MPMs for Unix and Win32: Add support for ThreadStackSize
directive (previously NetWare-only) to override default thread
stack size for threads which handle client connections. Required
for some third-party modules on platforms with small default
thread stack size. [Jeff Trawick]
\*) minor mod\_auth\_basic and mod\_auth\_digest sync. mod\_auth\_basic
now populates r->user with the (possibly unauthenticated) user,
and mod\_auth\_digest returns 500 when a provider returns

[Geoffrey Young]
\*) The whole codebase was relicensed and is now available under

the [handler=...] flag. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Introduce the RewriteCond -x check, which returns
true if the pattern is a file with execution permissions.
[AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Allow proxying and RewriteRules in directory context
for subrequests. PR 14648, 15114. [AndrÃ© Malo]

filesystem name are rejected with 403. [Jeff Trawick]
\*) Switch to APR 1.0 API.
\*) Major overhaul of mod\_include's filter parser. The new parser code
is expected to be more robust and should catch all of the edge cases
that were not handled by the previous one. This includes a binary
incompatible change of mod\_include's external API. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Allow forced mimetypes [T=...] to get expanded.
PR 14223. [AndrÃ© Malo]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Fix LA-U and LA-F lookups in directory context. Previously

PR: 11212 [Joe Orton]
\*) Fix mod\_proxy handling of filtered input bodies. [Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Move the check of the Expect request header field after the hook
for ap\_post\_read\_request, since that is the only opportunity for
modules to handle Expect extensions. [Justin Erenkrantz]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is

**CVE ID:** [**CVE-2014-0963**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0963) **(PI17025)

DESCRIPTION:** IBM HTTP Server is affected by a problem with the handling of certain SSL messages. The TLS implementation can, under very specific conditions, cause CPU utilization to rapidly increase. The situation occurs only in a certain error case that causes a single thread to begin looping. If this happens multiple times, more threads will begin to loop and an increase in CPU utilization will be seen. This increase could ultimately result in CPU exhaustion and unresponsiveness of the IBM HTTP Server and other software running on the affected system.

This issue can affect the availability of the system, but does not impact system confidentiality or integrity. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is moderately complex.

To determine if your systems are being affected by this issue, you can monitor the CPU utilization for IBM HTTP Server instances, or monitor the mod\_mpmstats output written to the ErrorLog.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness with encoded question marks in backreferences ([CVE-2024-38474](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38474))

Substitution encoding issue in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as CGI.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### important: Apache HTTP Server may use exploitable/malicious backend application output to run local handlers via internal redirect ([CVE-2024-38476](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38476))

Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable.

Note: Some legacy uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect a request to a handler must be ported to 'SetHandler' after this fix.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### low: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with initial windows size 0 ([CVE-2023-43622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43622))

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

Acknowledgements: Apache HTTP server would like to thank LI ZHI XIN from NSFoucs for reporting this.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

### low: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request ([CVE-2018-1301](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1301))

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerabilty hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod\_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
