If assistance is needed in determining the appropriate Fix Pack or Interim Fix level, contact IBM Technical Support. It is recommended that you always request the latest available Fix Pack or Interim Fix.

Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, IBM strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Until you apply the fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so IBM strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.
