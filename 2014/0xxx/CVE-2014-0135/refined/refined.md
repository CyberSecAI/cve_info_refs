{
  "CVE-2014-0135": {
    "description": "The kafo_configure puppet module creates /tmp/default_values.yaml world readable and without checking for it's existance. This creates a race-condition that would allow a local attacker to control the contents of the file which stores default values for all parameters (such as auto-generated passwords).",
    "root_cause": "The kafo_configure puppet module creates the `/tmp/default_values.yaml` file with world-readable permissions and does not check for its existence before creation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file creation with world-readable permissions",
      "Race condition vulnerability due to lack of existence check before file creation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit the race condition to control the contents of the `/tmp/default_values.yaml` file, potentially compromising default parameters, including auto-generated passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system is required to exploit the race condition.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker needs to be able to race the creation of the file in `/tmp`. Successful exploitation allows them to write arbitrary content to the file before it's used by kafo."
  },
  "CVE-2014-0192": {
    "description": "since 1e0fd283 it is possible to override spoof by providing a hostname parameters. this would allow to retrieve any template of any host bypassing authentication.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the ability to override the 'spoof' parameter by providing a hostname parameter in the URL, which bypasses authentication checks when retrieving provisioning templates.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authorization checks when retrieving provisioning templates",
      "Exposure of provisioning templates via URL parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retrieve any provisioning template of any host, bypassing authentication. This allows for information disclosure of sensitive data contained in the templates.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/unattended/provision` endpoint, with a crafted `hostname` parameter.",
     "attacker_capabilities":"An attacker needs network access to the Foreman server and the ability to craft HTTP requests."
