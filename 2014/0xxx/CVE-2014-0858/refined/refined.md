- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization allows a non-admin user to modify the URL action and perform a `deleteAction` against the configuration database, instead of the intended `getAction`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization, URL manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-admin user can delete configuration data, potentially leading to service disruption or data loss.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the URL using 3rd party tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-admin user with access to the IBM Content Navigator instance and the ability to modify URL actions using third-party tools.
