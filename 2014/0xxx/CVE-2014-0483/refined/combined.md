How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

These releases address an issue with reverse() generating external
URLs; a denial of service involving file uploads; a potential session
hijacking issue in the remote-user middleware; and a data leak in the
administrative interface. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade
as soon as possible.

#### Issue: reverse() can generate URLs pointing to other hosts (CVE-2014-0480)

Django includes the helper function
django.core.urlresolvers.reverse, typically used to generate a URL
from a reference to a view function or URL pattern name. However, when
presented with input beginning with two forward-slash characters
(//), reverse() could generate scheme-relative URLs to other
hosts, allowing an attacker who is aware of unsafe use of
reverse() (i.e., in a situation where an end user can control the
target of a redirect, to take a common example) to generate links to
sites of their choice, enabling phishing and other attacks.

To remedy this, URL reversing now ensures that no URL starts with two
slashes (//), replacing the second slash with its URL encoded
counterpart (%2F). This approach ensures that semantics stay the
same, while making the URL relative to the domain and not to the
scheme.

Thanks to Florian Apolloner for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: file upload denial of service (CVE-2014-0481)

In the default configuration, when Django's file upload handling
system is presented with a file that would have the same on-disk path
and name as an existing file, it attempts to generate a new unique
filename by appending an underscore and an integer to the end of the
(as stored on disk) filename, incrementing the integer (i.e., \_1,
\_2, etc.) until it has generated a name which does not conflict
with any existing file.

An attacker with knowledge of this can exploit the sequential behavior
of filename generation by uploading many tiny files which all share a
filename; Django will, in processing them, generate ever-increasing
numbers of os.stat() calls as it attempts to generate a unique
filename. As a result, even a relatively small number of such uploads
can significantly degrade performance.

To remedy this, Django's file-upload system will no longer use
sequential integer names to avoid filename conflicts on disk; instead,
a short random alphanumeric string will be appended, removing the
ability to reliably generate many repeatedly-conflicting filenames.

Thanks to David Wilson for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: RemoteUserMiddleware session hijacking (CVE-2014-0482)

Django provides a middleware --
django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware -- and an
authentication backend,
django.contrib.auth.backends.RemoteUserBackend, which use the
REMOTE\_USER header for authentication purposes.

In some circumstances, use of this middleware and backend could result
in one user receiving another user's session, if a change to the
REMOTE\_USER header occurred without corresponding logout/login
actions.

To remedy this, the middleware will now ensure that a change to
REMOTE\_USER without an explicit logout will force a logout and
subsequent login prior to accepting the new REMOTE\_USER.

Thanks to David Greisen for reporting this issue.

#### Issue: data leakage via querystring manipulation in admin (CVE-2014-0483)

Django's administrative interface, django.contrib.admin, offers a
feature whereby related objects can be displayed for selection in a
popup window. The mechanism for this relies on placing values in the
URL and querystring which specify the related model to display and the
field through which the relationship is implemented. This mechanism
does perform permission checks at the level of the model class as a
whole.

This mechanism did not, however, verify that the specified field
actually represents a relationship between models. Thus a user with
access to the admin interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model
structure and the appropriate URLs, could construct popup views
which would display the values of non-relationship fields, including
fields the application developer had not intended to expose in such a
fashion.

To remedy this, the admin interface will now, in addition to its
normal permission checks, verify that the specified field does indeed
represent a relationship, to a model registered with the admin, and
will raise an exception if either condition is not true.

Thanks to Collin Anderson for reporting this issue.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3010-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0480 CVE-2014-0481 CVE-2014-0482 CVE-2014-0483

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0480

    Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL
    reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could
    unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to
    phishing attacks.

CVE-2014-0481

    David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.
    Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may
    degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when
    a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability
    to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,
    eventually causing it to become very slow.

CVE-2014-0482

    David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of
    the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend
    authentication backend could result in one user receiving another
    user's session, if a change to the REMOTE_USER header occurred
    without corresponding logout/login actions.

CVE-2014-0483

    Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's
    data by modifying the "popup" and "to_field" parameters of the query
    string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin
    interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the
    appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display
    the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the
    application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
