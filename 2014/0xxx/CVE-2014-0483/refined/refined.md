Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Django admin interface, specifically the mechanism for displaying related objects in popup windows, did not properly validate the `to_field` parameter in the URL query string. This parameter specifies the field through which the relationship is implemented. However, it was not verified that the field actually represents a relationship between models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The admin interface lacked proper validation of the `to_field` parameter, allowing arbitrary field names to be specified.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass intended access controls and view data from model fields that were not meant to be exposed in popup views.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Attackers could potentially view sensitive data from non-relationship fields, such as password hashes or other private information, by manipulating the query string of admin URLs. This would allow unauthorized access to fields that the application developer intended to keep hidden.
*   **Compromised Data Confidentiality:** Data confidentiality could be compromised if sensitive information is exposed.
*   **Unintended Access to Model Data:** Users with admin access could view the values of non-relationship fields, even those they were not intended to have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Query String Manipulation:** An attacker would manipulate the `to_field` parameter in the URL query string of an admin change form page.
*   **Admin Interface Access:** The attacker would need to have access to the Django admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker must have at least some level of access to the Django admin interface.
*   **Knowledge of Model Structure:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the model structure to construct appropriate URLs and to know which fields to target.
*   **URL Manipulation Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL query string.

**Summary of the Fix:**

The fix implemented in Django involves verifying that the specified `to_field` parameter indeed represents a relationship to a model registered with the admin. If this condition is not met, an exception is raised, thus preventing the data leakage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Django versions 1.4.14, 1.5.9, 1.6.6, and 1.7 release candidate 3.
*   The fix introduces a new exception `DisallowedModelAdminToField` which is raised when an invalid `to_field` is specified.
*   The fix was applied to the `ModelAdmin.changeform_view` method and the `ChangeList` class.
*   The fix also addresses similar issues where an attacker could specify a model field in the to\_field variable of the URL in the admin, revealing fields that were meant to be private, especially when combined with the popup functionality.
