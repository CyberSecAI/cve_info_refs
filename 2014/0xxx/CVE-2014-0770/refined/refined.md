The provided content is related to CVE-2014-0770.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Advantech WebAccess application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. Specifically, by providing an overly long string to the `UserName` parameter, an attacker can overflow the static stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target device remotely.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted, overly long string via the `UserName` parameter to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable application, which is likely accessible over a network. No special privileges or authentication are explicitly mentioned as being required.
