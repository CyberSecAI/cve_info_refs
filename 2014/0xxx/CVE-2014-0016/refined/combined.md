Message-ID: <5316B8F3.60706@redhat.com>

Subject: libssh and stunnel PRNG flaws

Hi All,

Aris Adamantiadis reported the following to us:

I have found a vulnerability in stunnel (fork mode) and libssh server
(if implemented with fork) that is similar to problems found in
postgresql [1]. When accepting a new connection, the server forks and
the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of
openssl doesn't reset its state after the fork, but simply adds the
current process id (getpid) to the PRNG state, which is not guaranteed
to be unique.

stunnel uses libssl, which also seeds the PRNG with the output of
time(NULL), which means that vulnerability has to be exploited under a
second. I have exploit code that can reproduce the issue on OpenBSD 5.4
(thanks to random PIDs) but I think it may be exploitable on other unix
systems as well.

The following CVEs have been assigned:

CVE-2014-0016 stunnel PRNG vulnerability
CVE-2014-0017 libssh PRNG vulnerability

Mitigations implemented into openssl-0.9.8j (2009) makes the
vulnerability not exploitable in stock openssl. The signing code for
ECDSA and DSA explicitly seeds the pool with the digest to sign.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-04 05:24:51 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way stunnel, a socket wrapper which can provide SSL support to ordinary applications, performed (re)initialization of PRNG after fork.  When accepting a new connection, the server forks and the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of openssl doesn't reset its state after the fork, but seeds the PRNG with the output of time(NULL). The most important consequence is that servers using EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates may under certain conditions leak their private key.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-05 06:52:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870826](attachment.cgi?id=870826&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870826&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c3)  Avesh Agarwal    2014-03-05 15:34:38 UTC  ``` stunnel and rhel7 have the same stunnel version 4.56 so would require fixing in rhel7 atleast if stunnel in fedora is fixed. Still looking into other rhel6/5 branches.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c4)  Avesh Agarwal    2014-03-05 16:35:43 UTC  ``` Was going through the code in stunnel 4.56 version and the code uses pthread model and USE_FORK is not used when pthread is detected in rhel and fedora.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c5)  Avesh Agarwal    2014-03-05 16:40:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Avesh Agarwal from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c4)) > Was going through the code in stunnel 4.56 version and the code uses pthread > model and USE_FORK is not used when pthread is detected in rhel and fedora.  The same seems true for stunnel versions in rhel6 and rhel5.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-06 04:54:20 UTC  ``` As mentioned in the previous comments, this flaw does not affect the version of stunnel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, since these versions use POSIX threads (pthreads) and no not use fork().  For the same reason this version does not affect the version of stunnel as shipped with Fedora 19 and Fedora 20.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1072180#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-06 04:55:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue does not affect the version of stunnel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ``` |  |
