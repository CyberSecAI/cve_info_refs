- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an improper implementation of Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in Microsoft Silverlight. This improper implementation allows an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a security feature bypass of DEP and ASLR. This means that the protections offered by these memory protection mechanisms can be circumvented.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By itself, the security feature bypass does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, when combined with another vulnerability such as a remote code execution vulnerability, an attacker can use the DEP/ASLR bypass to execute arbitrary code. The attacker would gain the same user rights as the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can host a website containing specially crafted Silverlight content designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker would then need to convince a user to visit this malicious website, typically by getting the user to click on a link in an email or instant message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious Silverlight content and must be able to convince users to visit the website. Additionally, the attacker would need to chain this exploit with another vulnerability to achieve remote code execution.
