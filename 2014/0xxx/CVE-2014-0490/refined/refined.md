Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-0490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from APT not properly validating signatures when binary packages were downloaded using the `apt-get download` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper signature validation: APT failed to perform adequate checks on the signatures of binary packages downloaded using `apt-get download`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially provide a malicious package that appears to be signed to the user. This can lead to the installation of arbitrary and untrusted code on the affected systems, bypassing package integrity checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manually downloading packages: The vulnerability is triggered when using the `apt-get download` command to obtain binary packages.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious binary package to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the capability to supply a malicious package and convince the victim to download it using `apt-get download`. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue specifically affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
- The vulnerability was resolved by updating the `apt` package.
