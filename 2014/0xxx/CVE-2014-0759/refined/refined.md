Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-0759

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an "unquoted service path" vulnerability in the Schneider Electric Floating License Manager. This occurs when the executable path of a Windows service contains spaces but is not enclosed in quotation marks in the registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unquoted Service Path:** The service path is not enclosed in quotes, allowing for potential malicious execution.
- The vulnerability resides in the Schneider Electric Floating License Manager versions V1.0.0 through V1.4.0

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Program Execution:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to start malicious programs as Windows services by placing a malicious executable in a path that would match the unquoted path.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Since the malicious program runs as a service, this can allow privilege escalation to the level of the account under which the service executes, typically SYSTEM.
- The affected products include: Power Monitoring Expert, Struxureware process Expert (PES), Struxureware process Expert libraries, Vijeo Citect (SCADA), and Vijeo Citect Historian.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** This vulnerability requires local access to the affected system to be exploited.
- **File Placement:** Attackers would need to place a malicious executable in a path that, when expanded, matches the unquoted path of the vulnerable service.
- **Service Start:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable service is started by the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the vulnerable machine
- **Moderate Skill:** According to the ICS advisory, exploiting this vulnerability requires only moderate skill.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place executable files in the file system where they will be executed by the vulnerable service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by enclosing the service paths in quotes within the Windows Registry
- Schneider Electric has released a patch to fix this issue, and recommends that users apply it as soon as possible through their Schneider Electric Software Update system. The patch modifies the registry entry for the service to include quotation marks.
- No known public exploits are specifically targeting this vulnerability.
