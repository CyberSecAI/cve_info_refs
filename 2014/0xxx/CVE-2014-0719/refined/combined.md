| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.8 |

Details  * The Cisco IPS is a family of network security devices that provide   network-based threat prevention services. Cisco IPS Software includes   several applications that are used by the system to run different tasks.   In particular, the *MainApp* process is responsible for multiple   critical tasks, including reading the configuration, starting and   stopping applications, and authentication service, while the Analysis Engine process is responsible for the analysis and inspection of traffic passing through the sensor.      Additional information about the *MainApp* and Analysis Engine processes is in the "System Architecture" section of the product configuration guide:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061>      **Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the **produce-verbose-alert** code of Cisco Intrusion   Prevention System (IPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive.      The   vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented packets by the   Analysis Engine process when the **produce-verbose-alert** action is enabled. An   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets   through the affected system. To trigger the vulnerability, the   attacker could cause a signature with the **produce-verbose-alert** action to   fire, or trigger an event for which **produce-verbose-alert** has been configured as an event action override. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process   to become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting   traffic.      The vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) fragmented packets   passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management   IP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this   vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui91266](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui91266) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0718.         **Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of the control-plane access list   of the Cisco IPS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to cause the *MainApp* process to become unresponsive.      The   vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed TCP packets sent to the   management IP address of the affected system. An attacker could exploit   this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to TCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface.   An exploit could allow the attacker to make the *MainApp* process   unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because   the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks   including alert notification, event store management, and sensor   authentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while   the *MainApp* process is unresponsive. Additionally, due to this general   system failure, other processes such as the Analysis Engine may not work   properly.      The vulnerability can be triggered only by TCP traffic directed to   TCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces   will not trigger this vulnerability. If the Cisco IPS is configured in   promiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require *MainApp* processing such as **shun** or **rate-limit**   may be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the   sensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions   because the Analysis Engine process may not work properly.      This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on hardware and software module for Cisco ASA 5500 Series and Cisco ASA 5500-X Series.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui67394](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui67394) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0719.    **Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability** A vulnerability in Cisco IPS code that handles jumbo frames could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process   to become unresponsive.      The vulnerability is due to improper   handling of jumbo frames sent a high rate. An attacker could exploit   this vulnerability by sending jumbo frames through the sensing interface   of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process   to become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting   traffic.      The vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 based jumbo frames   passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management   IP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this   vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh94944](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh94944) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0720.  Workarounds  * To work around the Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability administrator can disable the **produce-verbose-alert** action.      Use **show configuration** command to determine which signature has the **produce-verbose-alert** option enabled or wheter the **produce-verbose-alert** option is enabled as EAO.      If the **produce-verbose-alert** has been configured at the signature level, the value can be modified by entering the signature configuration prompt and modifying the event action for each signature that needs modification to use **produce-alert** instead of the **produce-verbose-alert** action. The following example shows the procedure to change the event action from **produce-verbose-alert** to **produce-alert** for signature 1475/0:    ```   sensor(config)# service signature-definition sig0sensor(config-sig)# signatures 1475 0 sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine string-tcp sensor(config-sig-sig-str)# event-action produce-alertsensor(config-sig-sig-str)# exitsensor(config-sig-sig)# exitsensor(config-sig)# exitApply Changes?[yes]: yessensor(config)#   ``` Alternatively, an administrator can use the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM) to   connect to the Cisco IPS and navigate to **Configuration > Policies   > Signature Definitions > -Sig-Definition-Name- > Active   Signatures** and filter by using Filter: Action **Produce Verbose Alert** in order to verify any active signatures with the **produce-verbose-alert** option enabled.      For each of the signatures, right-click and choose **Edit Action**. From the panel, uncheck the **Produce Verbose Alert** check box, click the **OK** and apply the changes.      If the **produce-verbose-alert** action is enabled as EAO, this can be disable by modifying the settings for the event action rules policy.      The following example shows how to disable the override with **produce-verbose-alert** configured in the *rules0* event action rules policy:    ```   sensor(config)# service event-action-rules rules0sensor(config-eve)# no overrides produce-verbose-alert sensor(config-eve)# exitApply Changes?[yes]: yessensor(config)#    ```       There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability , however restricting the number of allowed hosts may reduce the exposure of this vulnerability.      To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the **access-list** command. The **no access-list** command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.   The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove   access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the   host with IP address 192.168.1.1:   + Use the **show settings** command in     network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or     networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is     configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings   network-settings   -----------------------------------------------      [...]      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)      -----------------------------------------------         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24         -----------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds       login-banner-text:       [...]   ```    + Use the **access-list** command in network-setting     configuration mode to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts. Note: make sure that if this   is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are   executing the configuration commands to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco   IDSM-2 Module.  ```   sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32   ```    + Use the **no access-list** command in network-setting configuration mode to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24   ```    + Use the **show settings** command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings   network-settings   -----------------------------------------------      [...]      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)      -----------------------------------------------         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32         -----------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds       login-banner-text:       [...]   ```    + Exit and apply the configuration: ```   sensor(config-hos-net)# exitsensor(config-hos)# exitApply Changes:?[yes]:    ```    There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability.         Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the   network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion   document for this Advisory: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32605>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
