- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially-crafted Heartbeat messages or running Heartbleed scanning tools against IBM WebSphere Application Server version 6.1 and 6.0.2. This does not appear to be related to the actual Heartbleed vulnerability itself (CVE-2014-0160), but rather a weakness in how these versions of WebSphere Application Server handle the type of messages used in Heartbleed scans.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of specially crafted heartbeat messages or messages from Heartbleed scanning tools.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially-crafted Heartbeat messages or using Heartbleed scanning tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server instance.
