Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect build environment for the x86 Linux versions of IBM Notes and Domino. The compiler flag "-z execstack" was specified during the build process, causing the executables to have an executable stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Executable Stack:** The primary vulnerability is that the stack, heap, and data sections of IBM Notes and Domino, as well as their child processes, are marked as executable. This is due to the `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality being set.
*   **NX (No-eXecute) Bit Disabled:** The NX bit, which prevents execution of code in data regions like the stack and heap, is disabled due to the executable stack setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Easier Exploitation:** The presence of an executable stack makes it significantly easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in IBM Notes, Domino, and their child processes (e.g. the process using Oracle Outside In library). Attackers can inject and execute malicious code directly on the stack or heap if they find other vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
*   **Code Injection:** Vulnerabilities that might have been difficult to exploit due to the lack of an executable stack can be exploited much more easily.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Exploitation of vulnerabilities present in IBM Notes, Domino, or their child processes using techniques such as buffer overflows.
*   Leveraging the executable stack to run shellcode injected into the stack or heap.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to find an exploitable vulnerability within IBM Notes, Domino, or a child process that they spawn.
*   The attacker would need the ability to inject code into the process's memory (such as the stack or heap).
*   The attacker would need to target the x86 Linux platform as the issue is specific to builds on that architecture.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability note references a CERT/CC blog post called "Feeling Insecure? Blame Your Parent!", which provides additional context on how child processes can inherit the executable stack.
*   The provided text includes methods to check if the stack is executable using tools like `checksec.sh` and `readelf`, and how to disable the executable stack using `execstack`.
*   The issue was addressed in IBM Domino and Notes 9.0.1 Fix Pack 1.
