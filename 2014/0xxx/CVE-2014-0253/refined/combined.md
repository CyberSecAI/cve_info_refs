How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Install .NET Framework for developers

* Article
* 08/30/2022
* 19 contributors

Feedback

## In this article

.NET is an integral part of many apps running on Windows and provides common functionality for those apps to run. For developers, .NET Framework provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building apps that have visually stunning user experiences and seamless and secure communication.

Note

This article is intended for **developers** who either want to install .NET Framework on their own system or who want to install it with their applications. For **users** interested in installing .NET Framework, see the individual articles that discuss installing .NET Framework on specific operating systems, such as [Install .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](on-windows-10).

This article provides links for installing all versions of .NET Framework from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET Framework 4.8.1 on your computer. If you're a developer, you can also use these links to download and redistribute .NET Framework with your apps. For information on deploying a version of .NET Framework with your app, see [.NET Framework deployment guide for developers](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers).

Important

.NET Framework content previously digitally signed using certificates that use the SHA1 algorithm, will be retired in order to support evolving industry standards.

The following versions of .NET Framework will reach end-of-support on *April 26, 2022*: 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1. After this date, security fixes, updates, and technical support for these versions will no longer be provided.

If you're using .NET Framework 4.5.2, 4.6, or 4.6.1, update your deployed runtime to a more recent version, such as **.NET Framework 4.6.2**, before *April 26, 2022* in order to continue to receive updates and technical support.

Updated SHA2 signed installers will be available for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, and 4.6.2 through 4.8. For more information, see the [SHA1 retirement plan](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-retiring-sha-1-content-9750f20d-a9ef-4d43-853f-2075f0a9d7da), the [.NET 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1 lifecycle update blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-april-26-2022/), and the [FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-end-of-support-faq-72b7d8ca-3057-4f0c-8404-67305d40cc04).

Important

All .NET Framework versions since .NET Framework 4 are in-place updates, so only a single 4.x version can be present on a system. In addition, particular versions of .NET Framework are preinstalled on some versions of the Windows operating system. This means that:

* If there's a later 4.x version installed on the machine already, you can't install a previous 4.x version.
* If the OS comes preinstalled with a particular .NET Framework version, you can't install a previous 4.x version on the same machine.
* If you install a later version, you don't have to first uninstall the previous version.

For more information about versions of .NET Framework and how to determine which versions are installed on a computer, see [Versions and Dependencies](../migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) and [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).

Note

For information on .NET Framework 3.5, see [Install the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8](dotnet-35-windows).

Use the following table for quick links, or read further for details. To view the system requirements for .NET Framework before installation, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements). For help with troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

Important

Starting with Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio no longer includes .NET Framework components for .NET Framework 4.0 - 4.5.1 because these versions are no longer supported. Visual Studio 2022 and later versions can't build apps that target .NET Framework 4.0 through .NET Framework 4.5.1. To continue building these apps, you can use Visual Studio 2019 or an earlier version.

You can install the **Developer Pack** for a specific version of the .NET Framework, if one is available, on all supported platforms.

**Developer Packs** only target a specific version of .NET Framework and don't include previous versions. For example, the .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack doesn't include .NET Framework 4.7.

You can install the **Web or Offline installer** on:

* Windows 8.1 and earlier
* Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier

For a full list, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements).

For a general introduction to .NET Framework for both users and developers, see [Getting Started](../get-started/). For information about deploying .NET Framework with your app, see the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers). To read about the architecture and key features of .NET Framework, see the [overview](../get-started/overview).

## Installation choices

Install a developer targeting pack to develop against the most recent version of .NET Framework in Visual Studio or another development environment, or download the .NET Framework redistributable for distribution with your app or control.

### To install the .NET Framework Developer Pack or Targeting Pack

A *targeting pack* lets your app target a specific version of .NET Framework when developing in Visual Studio and some other development environments. A *developer pack* includes a specific version of .NET Framework and its accompanying SDK along with its corresponding targeting pack.

The developer pack for .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2, the targeting pack for .NET Framework 4.6, and the developer pack for .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or 4.8 provides a particular .NET Framework's version of the reference assemblies, language packs, and IntelliSense files for use in an integrated development environment such as Visual Studio. If you're using Visual Studio, the developer pack or targeting pack also adds the installed version of .NET Framework to the target choices when you create a new project. Choose one of the following:

* [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
* [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
* [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
* [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452) to install version 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or earlier, Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2012, or other IDEs.
* [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451) to install version 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2012 or other IDEs.

From the developer pack download page, choose **Download**. Next, choose **Run** or **Save**, and follow the instructions when prompted. You can also install the developer pack or targeting pack for a specific version of .NET Framework by selecting it from the optional components in the **.NET desktop development** workload in the Visual Studio Installer, as the following figure shows.

[![Visual Studio installer with .NET Framework options selected.](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework.png)](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework-large.png#lightbox)

When you target a particular version of .NET Framework, your application is built by using the reference assemblies that are included with that version's developer pack. At run time, assemblies are resolved from the Global Assembly Cache, and the reference assemblies are not used.

When building an application from Visual Studio or using MSBuild from the command line, MSBuild may display error MSB3644, "The reference assemblies for framework "*framework-version*" were not found." To address the error, download the developer pack or the targeting pack for that version of .NET Framework.

### To install or download the .NET Framework redistributable

Installers download .NET Framework components for an app or control that targets those versions of .NET Framework. These components must be installed on each computer where the app or control runs. These installers are redistributable, so you can include them in the setup program for your app.

The download page is provided in several languages, but most of the downloads are provided in English only. For additional language support, you must install a language pack.

Two types of redistributable installers are available:

* **Web installer** (web bootstrapper) downloads the required components and the language pack that matches the operating system of the installation computer from the web. This package is much smaller than the offline installer but requires a consistent Internet connection. You can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install additional language support.
* **Offline installer** (standalone redistributable) contains all the required components for installing .NET Framework but doesn't contain language packs. This download is larger than the web installer. The offline installer doesn't require an internet connection. After you run the offline installer, you can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install language support. Use the offline installer if you can't rely on having a consistent Internet connection.

Both web and offline installers are designed for x86-based and x64-based computers (see [system requirements](../get-started/system-requirements)), but do not support Itanium-based computers.

1. Open the download page for the .NET Framework version you want to install:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. Select the language for the download page. This option does not download the localized resources of .NET Framework; it only affects the text displayed on the download page.
3. Choose **Download**.
4. If prompted, select the download that matches your system architecture, and then choose **Next**.
5. When the download prompt appears, do *one* of the following:

   * If you want to install .NET Framework on your computer, choose **Run**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
   * If you want to download .NET Framework for redistribution, choose **Save**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
6. If you want to download resources for additional languages, follow the instructions in the next section to install one or more language packs.

Note

If you encounter any problems during the installation, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

**Installation notes:**

* .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions replace .NET Framework 4.0. When you install these versions on a system that has .NET Framework 4 installed, the assemblies are replaced.
* Uninstalling .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions also removes pre-existing .NET Framework 4 files. If you want to go back to .NET Framework 4, you must reinstall it and any updates to it. See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5a4x27ek%28v%3Dvs.100%29).
* You must have administrative credentials to install .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions.
* The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2012/2749655).

## To install language packs

Language packs are executable files that contain the localized resources (such as translated error messages and UI text) for supported languages. If you don't install a language pack, .NET Framework error messages and other text are displayed in English. Note that the web installer automatically installs the language pack that matches your operating system, but you can download additional language packs to your computer. The offline installers don't include any language packs.

Important

The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app, so you must run the web or offline installer before you install a language pack. If you have already installed a language pack, uninstall it, install the .NET Framework, and then reinstall the language pack.

1. Open the language pack download page for the .NET Framework version you've installed:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. In the language list, choose the language you want to download, and wait a few seconds for the page to reload in that language.
3. Choose **Download**.

The following table lists the supported languages.

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2916607)

Published: February 11, 2014 | Updated: September 24, 2014

**Version:** 1.3

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits a specially crafted website or a website containing specially crafted web content. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the compromised website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3, Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 on affected editions of Microsoft Windows.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework by correcting how it terminates stale or closed HTTP requests that are started by clients, by improving how it deems a method safe for execution, and by ensuring that it properly implements Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912).

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

## POST Request DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0253

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Microsoft ASP.NET that could allow an attacker to cause an ASP.NET server to become unresponsive.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0253).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on any supported edition of Microsoft Windows. To be affected by the vulnerability, customers must manually install and enable ASP.NET by registering it with IIS.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configure the <serverRuntime>, <requestLimits>, and <httpRuntime> elements so that requests that attempt to exploit the vulnerability are rejected**

  To block requests that attempt to exploit the vulnerability, in the ASP.NET configuration file for the application configure the following:

  1. Set the **httpRuntime/maxRequestLength** attribute to a specific value that is appropriate for your application. The default value is 4096 KB.
     For more information on this attribute, see [httpRuntime Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641%28v%3Dvs.100%29.aspx).
  2. Set the **requestLimits/maxAllowedContentLength** attribute to a value equal to the maxRequestLength configured in step 1. Note that this value is specified in bytes rather than kilobytes.
     For more information on this attribute, see [Request Limits <requestLimits>](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering/requestlimits).
  3. Set the **serverRuntime/uploadReadAheadSize** attribute to a value equal to the maxRequestLength configured in step 1. Note that this value is specified in bytes rather than kilobytes.
     For more information on this attribute, see [Server Runtime <serverRuntime>](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/serverruntime).

     **Note** The developer should set the above attributes to a value appropriate for the application. The example below shows setting the value to 32 KB.

     ```
             <system.web>
               <httpruntime maxrequestlength="32">
            </httpruntime></system.web>
            <system.webserver>
               <security>
                  <requestfiltering>
                     <requestlimits maxallowedcontentlength="32768">
                  </requestlimits></requestfiltering>
               </security>
               <serverruntime enabled="true">
            </serverruntime></system.webserver>

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** These limits are set by the developer and could have negative performance implications.

## VSAVB7RT ASLR Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0295

A security feature bypass exists in a .NET Framework component that does not properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature, after which the attacker could load additional malicious code in the process in an attempt to exploit another vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0295](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0295).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Install the Force ASLR feature hotfix and enable the IFEO registry entry**

  The Force ASLR feature, which is an addition to the ASLR feature for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, makes it possible for applications to forcibly relocated images that are not built with the /DYNAMICBASE linker flag. Once installed, computer administrators and software developers can enable the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) in the registry to force ASLR behavior for non-ASLR images.

  For more information and installation instructions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308).

  **Impact of workaround.** Forcibly relocates images that are not built with support for ASLR, which can cause application compatibility problems.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308) for information on setting the IFEO registry entry to the default setting.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a security feature bypass vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because specific .NET Framework components were not built to implement the ASLR security feature. As a result, an attacker can more reliably predict memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.

**What is ASLR?**

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) moves executable images into random locations when a system boots, which helps prevent an attacker from leveraging data at predictable locations. For a component to support ASLR, all components that it loads must also support ASLR. For example, if A.exe consumes B.dll and C.dll, all three must support ASLR. By default, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 will randomize system DLLs and EXEs, but DLLs and EXEs created by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) must opt in to support ASLR using the /DYNAMICBASE linker option.

ASLR also randomizes heap and stack memory:

* When an application creates a heap in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2, the heap manager will create that heap at a random location to help reduce the chance that an attempt to exploit a heap-based buffer overrun succeeds. Heap randomization is enabled by default for all applications running on Windows Vista and later.
* When a thread starts in a process linked with /DYNAMICBASE, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 move the thread's stack to a random location to help reduce the chance that a stack-based buffer overrun exploit will succeed.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In a web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the ASLR security feature, which protects users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

When a user visits a website that contains malicious content using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components, such as Internet Explorer, the affected .NET Framework component can be loaded to bypass ASLR.

An attacker could tie this security feature bypass vulnerability to an additional vulnerability, usually a remote code execution vulnerability. The additional vulnerability would take advantage of the security feature bypass for exploitation. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

In the web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**
Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that the .NET Framework component properly implements ASLR.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-0295](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0295).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
