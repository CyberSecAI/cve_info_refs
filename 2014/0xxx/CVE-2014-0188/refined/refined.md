Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0188:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `openshift-origin-broker` handles authentication requests when using the remote user authentication plugin. The plugin trusts the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable, which is intended to be set after authentication. However, the system allows the `X-Remote-User` header to be passed through to set the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable when combined with certain passthrough triggers. This allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authentication Handling:** The `remote-user` authentication plugin trusts the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable without proper validation that it was set through a legitimate authentication process.
*   **Header Injection:** The system allows the `X-Remote-User` header to set the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable.
*   **Passthrough Provisions:** Certain passthrough triggers allow requests with the `X-Remote-User` header to bypass authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Impersonation:** A remote attacker can impersonate any OpenShift user account on the system without authenticating.
*   **Complete System Access:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows complete access to any user account, potentially leading to full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes the `X-Remote-User` header.
*   **Passthrough Trigger:** The attacker sends the malicious HTTP request to a passthrough trigger, such as the management console or a similar path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `openshift-origin-broker` service.
*   **Knowledge of Passthrough Triggers:** The attacker needs to know a valid path that will act as a passthrough trigger.

**Additional Details:**
*   A simple workaround is to unset the `X-Remote-User` header in the host's HTTP configuration using `RequestHeader unset X-Remote-User`.
*   Red Hat released security advisories RHSA-2014:0422 and RHSA-2014:0423 to address this issue for different versions of OpenShift Enterprise.
* The vulnerability has a "Critical" severity rating.
