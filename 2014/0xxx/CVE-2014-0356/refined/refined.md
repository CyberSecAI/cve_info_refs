Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-0356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command. Specifically, command injection vulnerabilities are present in several functions due to insufficient input sanitization before executing system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection vulnerability (CWE-78) is present in the following functions:
    - `detectWeather()`
    - `set_language()`
    - `SystemCommand()`
    - `NTPSyncWithHost()`
- Command Injection vulnerability is also present in the following `udps` commands:
    - `SET COUNTRY`
    - `SET WLAN SSID`
    - `SET WLAN CHANNEL`
    - `SET WLAN STATUS`
    - `SET WLAN COUNTRY`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote unauthenticated attacker on the local area network may be able to inject arbitrary commands or run arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerable functions `detectWeather()`, `set_language()`, `SystemCommand()`, and `NTPSyncWithHost()` are likely reachable via the web interface of the router.
- The vulnerable `udps` commands are accessible from the LAN side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the local area network (LAN) to exploit the `udps` command injection vulnerabilities.
- An attacker on the LAN could likely exploit the other vulnerable functions via the web interface, depending on how these are exposed and how they handle requests. The document states "A remote unauthenticated attacker on the local area network..." which implies that no authentication is necessary to trigger these issues.
