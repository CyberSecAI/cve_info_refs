- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application authenticity feature in IBM Worklight and IBM Mobile Foundation can be bypassed due to insufficient validation of the client application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the application authenticity verification mechanism, where the Worklight server validates the client application for tampering. Under certain conditions, this validation can be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a third party to bypass the application authenticity validation and modify the client application. This could lead to malicious modifications or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting weaknesses in the client application's authenticity verification process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to identify and exploit the bypass conditions in the application authenticity validation. They also need to be able to modify the client application.

The content also includes mitigation information noting that debug mode enabled on Android applications can increase the risk of exploitation.
