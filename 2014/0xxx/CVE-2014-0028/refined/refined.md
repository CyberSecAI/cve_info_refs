```
{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-0028",
  "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the use of `virConnectDomainEventRegister()` and `virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny()` could be used to learn about `virDomainPtr` objects that should have been inaccessible to the user, bypassing the `domain:getattr` ACL filtering.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "ACL Bypass",
    "Information Disclosure"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker could obtain information about domains that they should not have access to, potentially learning about the existence of those domains and their identifiers. If no other ACLs are in place, the attacker could also perform other unauthorized actions on those domains, such as starting or stopping them.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "Abuse of the libvirt API functions `virConnectDomainEventRegister()` and `virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny()`"
  ],
  "requiredCapabilities": [
    "Ability to register for domain events via the libvirt API.",
    "User with limited access privileges but able to connect to libvirt."
  ],
   "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is partially mitigated by the fact that any domain that does not trigger an event in the timeframe where the attacker maintains their event callback will not be leaked."
