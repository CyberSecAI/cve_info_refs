-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
CVE-2014-0109: HTML content posted to SOAP endpoint could cause OOM errors
Severity: Major
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.6.14
and 2.7.11.
Description:
If content is posted to a SOAP endpoint with Content-Type text/html, CXF
creates an error message based on the input. This could potentially cause a
Out Of Memory (OOM) error on a large input, leading to a possible Denial of
Service attack.
This has been fixed in revisions:
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cxf.git;a=commit;h=f8ed98e684c1a67a77ae8726db05a04a4978a445
Migration:
CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.14 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.11 or later as soon as possible.
References: http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html

We would like to thank Giancarlo Pellegrino and Davide Balzarotti for

# RHSA-2014:1351 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.1.0 Rollup Patch 1, which addresses several
security issues, multiple bug fixes, and adds various enhancements, is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
6.1.0. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the
readme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security
issues are addressed in this release:

It was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying
a user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end
that allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of
Apache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as
valid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain
access to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.
(CVE-2014-0034)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error
messages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted request which, when processed by an application using
Apache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,
possibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)

It was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache
CXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed
by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk
space, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)

It was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web
page that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.
(CVE-2014-0168)

It was found that the Spring Framework did not, by default, disable the
resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration when processing
user-provided XML documents. By observing differences in response times, an
attacker could identify valid IP addresses on the internal network with
functioning web servers. (CVE-2014-0225)

It was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache
CXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name
and password used by the client application using Apache CXF.
(CVE-2014-0035)

A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-0193)

Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
installation instructions.

Red Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the
CVE-2014-0193 issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
security update.
