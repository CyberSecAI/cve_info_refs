{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-0109",
    "description": "If content is posted to a SOAP endpoint with Content-Type text/html, CXF creates an error message based on the input. This could potentially cause an Out Of Memory (OOM) error on a large input, leading to a possible Denial of Service attack.",
    "affected_versions": "Apache CXF prior to 2.6.14 and 2.7.11",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Apache CXF handles error messages when processing a request with 'Content-Type: text/html' at a SOAP endpoint. It creates an error message that includes the full input data, which is not bounded. This lack of input size control leads to excessive memory consumption when a large amount of HTML content is sent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted request with a large amount of HTML content to a SOAP endpoint. This can lead to an Out of Memory (OOM) error, crashing the application or rendering it unusable.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted POST request with a large amount of HTML content to a SOAP endpoint.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to a vulnerable SOAP endpoint. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
