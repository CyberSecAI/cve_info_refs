This blueprint looks to ensure: \* we check glance says its OVF or OVA before attempting to extract the image \* if there is no container\_format or it is BARE, then we try to download the VHD directly For the implementation, we will use... | |
| **[Move Live Migrations To Conductor](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bspec/live-migration-to-conductor "live-migration-to-conductor")** for **OpenStack Compute (nova)**  Live migrations should be unified with the new conductor-resident unified code path(s) for migration. | |

### Bug Description

It seems that when using the EC2 API, the security group implementation does not enforce RBAC policy for the add\_rules, remove\_rules, destroy and other functions (in compute/api.py). Only the add\_to\_instance and remove\_from\_instance functions enforce RBAC. This seems like an oversight for obvious reasons.

The Nova API security group implementation does enforce RBAC on these functions.

In addition, the add\_to\_instance and remove\_from \_instance functions which are wrapped in RBAC verification use the "compute:security\_groups" action which is not even listed in the default /etc/nova/policy.json. The latter is confusing to users.

This is the case on Grizlly and at first glance, it doesn't look like this has changed in Havana.

I've marked the OpenStack Security Advisory task for this bug incomplete because the vulnerability management team is waiting for Nova core security reviewers to triage/confirm/reproduce the issue and determine a probable fix. Once we get closer to having a good grasp of the details there, the OSSA task will begin to separately progress through impact description drafting and review, CVE request and assignment, downstream notification and finally public disclosure (hopefully) synchronized with publication of the finalized patches. Hopefully that answers your questions.

I've confirmed the behaviour, and it seems that it's likely been this way for a while.

The trend in the OpenStack API has been to move policy out of the compute api and into the API itself. Even the existing checks on add\_to\_instance/remove\_from\_instance are likely to go away at some point. So to keep in line with that the fix for this would be to add policy checks into the ec2 API.

The code for policy enforcement is non invasive and easily backportable but we'll want to set a default policy that won't cause a problem for deployments. As mentioned by Marc, the current "compute:security\_groups" rule isn't listed which means it uses the default rule. The default for the default rule is to limit calls to admins or users who share a project\_id with the security group. If we set up new policies for the security group calls that use the default rule it may break a use case that relies on the unrestricted behaviour currently available, but I believe that's ok. And using the default rule will put the new policies in line with the existing policies for security groups calls.

Trying to make sure this is an exploitable vulnerability...

if add\_to\_instance and remove\_from\_instance are protected by RBAC, can you actually do any harm using the unprotected functions ? What would be the attack scenario ? Would for example using remove\_rules remove securitygroup rules from instances ?

Assuming the default case of deny all in a security group, the attack scenario would be to use add\_rules to add rules to an instance.

Now, the problem with this bug is that users may get into a situation where there is a false sense of security.

For example, as a private-cloud operator, I want to restrict all Nova actions to users with the "Member" role on the tenant. Once that is done, I want to create a new role that allows only for read-only access to security group and instance information for auditing purposes. I can achieve this by editing the rule for the "compute\_extension:security\_groups" action in /etc/nova/policy.json. This will do what I want for the Nova API. The problem is that the EC2 API is left vulnerable and a user that does not have the Member role but only the read-only role can now add or delete rules from a security group.

I hope that helps to clarify things. Of course, this bug only affects users who are trying to create tighter access controls. The default configuration is not affected by this bug since it grants any role on a project/tenant full access.

A couple questions while I try to draft an impact description for the CVE:

\* Mark, should we credit the company you work for, in addition to your name ? If yes, which company is it ?

\* Any idea which versions of OpenStack should be considered vulnerable to this ? I suspect that would be when RBAC was added to openStack API, but not sure how to be more precise than that

For the versions, it sounds like this might go back pretty far. I can confirm that it affects Grizzly.

Re: the patch - Although I agree it fixes the problem I'm not sure its the way we should do it.

We already have a policy "compute\_extension:security\_groups" which is used by the Nova API to enforce

access in a general way to all of these features. So I'm thinking that rather than introducing new policies

more specific such as compute:security\_groups:remove\_rules settings to fix the bug we should just use

the existing generic compute\_extension:security\_groups rule in the ec2 API.

Now I think there may be a reasonable argument for having per method type policy settings in the API

rather than general ones and we have generally been moving this way anyway, but if we do so we need to

be consistent across the Nova and EC2 APIs. So if a compute:security\_groups:remove\_rules policy is used

by the EC2 code it should also be checked by the Nova API code too. Otherwise deployers could be mislead into

thinking the policy is affecting the Nova API when it isn't.

I think unless there is a clear need now to have detailed policy checks I think for an immediate bug fix we

should just use the existing general security groups policy (which I think also means no policy file changes

are needed by deployers just the code update). And then if we want to have more fine grained policy checks

we can do this in Juno. And this needs to be done fairly carefully for the Nova API side to ensure minimal

upgrade impact.

And more generally we definitely need to ensure all possibly policy checks are in the policy file rather than

rely on defaults as deployers should not be expected to grep the code to see what switches are available :-) I will

submit a blueprint for that work in Juno.

Yeah, I am -1 for what chris said.

Seems like we should use the same policy as the core openstack API, otherwise people will have to configure new policy for an api they may not release that had turned on, or something like that.

I agree that we should have a more granular policy on both in the long term, but thats not really the fix for this bug, as I see it.

I was hesitant to say anything about the patch, but Christopher is right, keeping the previously hidden "compute:security\_groups" policy doesn't make sense if people are already using "compute\_extension:security\_groups". We should just have one way to do this.

And yeah, as an operator, having more fine grained policy is a plus, but this could be done in a future release.

Christopher: Works for me. I'm happy with a simpler solution for now if everyone agrees. I'll update shortly.

And Tristan, I'll work on a backport but I just wanted to get approval on the direction first.

I added the fine grained controls into the ec2 api because the OpenStack api has fine grained controls as well, they're just enforced at the compute api level. Actually I see now that I should have just added the @wrap\_check\_security\_groups\_policy decorator for the compute api methods that the ec2 api uses. But really the ec2 api and OpenStack api have different semantics, and make different calls, so I think it's fine for them to have different policies. That can be handled later in a non security review though.

Subject: [OSSA 2014-011] RBAC policy not properly enforced in Nova EC2 API
 (CVE-2014-0167)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-011
CVE: CVE-2014-0167
Date: April 09, 2014
Title: RBAC policy not properly enforced in Nova EC2 API
Reporter: Marc Heckmann (Ubisoft)
Products: Nova
Versions: from 2013.1 to 2013.2.3

Description:
Marc Heckmann from Ubisoft reported a vulnerability in the Nova EC2 API
security group implementation. RBAC policies are not enforced when using
the EC2 API, in particular the add_rules, remove_rules and destroy
methods. A restricted user may overcome his limitation by using EC2 API
resulting in unauthorized action on security groups. Only setups using
non-default RBAC rules for Nova may be affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86358>

Icehouse (milestone-proposed branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86360>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/86361>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-rc2 development milestone and
in a future 2013.2.4 release.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [nova](/security/cves?package=nova) - OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

## Details

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Nova

did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was

found in OpenStack Nova, this vulnerability could be used to escalate

privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-1068](/security/CVE-2013-1068))

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did

not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via

disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-4463](/security/CVE-2013-4463), [CVE-2013-4469](/security/CVE-2013-4469))

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce

SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid\_protocol is

set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu

does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6491](/security/CVE-2013-6491))

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create

expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated

attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via

ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-7130](/security/CVE-2013-7130))

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image

format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could

exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers

would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0134](/security/CVE-2014-0134))

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy

when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated

user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0167](/security/CVE-2014-0167))
