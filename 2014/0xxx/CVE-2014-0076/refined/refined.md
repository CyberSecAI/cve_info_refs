Based on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-0076:

**CVE-2014-0076: ECDSA Nonces Recovery Weakness**

*   **Root Cause:** The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL did not ensure constant-time behavior for certain swap operations. This allowed attackers to recover ECDSA nonces.
*   **Vulnerability:** Implementation error within the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
*   **Attack Vector:** FLUSH+RELOAD cache side-channel attack. This requires the attacker to be able to run an application on the affected device (local access).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (ECDSA nonces) can be disclosed. Recovery of the secret key of the signer.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Allows unlimited forgeries.
    *   Potential man-in-the-middle attack, allowing the attacker to view or modify the secured traffic.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local user or remote attacker.
    *   Ability to run an application on the affected device.
    *   Ability to perform cache side-channel attacks.
    *   Ability to intercept and alter network traffic in real time.

The information from various sources indicate the following:

*   **Vulnerable Software:** OpenSSL versions up to 1.0.0l and 1.0.1g (but before patched versions). Specific products and versions are listed in the extracted content.
*   **Mitigation:** Applying patched versions of OpenSSL (e.g., OpenSSL 0.9.8za, 1.0.0m, 1.0.1h, or later).  Some vendors suggest revoking and re-issuing SSL certificates, and resetting user credentials after applying the patch.
*   **Severity:** Rated as "low" to "moderate" severity, depending on the source and affected product.
*   **Affected Systems:** This vulnerability can impact both clients and servers.
*   **Workarounds:** Some vendors suggest disabling SSL at the bridge or disabling TLS if possible in the configuration files, but this is not a comprehensive solution.

The information also notes that while the vulnerability exists, exploitation may be difficult, often requiring specific conditions and, in some cases, local access.
