{
  "CVE-2014-0082": {
    "description": "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the text rendering component of Action View. Strings sent in specially crafted headers will be converted to symbols. This can cause a denial of service since symbols are not removed by the garbage collector.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "3.0.x",
      "3.1.x",
      "3.2.x"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "3.2.17"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of strings in headers, which are converted into symbols. Symbols in Ruby are not garbage collected, thus leading to memory exhaustion.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted queries that create Ruby symbols which are not garbage collected, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.",
     "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted headers with a large number of unique strings.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and craft headers with unique string values. No authentication or special privileges are required.",
    "workarounds": [
      "A monkey patch can be applied to prevent the conversion of header values into symbols."
    ],
    "patch_instructions": "Apply the provided patches to the affected versions, or upgrade to version 3.2.17 or later.",
        "additional_notes": [
        "Upstream acknowledges Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the original reporter.",
                "Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2 is not planned to be addressed in future updates and is rated as having a Moderate security impact",
        "This issue was fixed in rubygem-actionpack 3.2.17 upstream.",
        "Multiple patches for different versions were created by Kurt Seifried and are available"
            ]
