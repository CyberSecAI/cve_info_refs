{
  "CVE-2014-0143": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflows due to weak input validation or logic errors in QEMU block drivers (CLOOP, QCOW2 v2 and Bochs image formats)",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Missing input validation",
      "Logic Error",
      "Buffer Overflow"
     ],
    "Impact": "An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Attack vectors": "By modifying a disk image file loaded by a guest.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify a disk image file that will be loaded by a QEMU guest"
