4.  CVE-2014-0193
    - **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation did not correctly handle a stream of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames, lacking an upper limit on aggregation size.
    - **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trigger an Out Of Memory Exception, potentially leading to denial of service on the server.
    - **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends a series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames via a websocket connection.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted websocket request to the server.
