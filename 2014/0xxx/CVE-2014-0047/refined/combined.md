| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1063549#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-11 01:24:50 UTC  ``` Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team reports:  A number of unsafe uses of /tmp, ranging from actual code to test code and documentation exmaples. In general many are due to unsafe use in bash scripts,  and can be fixed by using mktemp() correctly. There is also at least one Ruby  one (the Vagrant file) and several go scripts that use bash command lines  unsafely.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1063549#c2)  Trevor Jay    2015-03-24 05:19:04 UTC  ``` Under 1.5, I deleted /tmp, started the docker service, pulled an image, and started a container with no mishaps or creation of /tmp.   ``` |  |

It would seem so, yes.

For the 'tmp' issue, we were contacted at Docker about tmp directory usage
during building or running of tests for Docker itself. It is not clear if
CVE-2014-0047 is a reflection of this, but it appears so. In that specific
case, we performed triage and determined that either no such abuses of tmp
existed at the time, or that those uses of tmp were run within containers
in such a way that no vulnerability existed.

duplicate of CVE-2014-5277 (HTTP downgrade attack against registry).

Both of these reports precede the establishment of a focused security team
and process at Docker.

Eric Windisch
