Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-0047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsafe use of `/tmp` directory in various parts of the Docker codebase, including actual code, test code, and documentation examples. These unsafe uses stemmed from:
    - Incorrect usage of bash scripts, especially with regards to temporary file creation
    - Unsafe use of bash command lines within Ruby (Vagrant file) and Go scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file creation leading to potential race conditions and unauthorized access or modification of temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The specific impact is not described in detail beyond the general risks associated with insecure temporary file creation. Potential impacts include:
    - Unauthorized file access, modification, or deletion
    - Denial of service through resource exhaustion
    - Privilege escalation in some scenarios

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the insecure creation and usage of temporary files in the `/tmp` directory by Docker and its related scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or access the execution environment where the vulnerable Docker components are running.
- The attacker would need to exploit the race conditions or insecure file handling involved in temporary file creation and management.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found in both code and testing, indicating systemic issues with temporary file handling within the docker project.
- The reported issue was primarily found in bash scripts but also in Ruby and Go scripts using bash.
- The vulnerability was reported to be fixed by using `mktemp()` correctly which suggests a lack of proper use of this function or similar safe mechanisms for temp file creation as the root issue
- The provided text suggests that the reported instances were either found to be not exploitable, or were mitigated by being run inside containers, limiting external exposure.
- The issues were fixed in Docker version 1.5 and possibly earlier versions.
