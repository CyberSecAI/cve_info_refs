## Description

[![@martinpovolny](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51095?u=cd9b1c9abf5722192dbb3368a28d780b335cd649&v=4&size=48)](/martinpovolny)[martinpovolny](https://github.com/martinpovolny)opened [on Feb 5, 2015](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/issues/1581#issue-56641113)

The current code in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` that does RBAC checking is:

```
  def check_generic_rbac
    ident = "#{controller_name}_#{action_name}"
    if MiqProductFeature.feature_exists?(ident)
      role_allows(:feature => ident, :any => true)
    else
      valid_route?(request.request_method, controller_name, action_name)
    end
  end

```

Meaning that if we do not find particular RBAC feature, we just validate the existence of a route and let the request in.

The routes are whitelisted in the route file and effort was put into making sure that we have all the features defined.

Right now I don't see an exploit for this as there would have to be extra route for this to an action what does not have RBAC feature and check defined.

However for a developer it's easy to forget and expose something this way.

Therefor we shoud we should change the code to:

```
  def check_generic_rbac
    ident = "#{controller_name}_#{action_name}"
    if MiqProductFeature.feature_exists?(ident)
      role_allows(:feature => ident, :any => true)
    else
      false
    end
  end

```

and fix or change whatever is needed to be done to make everything work as before from the user perspective.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1067623#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-20 18:36:13 UTC  ``` Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team reports:  CFME contains an authorization bypass issue in the action rbac_user_edit, which allows authenticated users with minimal privileges to gain access to  additional privileges.  The problem is in the method check_privileges in vmdb/app/controllers/application_controller.rb:    def check_generic_rbac     ident = "#{controller_name}_#{action_name}"      if MiqProductFeature.feature_exists?(ident)       passed = role_allows(:feature => ident, :any => true)       unless passed         if request.xml_http_request?           render :update do |page|             page.redirect_to :controller => 'dashboard', :action => 'auth_error'           end         else           redirect_to(:controller => 'dashboard', :action => 'auth_error')         end       end       passed     else       validate_route(controller_name, request.env['REQUEST_METHOD'], action_name)     end   end   Since there is no else branch for the "if MiqProductFeature.feature_exists?(ident)", any feature that is missing from the list of known features, will be allowed by default. One of  these such features is ops_rbac_user_edit.  This is the same exact place in code that is causing [CVE-2014-0078](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0078), however, the fix for this issue solves only [CVE-2014-0078](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0078), not the problem itself. After the  fix is applied, privileges for x_button are checked, but other actions like  rbac_user_edit are allowed by default.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1067623#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2014-02-20 18:52:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1067623#c13)  Martin Povolny    2015-02-05 08:33:45 UTC  ``` I have created a hardening ticket for this here: <https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/issues/1581>  Because this has become a hardening issue rather than a security bug.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1067623#c24)  Kurt Seifried    2015-02-19 00:58:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    CloudForms Management Engine 5.3  Via RHSA-2015:0028 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0028.html>   ``` |  |
