Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the `check_generic_rbac` method within the `application_controller.rb` file of the CloudForms Management Engine (CFME). Specifically, if a requested feature was not found in the `MiqProductFeature` list, instead of denying access, the code would proceed to check only for the existence of a valid route, effectively allowing access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness was an insufficient RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) check. The code's logic defaulted to allowing access if a feature was not explicitly defined in the `MiqProductFeature` list.
-   **Incomplete Feature Definitions:** The code assumed that all features requiring access control would be defined in the `MiqProductFeature` list. However, as demonstrated by the `ops_rbac_user_edit` action, this was not the case.
-   **Logic Error:** The core logic flaw was in the `else` branch of the `if MiqProductFeature.feature_exists?(ident)` condition. The code should have denied access by default when a feature was not defined instead of validating route existence and allowing the request to proceed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user with minimal privileges could gain access to additional privileges by exploiting actions that were not properly secured, such as `ops_rbac_user_edit`.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Request:** The attack vector involved sending a web request to an action that lacked a defined RBAC feature. In this instance, the `ops_rbac_user_edit` action was cited as an example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be an authenticated user within the CFME system.
-   **Knowledge of Unprotected Actions:** The attacker would need knowledge of actions that were not protected by explicit RBAC features, such as actions like `ops_rbac_user_edit`.
