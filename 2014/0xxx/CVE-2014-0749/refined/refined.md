{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-0749",
  "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing the DIS network communication protocol. Specifically, when a request is made to read a larger amount of data than the allocated buffer size, a buffer overflow occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote and involves sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable service.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. The attacker is unauthenticated. "
  },
  "patch": "The issue is resolved in torque versions 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze4 (oldstable/squeeze), 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u3 (stable/wheezy), and 2.4.16+dfsg-1.4 (unstable/sid)."
