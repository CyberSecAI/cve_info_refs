Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple heap-based buffer overflows exist in the `ZRLE_DECODE` function within the `common/rfb/zrleDecode.h` file of TigerVNC.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `NDEBUG` flag is enabled during compilation, which disables boundary checks within the function that are normally enforced by assertions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `ZRLE_DECODE` function, when processing screen image data from a VNC server, lacks proper bounds checking due to disabled assertions, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious VNC server can cause the `vncviewer` client to crash due to the buffer overflow.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the client machine with the privileges of the user running the `vncviewer` process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious VNC server sending crafted image data to a vulnerable `vncviewer` client.
- A user must connect to this malicious VNC server to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a VNC server that a victim connects to.
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted image data that triggers the buffer overflow in the client's `ZRLE_DECODE` function.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the client-side other than being able to establish a connection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was found in TigerVNC before version 1.3.1.
- The issue is specifically triggered when NDEBUG is enabled, which disables important boundary checks in the ZRLE_DECODE function.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected because the corresponding packages were not built with `NDEBUG`.
- The fix involves replacing the asserts with explicit checks and also changing the build configuration to not use NDEBUG.
