Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0428:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content clearly indicates that CVE-2014-0428 is related to "insufficient security checks in IIOP streams" within OpenJDK's CORBA component. This matches the vulnerability described in the CVE's summary and Red Hat's security advisory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies within the OpenJDK CORBA implementation, specifically when handling IIOP streams. There are "insufficient security checks" within the code processing these streams. This weakness is present in the `com.sun.corba.se` package.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The primary vulnerability is the lack of adequate security checks when processing data within IIOP streams. This means that the code is not properly validating the integrity and safety of the data as it is received and processed via CORBA's IIOP communication protocol.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker, by exploiting the lack of input validation in the CORBA IIOP streams handling, could bypass sandbox restrictions. Specifically, this can allow an untrusted Java application or applet to perform actions they are not authorized to. Depending on the action, it could lead to:
    *   Remote unauthorized access.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data over the network.
    *   Denial of service.
  This indicates potential for a full compromise of the affected system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending a malicious IIOP stream to a vulnerable system.
*   The affected component is the CORBA functionality present in the java-1.7.0-openjdk packages

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send a malicious IIOP stream to a vulnerable system.
*   The attacker could be a remote untrusted application or applet.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-0428 highlights a significant vulnerability in OpenJDK's CORBA handling of IIOP streams, stemming from insufficient security checks. This lack of input validation allows remote attackers to potentially bypass security restrictions and compromise a system. Patches are essential. The issue appears to affect a variety of products.
