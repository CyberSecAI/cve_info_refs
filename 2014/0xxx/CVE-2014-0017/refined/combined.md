# libssh 0.6.3 (Security release)

by [Andreas](https://www.libssh.org/author/asn/ "View all posts by Andreas")|Published [March 4, 2014](https://www.libssh.org/2014/03/04/ "13:30")

This is an important SECURITY and maintenance release in order to address [CVE-2014-0017 – PRNG state reuse on forking servers](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0017).

This bug happens when a SSH server forks on new connections. OpenSSL PRNG does not always detect the change of process (PID collision) and PRNG state may be shared between two successive children. However that bug is greatly mitigated by OpenSSL ECDSA signing code itself that reseeds the PRNG on every operation.

We advise that you upgrade or patch if you use libssh to build a forked SSH server.

This is the same as before, but we messed up with the repository. So the new tarball reflects the git changes.

If you are new to libssh read [The Tutorial](http://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html) how to get started. Please [join our mailing list](http://www.libssh.org/communication/) or visit our IRC channel if you have questions.

You can download libssh 0.6.3 [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files).

## ChangeLog

* CVE-2014-0017 – PRNG state reuse on forking servers
* Fixed memory leak with ecdsa signatures.

Message-ID: <5316B8F3.60706@redhat.com>

Subject: libssh and stunnel PRNG flaws

Hi All,

Aris Adamantiadis reported the following to us:

I have found a vulnerability in stunnel (fork mode) and libssh server
(if implemented with fork) that is similar to problems found in
postgresql [1]. When accepting a new connection, the server forks and
the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of
openssl doesn't reset its state after the fork, but simply adds the
current process id (getpid) to the PRNG state, which is not guaranteed
to be unique.

stunnel uses libssl, which also seeds the PRNG with the output of
time(NULL), which means that vulnerability has to be exploited under a
second. I have exploit code that can reproduce the issue on OpenBSD 5.4
(thanks to random PIDs) but I think it may be exploitable on other unix
systems as well.

The following CVEs have been assigned:

CVE-2014-0016 stunnel PRNG vulnerability
CVE-2014-0017 libssh PRNG vulnerability

Mitigations implemented into openssl-0.9.8j (2009) makes the
vulnerability not exploitable in stock openssl. The signing code for
ECDSA and DSA explicitly seeds the pool with the digest to sign.

We advise that you upgrade or patch if you use libssh to build a forked SSH server.

This is the same as before, but we messed up with the repository. So the new tarball reflects the git changes.

If you are new to libssh read [The Tutorial](http://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html) how to get started. Please [join our mailing list](http://www.libssh.org/communication/) or visit our IRC channel if you have questions.

You can download libssh 0.6.3 [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files).

## ChangeLog

* CVE-2014-0017 – PRNG state reuse on forking servers
* Fixed memory leak with ecdsa signatures.

# USN-2145-1: libssh vulnerability

12 March 2014

A security issue was fixed in libssh.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libssh](/security/cves?package=libssh) - A tiny C SSH library

## Details

Aris Adamantiadis discovered that libssh allowed the OpenSSL PRNG state to

be reused when implementing forking servers. This could allow an attacker

to possibly obtain information about the state of the PRNG and perform

cryptographic attacks.

### Reduce your security exposure

  -
  [0.5.4-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libssh/0.5.4-1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libssh-4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libssh)

  -
  [0.5.2-1ubuntu0.12.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libssh/0.5.2-1ubuntu0.12.04.3)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-04 05:48:39 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libssh server.  When accepting a new connection, the server forks and the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of openssl doesn't reset its state after the fork, but simply adds the current process id (getpid) to the PRNG state, which is not guaranteed to be unique. The most important consequence is that servers using EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates may under certain conditions leak their private key.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Package        : libssh
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0017

It was discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library, did not reset the
state of the PRNG after accepting a connection. A server mode
application that forks itself to handle incoming connections could see
its children sharing the same PRNG state, resulting in a cryptographic
weakness and possibly the recovery of the private key.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.5-3+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-04 05:48:39 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libssh server.  When accepting a new connection, the server forks and the child process handles the request. The RAND_bytes() function of openssl doesn't reset its state after the fork, but simply adds the current process id (getpid) to the PRNG state, which is not guaranteed to be unique. The most important consequence is that servers using EC (ECDSA) or DSA certificates may under certain conditions leak their private key.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-05 05:22:52 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Aris Adamantiadis for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c3)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2014-03-05 06:00:40 UTC  ``` This issue only affects the server component of libssh library. libssh2 is not affected, since it is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol. (no server component).  Statement:  Not Vulnerable. This issue does not affect the version of libssh2 package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1072191#c5)  Huzaifa S.
