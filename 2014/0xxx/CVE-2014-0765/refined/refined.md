  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the GotoCmd argument.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
     "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends an overly long string through the GotoCmd argument to the control, which overflows the static stack buffer.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Advantech WebAccess instance. Low skill level is required."
