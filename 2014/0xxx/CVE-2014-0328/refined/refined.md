- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cobham thraneLINK protocol does not verify cryptographic signatures for firmware updates before installing them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature (CWE-347).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can deploy a malicious firmware image to a thraneLINK device and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can use the SLPFindSrvs protocol function to discover thraneLINK devices on the network.
    - The attacker sends a crafted SNMP request to have the device download a firmware update from a TFTP server under the attacker's control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs network access to the thraneLINK device.
    - Physical access or access to maintenance part of the network, which also requires physical presence at the terminal.
