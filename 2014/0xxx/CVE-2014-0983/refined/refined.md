  "CVE-2014-0983": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the `crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB` function. This function, part of the OpenGL 3D acceleration implementation in VirtualBox, uses an attacker-controlled index to write to an array. By providing a large or negative index, an attacker can achieve out-of-bounds write, corrupting arbitrary memory with an attacker-controlled pointer.",
    "root_cause": "Missing bounds check on an array index derived from user-controlled data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Validation of Array Index [CWE-129]",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Code execution in the host OS by escaping the virtual machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted OpenGL rendering commands via a 'CR_MESSAGE_OPCODES' message from a guest OS to the host OS",
       "Specifically crafted CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE (0xEA) with a malformed index"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have code execution within a guest operating system, and 3D acceleration must be enabled.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the `crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB` function, and similar vulnerabilities also exist in other functions generated by `src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/crserverlib/server_dispatch.py`. These functions handle vertex attribute opcodes. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a negative or very large index. The code in `crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB` uses the attacker-provided `index` to access the array `cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4` without proper bounds checking, writing the pointer `cr_unpackData` to the location `cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4[index]`. `cr_unpackData` is also attacker-controlled since it points to the opcode data within `cr_message_opcodes`."
