3. *Vulnerability Description*

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware,
targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.

VirtualBox provides -among many other features- 3D Acceleration for
guest machines
through its Guest Additions. This feature allows guest machines to use
the host machine's
GPU to render 3D graphics based on then OpenGL or Direct3D APIs.

Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in the code
that implements
3D Acceleration for OpenGL graphics in Oracle VirtualBox.
These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker who is already running
code within
a Guest OS to escape from the virtual machine and execute arbitrary code
on the Host OS.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.2.20 and earlier.
   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.3.6 and earlier.
   . Other versions may be affected too but they were no checked.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.3.8.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Francisco Falcon from
Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated
by Andres Blanco from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

VirtualBox makes use of the *Chromium*[1] open-source library
(not to be confused with the open-source web browser) in order to
provide 3D Acceleration for OpenGL graphics.

Chromium provides remote rendering of OpenGL graphics through a
client/server model, in which
a client (i.e. an OpenGL application) delegates the rendering to the
server, which has access
to 3D-capable hardware.

When 3D Acceleration is enabled in VirtualBox, OpenGL apps running
within a Guest OS
(acting as Chromium clients) will send rendering commands to the
Chromium server, which is
running in the context of the hypervisor in the Host OS.

The code that handles OpenGL rendering commands on the Host side is
prone to multiple memory
corruption vulnerabilities, as described below.

7.1. *VirtualBox crNetRecvReadback Memory Corruption Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0981] The first vulnerability is caused by a *design flaw* in
Chromium. The Chromium server makes use
of "*network pointers*". As defined in Chromium's documentation,
'"Network pointers are
simply memory addresses that reside on another machine.[...] The
networking layer will then
take care of writing the payload data to the specified address."'[2]

So the Chromium's server code, which runs in the context of the
VirtualBox hypervisor
in the Host OS, provides a write-what-where memory corruption primitive
*by design*, which
can be exploited to corrupt arbitrary memory addresses with arbitrary
data in the hypervisor process
from within a virtual machine.

This is the code of the vulnerable function [file
'src/VBox/GuestHost/OpenGL/util/net.c'], which can
be reached by sending a 'CR_MESSAGE_READBACK' message to the
'VBoxSharedCrOpenGL' service:

/-----
/**
 * Called by the main receive function when we get a CR_MESSAGE_READBACK
 * message.  Used to implement glGet*() functions.
 */
static void
crNetRecvReadback( CRMessageReadback *rb, unsigned int len )
{
    /* minus the header, the destination pointer,
     * *and* the implicit writeback pointer at the head. */

    int payload_len = len - sizeof( *rb );
    int *writeback;
    void *dest_ptr;
    crMemcpy( &writeback, &(rb->writeback_ptr), sizeof( writeback ) );
    crMemcpy( &dest_ptr, &(rb->readback_ptr), sizeof( dest_ptr ) );

    (*writeback)--;
    crMemcpy( dest_ptr, ((char *)rb) + sizeof(*rb), payload_len );
}

-----/

Note that 'rb' points to a 'CRMessageReadback' structure, which is fully
controlled by the
application running inside a VM that is sending OpenGL rendering
commands to the Host side.
The 'len' parameter is also fully controlled from the Guest side, so
it's possible to:

   1. decrement the value stored at any memory address within the
address space of the hypervisor.
   2. write any data to any memory address within the address space of
the hypervisor.

7.2. *VirtualBox crNetRecvWriteback Memory Corruption Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0982] The second vulnerability is closely related to the first
one, and it's also caused by Chromium's
"*network pointers*".

This is the code of the vulnerable function [file
'src/VBox/GuestHost/OpenGL/util/net.c'], which can
be reached by sending a 'CR_MESSAGE_WRITEBACK' message to the
'VBoxSharedCrOpenGL' service:

/-----
/**
 * Called by the main receive function when we get a CR_MESSAGE_WRITEBACK
 * message.  Writeback is used to implement glGet*() functions.
 */
static void
crNetRecvWriteback( CRMessageWriteback *wb )
{
    int *writeback;
    crMemcpy( &writeback, &(wb->writeback_ptr), sizeof( writeback ) );
    (*writeback)--;
}

-----/

Note that 'rb' points to a 'CRMessageWriteback' structure, which is
fully controlled by the
application running inside a VM that is sending OpenGL rendering
commands to the Host side, so it's possible to
decrement the value stored at any memory address within the address
space of the hypervisor.

7.3. *VirtualBox crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB Memory Corruption
Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0983] When an OpenGL application running inside a VM sends
rendering commands (in the form of opcodes + data for those opcodes)
through
a 'CR_MESSAGE_OPCODES' message, the Chromium server will handle them in
the 'crUnpack' function.
The code for the 'crUnpack' function is automatically generated by the
Python script located
at 'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/unpacker/unpack.py'.

This function is basically a big switch statement dispatching different
functions according to the opcode being processed:

/-----
void crUnpack( const void *data, const void *opcodes,
        unsigned int num_opcodes, SPUDispatchTable *table )
{
    [...]
    unpack_opcodes = (const unsigned char *)opcodes;
    cr_unpackData = (const unsigned char *)data;

    for (i = 0 ; i < num_opcodes ; i++)
    {
        /*crDebug("Unpacking opcode \%d", *unpack_opcodes);*/
        switch( *unpack_opcodes )
        {
            case CR_ALPHAFUNC_OPCODE: crUnpackAlphaFunc(); break;
            case CR_ARRAYELEMENT_OPCODE: crUnpackArrayElement(); break;
            case CR_BEGIN_OPCODE: crUnpackBegin(); break;
            [...]

-----/

When the opcode being processed is 'CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE'
('0xEA'),
the function to be invoked is 'crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB':

/-----
    [...]
    case CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE: crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB();
break;
    [...]

-----/

The 'crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB' function reads 5 values from the
opcode data sent by the Chromium client,
and just invokes 'cr_unpackDispatch.VertexAttrib4NubARB' with those 5
values as arguments:

/-----
static void crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB(void)
{
  GLuint index = READ_DATA( 0, GLuint );
  GLubyte x = READ_DATA( 4, GLubyte );
  GLubyte y = READ_DATA( 5, GLubyte );
  GLubyte z = READ_DATA( 6, GLubyte );
  GLubyte w = READ_DATA( 7, GLubyte );
  cr_unpackDispatch.VertexAttrib4NubARB( index, x, y, z, w );
  INCR_DATA_PTR( 8 );
}

-----/

'VertexAttrib4NubARB' is a function pointer in a dispatch table, and
points to the function
'crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB', whose code is generated by the
Python script located at
'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/crserverlib/server_dispatch.py':

/-----
void SERVER_DISPATCH_APIENTRY crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB(
GLuint index, GLubyte x, GLubyte y, GLubyte z, GLubyte w )
{
  cr_server.head_spu->dispatch_table.VertexAttrib4NubARB( index, x, y,
z, w );
  cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4[index] = cr_unpackData;
}

-----/

Note that the 'index' parameter, which is a 4-byte integer coming from
an untrusted source (the opcode data
sent by the Chromium client from the VM), is used as an index within the
'cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4'
array in order to write 'cr_unpackData' (which is a pointer to the
attacker-controlled opcode data), without
validating that the index is within the bounds of the array.
This issue can be leveraged to corrupt arbitrary memory with a pointer
to attacker-controlled data.

Also note that *the same vulnerability affects several functions* whose
code is generated by the
'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/crserverlib/server_dispatch.py'
Python script:

/-----
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1DARB_OPCODE   [0xDE]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1FARB_OPCODE   [0xDF]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1SARB_OPCODE   [0xE0]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2DARB_OPCODE   [0xE1]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2FARB_OPCODE   [0xE2]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2SARB_OPCODE   [0xE3]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3DARB_OPCODE   [0xE4]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3FARB_OPCODE   [0xE5]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3SARB_OPCODE   [0xE6]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE [0xEA]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4DARB_OPCODE   [0xEF]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4FARB_OPCODE   [0xF0]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4SARB_OPCODE   [0xF2]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4sARB

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Oracle VirtualBox 3D Acceleration Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Oracle VirtualBox 3D Acceleration Multiple Memory Corruption
Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0002
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/content/oracle-virtualbox-3d-acceleration-multiple-memory-corruption-vulnerabilities>
Date published: 2014-03-11
Date of last update: 2014-03-11
Vendors contacted: Oracle
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Improper Validation of Array Index [CWE-129], Improper Validation
of Array Index [CWE-129], Improper Validation of Array Index [CWE-129]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0981, CVE-2014-0982, CVE-2014-0983

3. *Vulnerability Description*

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware,
targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.

VirtualBox provides -among many other features- 3D Acceleration for
guest machines
through its Guest Additions. This feature allows guest machines to use
the host machine's
GPU to render 3D graphics based on then OpenGL or Direct3D APIs.

Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in the code
that implements
3D Acceleration for OpenGL graphics in Oracle VirtualBox.
These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker who is already running
code within
a Guest OS to escape from the virtual machine and execute arbitrary code
on the Host OS.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.2.20 and earlier.
   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.3.6 and earlier.
   . Other versions may be affected too but they were no checked.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Oracle VirtualBox v4.3.8.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Francisco Falcon from
Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated
by Andres Blanco from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

VirtualBox makes use of the *Chromium*[1] open-source library
(not to be confused with the open-source web browser) in order to
provide 3D Acceleration for OpenGL graphics.

Chromium provides remote rendering of OpenGL graphics through a
client/server model, in which
a client (i.e. an OpenGL application) delegates the rendering to the
server, which has access
to 3D-capable hardware.

When 3D Acceleration is enabled in VirtualBox, OpenGL apps running
within a Guest OS
(acting as Chromium clients) will send rendering commands to the
Chromium server, which is
running in the context of the hypervisor in the Host OS.

The code that handles OpenGL rendering commands on the Host side is
prone to multiple memory
corruption vulnerabilities, as described below.

7.1. *VirtualBox crNetRecvReadback Memory Corruption Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0981] The first vulnerability is caused by a *design flaw* in
Chromium. The Chromium server makes use
of "*network pointers*". As defined in Chromium's documentation,
'"Network pointers are
simply memory addresses that reside on another machine.[...] The
networking layer will then
take care of writing the payload data to the specified address."'[2]

So the Chromium's server code, which runs in the context of the
VirtualBox hypervisor
in the Host OS, provides a write-what-where memory corruption primitive
*by design*, which
can be exploited to corrupt arbitrary memory addresses with arbitrary
data in the hypervisor process
from within a virtual machine.

This is the code of the vulnerable function [file
'src/VBox/GuestHost/OpenGL/util/net.c'], which can
be reached by sending a 'CR_MESSAGE_READBACK' message to the
'VBoxSharedCrOpenGL' service:

/-----
/**
 * Called by the main receive function when we get a CR_MESSAGE_READBACK
 * message.  Used to implement glGet*() functions.
 */
static void
crNetRecvReadback( CRMessageReadback *rb, unsigned int len )
{
    /* minus the header, the destination pointer,
     * *and* the implicit writeback pointer at the head. */

    int payload_len = len - sizeof( *rb );
    int *writeback;
    void *dest_ptr;
    crMemcpy( &writeback, &(rb->writeback_ptr), sizeof( writeback ) );
    crMemcpy( &dest_ptr, &(rb->readback_ptr), sizeof( dest_ptr ) );

    (*writeback)--;
    crMemcpy( dest_ptr, ((char *)rb) + sizeof(*rb), payload_len );
}

-----/

Note that 'rb' points to a 'CRMessageReadback' structure, which is fully
controlled by the
application running inside a VM that is sending OpenGL rendering
commands to the Host side.
The 'len' parameter is also fully controlled from the Guest side, so
it's possible to:

   1. decrement the value stored at any memory address within the
address space of the hypervisor.
   2. write any data to any memory address within the address space of
the hypervisor.

7.2. *VirtualBox crNetRecvWriteback Memory Corruption Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0982] The second vulnerability is closely related to the first
one, and it's also caused by Chromium's
"*network pointers*".

This is the code of the vulnerable function [file
'src/VBox/GuestHost/OpenGL/util/net.c'], which can
be reached by sending a 'CR_MESSAGE_WRITEBACK' message to the
'VBoxSharedCrOpenGL' service:

/-----
/**
 * Called by the main receive function when we get a CR_MESSAGE_WRITEBACK
 * message.  Writeback is used to implement glGet*() functions.
 */
static void
crNetRecvWriteback( CRMessageWriteback *wb )
{
    int *writeback;
    crMemcpy( &writeback, &(wb->writeback_ptr), sizeof( writeback ) );
    (*writeback)--;
}

-----/

Note that 'rb' points to a 'CRMessageWriteback' structure, which is
fully controlled by the
application running inside a VM that is sending OpenGL rendering
commands to the Host side, so it's possible to
decrement the value stored at any memory address within the address
space of the hypervisor.

7.3. *VirtualBox crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB Memory Corruption
Vulnerability*

[CVE-2014-0983] When an OpenGL application running inside a VM sends
rendering commands (in the form of opcodes + data for those opcodes)
through
a 'CR_MESSAGE_OPCODES' message, the Chromium server will handle them in
the 'crUnpack' function.
The code for the 'crUnpack' function is automatically generated by the
Python script located
at 'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/unpacker/unpack.py'.

This function is basically a big switch statement dispatching different
functions according to the opcode being processed:

/-----
void crUnpack( const void *data, const void *opcodes,
        unsigned int num_opcodes, SPUDispatchTable *table )
{
    [...]
    unpack_opcodes = (const unsigned char *)opcodes;
    cr_unpackData = (const unsigned char *)data;

    for (i = 0 ; i < num_opcodes ; i++)
    {
        /*crDebug("Unpacking opcode \%d", *unpack_opcodes);*/
        switch( *unpack_opcodes )
        {
            case CR_ALPHAFUNC_OPCODE: crUnpackAlphaFunc(); break;
            case CR_ARRAYELEMENT_OPCODE: crUnpackArrayElement(); break;
            case CR_BEGIN_OPCODE: crUnpackBegin(); break;
            [...]

-----/

When the opcode being processed is 'CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE'
('0xEA'),
the function to be invoked is 'crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB':

/-----
    [...]
    case CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE: crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB();
break;
    [...]

-----/

The 'crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB' function reads 5 values from the
opcode data sent by the Chromium client,
and just invokes 'cr_unpackDispatch.VertexAttrib4NubARB' with those 5
values as arguments:

/-----
static void crUnpackVertexAttrib4NubARB(void)
{
  GLuint index = READ_DATA( 0, GLuint );
  GLubyte x = READ_DATA( 4, GLubyte );
  GLubyte y = READ_DATA( 5, GLubyte );
  GLubyte z = READ_DATA( 6, GLubyte );
  GLubyte w = READ_DATA( 7, GLubyte );
  cr_unpackDispatch.VertexAttrib4NubARB( index, x, y, z, w );
  INCR_DATA_PTR( 8 );
}

-----/

'VertexAttrib4NubARB' is a function pointer in a dispatch table, and
points to the function
'crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB', whose code is generated by the
Python script located at
'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/crserverlib/server_dispatch.py':

/-----
void SERVER_DISPATCH_APIENTRY crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB(
GLuint index, GLubyte x, GLubyte y, GLubyte z, GLubyte w )
{
  cr_server.head_spu->dispatch_table.VertexAttrib4NubARB( index, x, y,
z, w );
  cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4[index] = cr_unpackData;
}

-----/

Note that the 'index' parameter, which is a 4-byte integer coming from
an untrusted source (the opcode data
sent by the Chromium client from the VM), is used as an index within the
'cr_server.current.c.vertexAttrib.ub4'
array in order to write 'cr_unpackData' (which is a pointer to the
attacker-controlled opcode data), without
validating that the index is within the bounds of the array.
This issue can be leveraged to corrupt arbitrary memory with a pointer
to attacker-controlled data.

Also note that *the same vulnerability affects several functions* whose
code is generated by the
'src/VBox/HostServices/SharedOpenGL/crserverlib/server_dispatch.py'
Python script:

/-----
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1DARB_OPCODE   [0xDE]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1FARB_OPCODE   [0xDF]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB1SARB_OPCODE   [0xE0]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib1sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2DARB_OPCODE   [0xE1]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2FARB_OPCODE   [0xE2]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB2SARB_OPCODE   [0xE3]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib2sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3DARB_OPCODE   [0xE4]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3FARB_OPCODE   [0xE5]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB3SARB_OPCODE   [0xE6]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib3sARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4NUBARB_OPCODE [0xEA]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4NubARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4DARB_OPCODE   [0xEF]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4dARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4FARB_OPCODE   [0xF0]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4fARB
Opcode CR_VERTEXATTRIB4SARB_OPCODE   [0xF2]  -> function
crServerDispatchVertexAttrib4sARB

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 104 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1618213.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1618213.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 37 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 35 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.
