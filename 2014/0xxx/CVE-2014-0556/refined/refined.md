{
  "CVE-2014-0556": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the copyPixelsToByteArray method of the BitmapData object in Adobe Flash Player.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to out-of-bounds write.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By calling BitmapData.copyPixelsToByteArray() with a reference to a ByteArray that has its position property set close to 2^32.",
	  "The out-of-bounds write is triggered when the destination ByteArray position is manipulated to cause an integer overflow. The overflow will lead to an out-of-bounds write."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute ActionScript code within the context of Adobe Flash Player. Successful exploitation is possible through a malicious SWF file loaded into the player. The position field of the destination ByteArray can be manipulated to cause an integer overflow and write contents out of the ByteArray buffer. The attacker can then utilize the overflow to write arbitrary data and potentially achieve code execution.",
    "additional_details": "The overflow occurs because the position and length variables are stored as 32-bit integers even on 64-bit systems. Successful exploitation on 64-bit systems requires heap grooming due to address space layout. By creating a hole in the address space with mmap(), the attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds write in a controlled manner by using a Vector.<uint> object.",
    "affected_platforms": "Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE 8 to IE 11 and Flash 14.0.0.176, 14.0.0.145 and 14.0.0.125."
