| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-01-06 14:55:18 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Description  A vulnerability has been reported in Graphviz, which can be exploited by malicious people to  compromise a user's system.  The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "yyerror()" function (lib/cgraph/scan.l) and  can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.  The vulnerability is reported in version 2.34.0. Other versions may also be affected.   Solution: Fixed in the source code repository.  Further details available to Secunia VIM customers  Provided and/or discovered by: Reported by the vendor.  Original Advisory: <https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/commit/7aaddf52cd98589fb0c3ab72a393f8411838438a>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2014-01-11 17:53:20 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-1236 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-1236>):   Stack-based buffer overflow in the chkNum function in lib/cgraph/scan.l in   Graphviz 2.34.0 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via   vectors related to a "badly formed number" and a "long digit list."  CVE-2014-0978 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-0978>):   Stack-based buffer overflow in the yyerror function in lib/cgraph/scan.l in   Graphviz 2.34.0 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a   long line in a dot file. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pacho Ramos   gentoo-dev  2016-09-14 13:33:38 UTC  ``` the fixed version was already stabilized ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pacho Ramos   gentoo-dev  2017-01-15 10:37:38 UTC  ``` But we cannot clean vulnerable versions until [bug 594194](show_bug.cgi?id=594194 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - media-gfx/nip2-7.38.1, media-libs/vips-7.38.5 and sci-libs/matio-1.5.10 stable request") is solved ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-01-30 01:52:46 UTC  ``` This fix for CVE-2014-0978 introduced the possible buffer overflow vulnerability that received the name CVE-2014-1235.  Upstream fix:  <https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/commit/d266bb2b4154d11c27252b56d86963aef4434750>  Fix is present in =media-gfx/graphviz-2.36.0.  New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2017-02-10 23:20:33 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201702-06 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201702-06> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-07 07:15:12 UTC  ``` Graphviz, a collection of tools for the manipulation and layout of graphs, was recently reported to be affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability.  The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "yyerror()" function (lib/cgraph/scan.l) and can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.  References: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=497274>  Commit: <https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/commit/7aaddf52cd98589fb0c3ab72a393f8411838438a>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-07 07:17:06 UTC  ```  Created graphviz tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1049167](show_bug.cgi?id=1049167 "CLOSED ERRATA - graphviz: stack-based buffer overflow in yyerror() [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1049168](show_bug.cgi?id=1049168 "CLOSED ERRATA - graphviz: stack-based buffer overflow in yyerror() [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c3)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-07 08:28:29 UTC  ``` CVE Request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/28>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-07 17:19:16 UTC  ``` The original Secunia advisory is here: <http://secunia.com/advisories/55666/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c5)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 09:48:19 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-1235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1235) has been filed to address a buffer overflow vulnerability, that was introduced due to the fix implemented to fix this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c6)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-09 20:19:02 UTC  ``` This fix (the git commit noted in #c0) introduced the possible buffer overflow vulnerability that received the name [CVE-2014-1235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1235).  This commit is required in addition to the commit noted in #c0 to fully fix this flaw.  <https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/commit/d266bb2b4154d11c27252b56d86963aef4434750>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c14)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 19:16:15 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.12-10.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c15)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 23:00:23 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.34.0-8.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c16)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 23:02:15 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.30.1-12.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-19 21:23:46 UTC  ``` Impact of this flaw is mitigated by the use of FORTIFY_SOURCE hardening feature.  It prevents this issue from being exploitable for code execution.  Overflow is detected before any memory corruption happens and application is terminated (via abort()).  Hence this can only cause an unexpected termination of affected application (such us some of the graphviz command line tools, or other applications using graphviz's libcgraph library).   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-20 11:18:13 UTC  ``` As this is mitigated by the FORTIFY_SOURCE, lowering impact rating accordingly.  We are no longer planning to correct this in future updates of affected already released products.  Statement:  This issue affects the versions of the graphviz package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact and therefore it is not planned to be addressed in future updates.  This issue did not affect the versions of the graphviz package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.   ``` |  |

# CVE Request: graphviz: stack-based buffer overflow in yyerror()

---

*From*: Ratul Gupta <ratulg () redhat com>

*Date*: Tue, 07 Jan 2014 12:52:19 +0530

---

```

Hello,

```
Graphviz, a collection of tools for the manipulation and layout of
graphs, was recently reported to be affected by a buffer overflow
vulnerability.
```

```
The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "yyerror()"
function (lib/cgraph/scan.l) and can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
```

Can a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Package        : graphviz
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0978 CVE-2014-1236
Debian Bug     : 734745

Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in Graphviz, a rich
collection of graph drawing tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2014-0978

    It was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror()
    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing
    copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A
    context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input
    file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow,
    resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially
    allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-1236

    Sebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum()
    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular
    expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially
    crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a
    stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of
    arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-5+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-14+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.
