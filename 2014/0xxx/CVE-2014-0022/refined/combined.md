How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1057377#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-23 23:16:21 UTC  ``` Gabriel VLASIU reported [1] that yum-cron would install unsigned RPM packages that yum itself would refuse to install.  The yum-cron code is based on that in yum-updatesd.py.  This is due to  the installUpdates() function (processPkgs() in yum-updatesd.py) failing to fully check the return code of the called sigCheckPkg() function.  sigCheckPkg() is described thus:      def sigCheckPkg(self, po):         """Verify the GPG signature of the given package object.          :param po: the package object to verify the signature of         :return: (result, error_string)            where result is::                0 = GPG signature verifies ok or verification is not required.               1 = GPG verification failed but installation of the right GPG key                     might help.               2 = Fatal GPG verification error, give up.         """  However, the processPkgs() and installUpdates() calling function do not account for return code 2:      def processPkgs(self, dlpkgs): ...         for po in dlpkgs:             result, err = self.updd.sigCheckPkg(po)             if result == 0:                 continue             elif result == 1:                 try:                     self.updd.getKeyForPackage(po)                 except yum.Errors.YumBaseError, errmsg:                     self.failed([str(errmsg)])  and:      def installUpdates(self, emit): ...         for po in dlpkgs:             result, err = self.sigCheckPkg(po)             if result == 0:                 continue             elif result == 1:                 try:                     self.getKeyForPackage(po)                 except yum.Errors.YumBaseError, errmsg:                     self.emitUpdateFailed(errmsg)                     return False  yum-cron.py replaced yum-cron.sh in Fedora 19 (3.4.3-47); earlier versions of Fedora use yum-updatesd.  This has been corrected upstream [2] and in Fedora via yum-3.4.3-132.fc19 and yum-3.4.3-130.fc20.  This does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it used neither yum-updatesd nor yum-cron; it used a shellscript that called yum itself to do updates.

This issue was resolved in yum-cron shipped as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 before its initial release.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of yum as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1057377#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-07-31 09:20:11 UTC  ``` It should also be noted that in their default configuration, yum-updatesd and yum-cron are not configured to automatically install available updates.  They are configured to provide notification of updates availability.  yum-cron is also configured to download updated packages, but not install them.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1057377#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-05 03:34:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:1004 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1004.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1057377#c9)  Martin Prpič    2014-08-05 07:30:58 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was discovered that yum-updatesd did not properly perform RPM package signature checks. When yum-updatesd was configured to automatically install updates, a remote attacker could use this flaw to install a malicious update on the target system using an unsigned RPM or an RPM signed with an untrusted key.   ``` |  |
