Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-0022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `yum-cron` and `yum-updatesd` utilities failed to properly check the return code of the `sigCheckPkg()` function. This function is responsible for verifying the GPG signature of RPM packages.
- Specifically, the calling functions (`processPkgs()` and `installUpdates()`) did not account for a return code of '2' from `sigCheckPkg()`, which indicates a fatal GPG verification error. They only handled return codes '0' (signature verified or not required) and '1' (verification failed but key installation might help), leading to installation of packages with invalid signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient input validation:** The utilities did not fully validate the results of the signature check, allowing the installation process to proceed despite a fatal signature error.
- **Incorrect error handling:** The error handling logic was incomplete, as it did not handle all possible return codes from the signature check function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A remote attacker could potentially install malicious updates on a target system.
- This could be achieved by using unsigned RPM packages or RPM packages signed with an untrusted key.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who is able to provide malicious RPM packages to the system running `yum-cron` or `yum-updatesd` configured for automatic updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to get the vulnerable system to attempt to install a malicious package. This could be achieved through a malicious repository.
- The attacker would need to provide a crafted or unsigned RPM package.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue affects Fedora 19 and 20.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not affected as it used a different method for updates.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 was not vulnerable as the issue was resolved before it was released.
- In their default configuration, `yum-updatesd` and `yum-cron` only provide notification of updates. They are not configured to automatically install updates (except downloading them), however this still created an attack vector.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in yum version 3.4.3-132.fc19 and 3.4.3-130.fc20 for Fedora.
- A security update (RHSA-2014:1004) addresses this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
