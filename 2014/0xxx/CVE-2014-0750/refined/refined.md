- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `gefebt.exe` component within CIMPLICITY CimWebServer does not validate the source location of shell files being loaded. This lack of validation allows an attacker to modify the source location and load malicious shell code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) due to improper validation of file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending malicious shell code to the CimWebServer, which will then deploy and execute it.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests to the CimWebServer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
