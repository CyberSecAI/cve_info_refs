Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-0128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect state management within Squid when handling HTTPS requests with the SSL-Bump feature enabled, specifically in combination with range requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of state when processing range requests with SSL-Bump enabled.
- Leads to an assertion failure, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause the Squid proxy service to crash, disrupting network services for clients relying on the proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTPS request containing a range request that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Squid instance.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate HTTPS requests. Some clients can generate requests triggering the vulnerability during normal operation.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted range request

**Affected Software:**
- Squid versions 3.1 to 3.3.11 and 3.4 to 3.4.3 with SSL-Bump enabled.
- openSUSE 13.1, 12.3, 11.4
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4

**Mitigation:**
- Disable SSL-bump for affected clients using "ssl_bump none" rules.
- Disable SSL-bump completely.
- Upgrade to fixed versions of squid (3.3.12 or 3.4.4)
- Use TCP_RESET instead of Squid-generated error pages (partial workaround)
