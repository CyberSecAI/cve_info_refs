Subject: [OSSA 2014-014] Neutron security groups bypass through invalid CIDR
 (CVE-2014-0187)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-014
CVE: CVE-2014-0187
Date: April 22, 2014
Title: Neutron security groups bypass through invalid CIDR
Reporters: Stephen Ma (HP) and Christoph Thiel (Deutsche Telekom)
Products: Neutron
Versions: 2013.1 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1

Description:
Stephen Ma from Hewlett Packard and Christoph Thiel from Deutsche
Telekom reported a vulnerability in Neutron security groups. By creating
a security group rule with an invalid CIDR, an authenticated user may
break openvswitch-agent process, preventing further rules from being
applied on the host. Note: removal of the faulty rule is not enough, the
openvswitch-agent must be restarted. All Neutron setups using Open
vSwitch are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/59212>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/88674>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/88057>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the juno-1 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.1 releases.

### Bug Description

This bug is already reported in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1255338](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1255338), but no security impact is discussed in that bug so far. We have been hitting the same issue in our cloud recently, and found that it is basically breaking quantum-plugin-openvswitch-agent / neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent with errors like this:

security group was created with:

quantum security-group-rule-create default --direction egress --protocol tcp --port-range-min 80 --port-range-max 80 --remote-ip-prefix /32

Our operations team is telling me, that just removing the broken role didn't help, but "restart quantum-plugin-openvswitch-agent" was needed on all affected nodes.

IMHO, this is an issue the vulnerability management team should consider. (We have been seeing this on stable/grizzly, but havana and upcoming icehouse are also affected.)

I think that's a valid DoS vector, due to its efficiency.

Not the first time an invalid iptables rule can be passed and wreck things -- maybe they should consider testing them in a sandbox before applying them, rather than try to sanitize them and then apply them blindly...

IIUC, it depends on your configuration if it affects the whole host, ore just a namespace / tenant. Someone with deeper understanding of the agent/linux/iptables\_manager.py should give his view on the topic :)

The scope of the potential damage can vary as suggested by Cristoph.

It's not really a DoS, more an issue where security groups could be de-enforced without a user knowing it, since no information would be reflected in ports' statuses.

I agree about the security concern, but since the original bug is open, a security embargo is hardly enforceable now.

I agree this is a security concern. It prevents security group rules from being applied on a host after one installs that rule. I just reproduced this issue and tested this patch: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59212/16> which fixes the issue. I think we should focus on getting that merged asap. I'm wondering if there should also be a security CVE released though so people are aware of the issue downstream.

Even if the security aspect is not clearly described in the patch, we should assume that the patch is public and issue a CVE/OSSA on this ASAP. We can keep this bug private a bit more as we work out the details.

We'll need backports for this on stable/icehouse. Is Havana also affected ?

Yes, havana is also affected. (As is grizzly, which is no longer an issue.)

I guess the OSSA draft is going to be put into this bug for review?

@Christoph Yes, here it is.

I have a question, is the iptables-restore issue will also prevent former rules from being re-applied or will it break at the

 time the invalid rule is actually being applied ?

In such a case, the impact desc would need a note about that in case of a host reboot.

Comments:

\* would just say "Versions: 2013.1 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1" (since 2014.1 is the only "2014.1 version" that will be affected)

\* reported a vulnerability in Neutron security \*groups\*

\* I would say "bypass" rather than DoS, since it allows to evade security groups rather than deny service.

I understand Stephan Ma first reported it, but didn't point out security issue. I wouldn't mind being mentioned as well, i.e. Christoph Thiel (Deutsche Telekom) ;)

In addition to that I would recommend noting, that only Neutron setups are affected that are using the OpenVswitch.

FYI, I tried to backport the havana patch to Ubuntu 13.10 and have 3 new test failures as can be see in:

I applied patchset 10 from <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/88057/>. Am I missing another patchset?

(There are some different failures in neutron.tests.unit.ml2.drivers.test\_cisco\_mech.\* but I think this may be a problem in the testsuite.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2255-1: OpenStack Neutron vulnerabilities

25 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in OpenStack Neutron.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [neutron](/security/cves?package=neutron) - OpenStack Virtual Network Service

## Details

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Neutron

did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was

found in OpenStack Neutron, this vulnerability could be used to escalate

privileges. ([CVE-2013-6433](/security/CVE-2013-6433))

Stephen Ma and Christoph Thiel discovered that the openvswitch-agent in

OpenStack Neutron did not properly perform input validation when creating

security group rules when specifying --remote-ip-prefix. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to prevent application of

additional rules. ([CVE-2014-0187](/security/CVE-2014-0187))

Thiago Martins discovered that OpenStack Neutron would inappropriately

apply SNAT rules to IPv6 subnets when using the L3-agent. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to prevent floating IPv4

addresses from being attached throughout the cloud. ([CVE-2014-4167](/security/CVE-2014-4167))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [python-neutron](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/neutron)
  -
  [1:2014.1-0ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/neutron/1%3A2014.1-0ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [python-neutron](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/neutron)
  -
  [1:2013.2.3-0ubuntu1.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/neutron/1%3A2013.2.3-0ubuntu1.5)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

This bug is already reported in [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1255338](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1255338), but no security impact is discussed in that bug so far. We have been hitting the same issue in our cloud recently, and found that it is basically breaking quantum-plugin-openvswitch-agent / neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent with errors like this:

security group was created with:

quantum security-group-rule-create default --direction egress --protocol tcp --port-range-min 80 --port-range-max 80 --remote-ip-prefix /32

Our operations team is telling me, that just removing the broken role didn't help, but "restart quantum-plugin-openvswitch-agent" was needed on all affected nodes.

IMHO, this is an issue the vulnerability management team should consider. (We have been seeing this on stable/grizzly, but havana and upcoming icehouse are also affected.)

I think that's a valid DoS vector, due to its efficiency.

Not the first time an invalid iptables rule can be passed and wreck things -- maybe they should consider testing them in a sandbox before applying them, rather than try to sanitize them and then apply them blindly...

IIUC, it depends on your configuration if it affects the whole host, ore just a namespace / tenant. Someone with deeper understanding of the agent/linux/iptables\_manager.py should give his view on the topic :)

The scope of the potential damage can vary as suggested by Cristoph.

It's not really a DoS, more an issue where security groups could be de-enforced without a user knowing it, since no information would be reflected in ports' statuses.

I agree about the security concern, but since the original bug is open, a security embargo is hardly enforceable now.

I agree this is a security concern. It prevents security group rules from being applied on a host after one installs that rule. I just reproduced this issue and tested this patch: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/59212/16> which fixes the issue. I think we should focus on getting that merged asap. I'm wondering if there should also be a security CVE released though so people are aware of the issue downstream.

Even if the security aspect is not clearly described in the patch, we should assume that the patch is public and issue a CVE/OSSA on this ASAP. We can keep this bug private a bit more as we work out the details.

We'll need backports for this on stable/icehouse. Is Havana also affected ?

Yes, havana is also affected. (As is grizzly, which is no longer an issue.)

I guess the OSSA draft is going to be put into this bug for review?

@Christoph Yes, here it is.

I have a question, is the iptables-restore issue will also prevent former rules from being re-applied or will it break at the

 time the invalid rule is actually being applied ?

In such a case, the impact desc would need a note about that in case of a host reboot.

Impact description draft #1:

Title: Neutron security group DoS through invalid CIDR

Reporter: Stephen Ma (HP)

Products: Neutron

Versions: 2013.1 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions

Description:

Stephen Ma from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Neutron security group. By creating a security group rule with an invalid CIDR, an authenticated user may break openvswitch-agent process, preventing further rules from being applied on the host. Note: removal of the faulty rule is not enough, the openvswitch-agent must be restarted.

All Neutron setups are affected.

Comments:

\* would just say "Versions: 2013.1 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1" (since 2014.1 is the only "2014.1 version" that will be affected)

\* reported a vulnerability in Neutron security \*groups\*

\* I would say "bypass" rather than DoS, since it allows to evade security groups rather than deny service.

I understand Stephan Ma first reported it, but didn't point out security issue. I wouldn't mind being mentioned as well, i.e. Christoph Thiel (Deutsche Telekom) ;)

In addition to that I would recommend noting, that only Neutron setups are affected that are using the OpenVswitch.
