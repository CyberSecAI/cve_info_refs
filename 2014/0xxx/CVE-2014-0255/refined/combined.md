Published: May 13, 2014 | Updated: September 3, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow denial of service if an attacker sends large amounts of specially crafted iSCSI packets over the target network. This vulnerability only affects servers for which the iSCSI target role has been enabled.

This security update is rated Important for Windows Storage Server 2008 and all supported editions of Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2. It is also rated Important for iSCSI Software Target 3.3 when installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected operating systems handle iSCSI connections. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## Update FAQ

**Windows Storage Server 2008 is listed as an affected product; why is Microsoft not issuing an update for it?**

The architecture to properly support the fix provided in the update does not exist on Windows Storage Server 2008 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Windows Storage Server 2008. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Windows Storage Server 2008 operating system, not just the affected component. The product of such a re-architecture effort would be sufficiently incompatible with Windows Storage Server 2008 that there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Windows Storage Server 2008 would continue to operate on the updated system.

The impact of a denial of service attack is that a system would become unresponsive due to memory consumption. However, a successful attack requires a sustained flood of specially crafted TCP packets, and the system will recover once the flood ceases. Microsoft recommends that customers running Windows Storage Server 2008 limit the attack surface from untrusted networks by placing iSCSI on its own isolated network, separate from any network on which Internet traffic flows. For more detail on how to set up iSCSI securely, see [Installing and Configuring Microsoft iSCSI Initiator](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee338480).

**There are multiple updates listed for Windows Server 2012 R2. Do I need to install both updates?**

No. Depending on how your system is configured to receive updates, only one of the updates for Windows Server 2012 R2 will apply.

For systems running Windows Server 2012 R2:

* The 2933826 update is for systems that already have the 2919355 update installed.
* The 2962073 update is for systems without the 2919355 update installed.

**I am running Windows Server 2012 R2. Is there any prerequisite for installing the 2933826 update?**

Yes. Customers running Windows Server 2012 R2 systems must first install the 2919355 update released in April, 2014 before installing the 2933826 update. For more information about the prerequisite update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an , Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire cityâs water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
