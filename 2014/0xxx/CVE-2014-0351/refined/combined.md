## FortiNet FortiGate and FortiWiFi appliances contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#730964

Original Release Date: 2014-09-19 | Last Revised: 2014-09-19

---

### Overview

Fortinet FortiGate and FortiWiFi appliances are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks ([CWE-300](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html)) and a heap-based overflow vulnerability ([CWE-122](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)).

### Description

| Fortinet FortiGate and FortiWiFi 4.00.6 and possibly earlier versions are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks ([CWE-300](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html)) and a heap-based overflow vulnerability ([CWE-122](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)). The vulnerabilities exist in the FortiManager service running on TCP port 541.  [**CWE-300**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/300.html)**: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint ('Man-in-the-Middle')** **-** **CVE-2014-0351**The FortiManager remote service relies on client-side SSL certificates to encrypt traffic between the client and server. It is possible for a client to specify the SSL cipher suite to use for the connection, including a cipher suite that does not use certificates for authentication, such as ADH-AES256-SHA. This could allow an adjacent unprivileged attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the client and FortiManager service.[**CWE-122**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow -** **CVE-2014-2216**The FortiManager remote service uses a protocol with a message format that will allocate space for eight argument pointers on the heap. However, when parsing the message format an arbitrary number of argument pointers are accepted. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow. A remote, unprivileged attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on the appliance.The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-2216. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to man-in-the-middle traffic between the client and FortiManager service or execute arbitrary code on the appliance. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Fortinet recommends upgrading to FortiOS 4.3.16, 5.0.8, or 5.2.0 to receive the patch. Additionally, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Disable the remote management service**The FortiManager remote service that runs on port 541 can be disabled. |
