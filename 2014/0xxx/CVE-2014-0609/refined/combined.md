is known, a link to the TID that belongs to that bug as well.

tried to be as complete as possible by also adding the same list of

members.

* #### January 2013 OES11SP1 Scheduled Maintenance for eDirectory 8.8 SP7 Patch 2 Hot Patch1 - 7272

Bug 793385 - OES11 SP1 - Changing file/folder owner removes all existing trustee assignments. [TID 7011580](/kb/doc.php?id=7011580 "OES11 SP1: Modifying File or Folder ownership removes all existing trustee assignments to that file or Folder.").

* #### OES-build-key update for OES11 SP1 - 7401

Bug 805208 - Extend Novell Bangalore BuildService key expiration date.

* #### April 2013 OES11SP1 Scheduled Maintenance for eDirectory 8.8 SP7 Patch3 - 7323

For an overview of the bugs released with this patch, kindly refer to the documentation as maintained by the eDirectory team :

[TID 3426981 - History of Issues Resolved in eDirectory 8.8.x](/kb/doc.php?id=3426981 "History of Issues Resolved in eDirectory 8.8.x")

Note:
When applying eDirectory upgrades on servers that have ConsoleOne
installed in order to be able and manage GroupWise, it is to be expected
that dependency conflicts will be returned. The reason for this as that
ConsoleOne shares a number of base-modules with the eDirectory patches.

Please have a look at [TID 7010864](/kb/doc.php?id=7010864 "Applying oes11-edirectory-886-patch6-6158.noarch conflicts with novell-ndsbase.x86_64.")
for information on how to resolve these issues. (Note that although the
specified eDirectory patch in the TID may differ, the same solution
should remain applicable).

This
April 2013 Scheduled Maintenance release was initially targeted to be
released as the March 2013 Scheduled Maintenance release.

* #### July 2013 OES11SP1 Scheduled Maintenance for eDirectory 8.8 SP7 Patch 4 - 7886

For an overview of the bugs released with this patch, kindly refer to the documentation as maintained by the eDirectory team :

[TID 3426981 - History of Issues Resolved in eDirectory 8.8.x](/kb/doc.php?id=3426981 "History of Issues Resolved in eDirectory 8.8.x")

Note:
When applying eDirectory upgrades on servers that have ConsoleOne
installed in order to be able and manage GroupWise, it is to be expected
that dependency conflicts will be returned. The reason for this as that
ConsoleOne shares a number of base-modules with the eDirectory patches.

Please have a look at [TID 7010864](/kb/doc.php?id=7010864 "Applying oes11-edirectory-886-patch6-6158.noarch conflicts with novell-ndsbase.x86_64.")

Security Issues resolved with this update :

Bug CVE-2014-0595
Bug CVE-2014-0598
Bug CVE-2014-0599

* #### SLES: OpenSSL Security update - 9354

The oes11sp1-openssl-9354 patch containing mentioned fixes for OpenSSL
on SLES 11 SP2  is released through the public OES11 SP1 patch
repositories on June 23, 2014. See [TID 7012564](/kb/doc.php?id=7015264 "OpenSSL Security Advisory (05 June 2014) and Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1.").

The following security issues were fixed with this patch (bnc#880891) :

- SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)
- DTLS recursion flaw (CVE-2014-0221)
- Anonymous ECDH denial of service (CVE-2014-3470)
- Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack the nonces could have been recovered (CVE-2014-0076)

Other issues which are also fixed in this release :

-
Ensures that the stack is marked non-executable on x86 32bit. On other
processor platforms it was already marked as non-executable before
(bnc#870192).
- IPv6 support was added to the openssl s\_client and s\_server command line tool (bnc#859228).
-
The openssl command line tool now checks certificates by default
against /etc/ssl/certs (this can be changed via the -CApath option)
(bnc#860332).
- The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange
selector was enabled and can be selected by kECDHE, kECDH, ECDH tags in
the SSL cipher string (bnc#859924).
- If an optional openssl1 command
line tool is installed in parallel, c\_rehash uses it to generate
certificate hashes in both OpenSSL 0 and OpenSSL 1 style. This allows
parallel usage of OpenSSL 0.9.8j and OpenSSL 1.x client libraries with a
shared certificate store (bnc#862181).

* #### August 2014 OES 11 SP1 Scheduled Maintenance Update - 9415

This 'August 2014 Scheduled Maintenance patch' release was initially the 'July 2014 Scheduled Maintenance patch', however, since there was a security update that needed to be tested and incorporated for release, the initial July 2014 Scheduled Maintenance patch was renamed to August 2014 Scheduled Maintenance patch and release a week later than expected.

As part of the fix for Bug 885791, comprehensive checks are added to ensure that users with the right privilege can access \_admin volume on OES using CIFS.
This fix addresses a security issue that might get exposed through \_admin volume over CIFS protocol access.

This fix ensures that only LUM-enabled users can access \_admin volume. Therefore, this might cause errors while using Archive and Version services by users that are not LUM-enabled. To address this issue, ensure that the users are LUM-enabled.

* #### SLES: Mozilla Firefox security update - 9814

SLES: Mozilla Firefox security update

Mozilla Firefox was updated to the 24.8.0ESR release, fixing security issues and bugs.

Only some of the published security advisories affect the Mozilla Firefox 24ESR codestream:

    MFSA 2014-72 / CVE-2014-1567: Security researcher regenrecht reported, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, a use-after-free during text layout when interacting with the setting of text direction. This results in a use-after-free which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

    MFSA 2014-67: Mozilla developers and community identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

    Jan de Mooij reported a memory safety problem that affects Firefox ESR 24.7, ESR 31 and Firefox 31. (CVE-2014-1562)

More information is referenced on: [https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/](https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/ "Mozilla Foundation Security Advisories.")

Mozilla NSS was updated to 3.16.5 to fix a RSA certificate forgery issue.

MFSA 2014-73 / CVE-2014-1568: Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.

The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently discovered and reported this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
