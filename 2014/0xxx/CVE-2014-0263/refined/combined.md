## Vulnerability in Direct2D Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2912390)

Published: February 11, 2014 | Updated: February 28, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker would have no way to force users to view specially crafted content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to an attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Direct2D handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Microsoft Graphics Component Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2014-0263

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Windows components handle specially crafted 2D geometric figures. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views files containing such specially crafted figures using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-0263](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0263).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Direct2D fails to properly handle a specially crafted 2D geometric figure.

**What is Direct2D?**

Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode 2-D graphics API that provides high performance and high-quality rendering for 2-D geometry, bitmaps, and text. The Direct2D API is designed to interoperate with existing code that uses GDI, GDI+, or Direct3D. For more information about Direct2D, see the MSDN article, [Direct2D](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd370990).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opens a specially crafted file or browses a website that contains specially crafted content. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted website that is designed to invoke Direct2D through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.

**Note** For systems running Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, these systems are at risk from the vulnerability only if they have platform update 2670838 installed.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Direct2D handles arbitrarily large geometric figures.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.
