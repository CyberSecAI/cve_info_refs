The provided content is related to CVE-2014-0263.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Direct2D failing to properly handle specially crafted 2D geometric figures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way that affected Windows components handle specially crafted 2D geometric figures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to invoke Direct2D through Internet Explorer. This can include compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content.
- File sharing attacks: An attacker could provide a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to open it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted 2D geometric figure that triggers the vulnerability in Direct2D.
