{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-0035",
    "description": "UsernameTokens are sent in plaintext, i.e. not encrypted, by a CXF client that uses a SymmetricBinding with EncryptBeforeSigning enabled, and a UsernameToken policy that is a *EncryptedSupportingToken. No other binding is affected, and SignBeforeEncrypting is not affected either.",
    "affected_versions": "Apach CXF 2.6.x < 2.6.13, Apach CXF 2.7.x < 2.7.10",
    "root_cause": "The Apache CXF client does not encrypt the UsernameTokens before sending them, when using a SymmetricBinding with EncryptBeforeSigning enabled and an EncryptedSupportingToken policy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext transmission of sensitive information",
      "Improper encryption"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the unencrypted UsernameTokens and obtain the username and password used by the client application.",
    "attack_vector": "Network based",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be positioned to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on network communication",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability only occurs when using a SymmetricBinding with EncryptBeforeSigning enabled and an EncryptedSupportingToken policy. SignBeforeEncrypting is not affected."
