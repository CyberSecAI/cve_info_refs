Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper form construction and lack of proper hashing of password credentials within the Websense Triton Unified Security Center 7.7.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The application does not properly mask or hash password fields when displayed in the browser. Specifically, the password field is initially a `<input type="password">` element with a hashed value. However, an attacker can change the input type to `<input type="text">` via browser developer tools, causing the password to be displayed in plaintext on the page, along with the username.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated attacker, regardless of their permission level, can view stored credentials of other users, including potentially higher-privileged administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessed through a web browser after logging into the Websense Triton Unified Security Center.
*   **Browser-based Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the HTML of the page using the browser's developer tools ("Inspect Elements") to change the password input field type from "password" to "text".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid account on the Websense Triton Unified Security Center. No specific permission level is required; any authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Browser Access:** The attacker needs to be able to use a web browser and access its developer tools (e.g., "Inspect Elements").
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the network where the Websense Triton Unified Security Center is accessible.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Websense Triton Unified Security Center 7.7.3 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The issue is addressed in Triton Unified Security Center 7.7.3 Hotfix 31 and later versions, as well as in related Web Security products.
