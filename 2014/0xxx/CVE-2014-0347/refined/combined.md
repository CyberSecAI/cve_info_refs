### Description

| [CWE-200](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html): Information Exposure  When logged into the Websense Triton Unified Security Center 7.7.3 and possibly earlier versions with any permission level, it is possible to navigate to the “Log Database” or “User Directories” portions of the “Settings” module. In either section, it is possible to use a web browser to “Inspect Elements” within the page.Password blocks are initially hashed within the page using the following form variable:<input type=”password” id=”logDatabaseSettings:password” name =”logDatabaseSettings:password” maxlength=�· size=�·>However, due to the lack of proper form construction and hashing of password credentials, it is possible to change the string to the following and reload the page:<input type=”text” id=”logDatabaseSettings:password” name =”logDatabaseSettings:password” maxlength=�· size=�·>Allowing the password credentials to be displayed in plain-text, along with the associated username. |
