- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The secure flag (attribute) for the LTPA cookie is not set for SSL (https) sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The absence of the secure flag on the LTPA cookie for SSL sessions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The missing secure flag prevents browser clients from ensuring that the cookie is always encrypted when transmitted from client to server, potentially exposing the cookie in transit.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, potentially involving man-in-the-middle scenarios where an attacker could intercept the unencrypted cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
