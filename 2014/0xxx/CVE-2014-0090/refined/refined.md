Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that new session IDs were not generated upon successful login. This allowed an attacker to potentially fixate a user's session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The application did not invalidate or regenerate session IDs after a user successfully authenticated. This left the application vulnerable to session fixation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could exploit this by setting a known session ID in the user's browser. Upon a successful user login, the attacker could then use the fixated session ID to gain unauthorized access to the application with the victim's privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker would have all the privileges of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could intercept the initial request to the login page, set a specific session ID, and then observe when a user logs in using that manipulated session ID.
*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker could trick the victim into visiting a crafted link with a pre-set session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the victim's browser session ID. This could be through network interception (man-in-the-middle attack), or by luring the victim to a crafted link that sets a specific session ID before login.
*   The attacker does not need prior knowledge of the victim's credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was present in the `/users/login` URL of the Foreman application.
*   The vulnerability was also present when using SSO authentication.
*   The fix involved generating a new session ID upon successful login via `UsersController#login` and `Foreman::Controller::Authentication` (for SSO), while not doing so for API requests (where the user is not stored in session).
*   The issue was initially fixed in version 1.4.2 of Foreman.
*   The Red Hat Security Response Team rated the issue as low impact for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3 and 4.
