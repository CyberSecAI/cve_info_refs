Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a "security permissions issue" within Adobe ColdFusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of IP Address Access Control:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated local user to bypass IP address access control restrictions that are intended to protect the ColdFusion Administrator interface. This implies that the access control mechanism has a flaw that can be exploited by a local user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to ColdFusion Administrator:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the ColdFusion Administrator interface, which could potentially lead to further compromise such as configuration changes, data access or code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is a local user. This means the attacker needs to have some level of access to the server on which ColdFusion is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system running the affected ColdFusion installation.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The exploit can be performed without authentication or with a low-privilege account on the system.

**Summary of CVE-2014-0572:**

This CVE describes a vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion that allows a local, unauthenticated attacker to bypass IP-based access controls to the ColdFusion Administrator. This is a critical vulnerability because it allows unauthorized access to administrative functions, which could have far reaching consequences.
