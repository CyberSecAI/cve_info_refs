  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When a SOAP message generates a fault during parsing or processing, but is not fully consumed, the server could read the remaining data and save it to a temporary file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete input validation",
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk space, potentially causing a denial of service by filling the /tmp directory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted SOAP message that causes a parsing or processing fault"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server/application using Apache CXF",
       "Ability to craft SOAP messages"
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability exists because Apache CXF does not properly handle errors during SOAP message parsing or processing. When an error occurs, and the message is not fully consumed, the remaining data is read and saved to a temporary file. If the data is dynamically created to be very large, it can fill the /tmp directory, causing a denial of service."
