Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `handlePackagesChanged` method of the `com.android.server.DevicePolicyManagerService` class in Android versions prior to 4.4.1_r1. This method is responsible for updating the list of active device administrators. It updates `mAdminList` to reflect the removal of a device admin but fails to update the `mAdminMap`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Data Structures:** The `DevicePolicyManagerService` uses two data structures, `mAdminMap` (a HashMap) and `mAdminList` (an ArrayList), to track active device administrators. The `handlePackagesChanged` method updates only `mAdminList` when a device admin is removed, leaving `mAdminMap` inconsistent.
*   **Exploitable Logic:**  The `getActiveAdminUncheckedLocked` and `getActiveAdminForCallerLocked` methods, which are used by `isAdminActive` in `android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager`, rely solely on `mAdminMap` when the "who" parameter is non-null. This allows a malicious app to deceive the MDM app.
*   **Bypass of Device Admin Checks:** MDM apps use `isAdminActive` to check if their device administrator component is active. By exploiting the inconsistency, a malicious app can disable its own device administrator component, tricking the MDM app into thinking it is still active based on the outdated `mAdminMap`
*   **Shared User ID Exploitation:** MDM apps may use `isActivePasswordSufficient` of `DevicePolicyManager` which uses `getActiveAdminForCallerLocked` to verify if the caller has permissions. However, the check implemented there uses the `mAdminList` which is correctly updated, blocking the initial exploit. By sharing the same User ID, another dummy application can be created to trick the MDM app into thinking it has the needed permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassed MDM Policies:** An attacker can bypass MDM restrictions and policies on an Android device, including password enforcement, device locking, remote wiping, and other security controls. This gives the user access to corporate resources without actually enforcing MDM policies.
*   **False Sense of Security:** The MDM app will falsely report that it has the necessary control over the device, while in reality, the device is not compliant with corporate security policies.
*   **Data Exposure:**  Corporate data on the device can become vulnerable since the user can access it without MDM protection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application Installation:** The attacker installs a malicious app with the same package name and DeviceAdministrator component as the MDM app that they want to bypass.
*   **Disabling Device Administrator:** The malicious app disables its own DeviceAdministrator component after being granted the required rights. This triggers the vulnerable `handlePackagesChanged` code.
*   **Shared User ID Exploit:** A second application with the same shared User ID is installed to allow the MDM app to falsely think that an active device admin has the proper policies and UID.
*   **Bypass Verification:** By exploiting the vulnerability the `isActivePasswordSufficient` check can be bypassed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Install Apps:** The attacker must be able to install applications on the target Android device.
*   **Knowledge of Target MDM App:** The attacker must know the package name and DeviceAdministrator component name of the MDM app they want to bypass.
*   **Ability to create a malicious app:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious application that disables its own device administrator.
*   **Ability to repackage and sign an app:** The attacker should be able to repackage the MDM app, edit its manifest file and sign the new apk with their key.
*   **Shared User ID Knowledge:** The attacker should be aware of the shared user ID mechanism in Android apps.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability has been fixed in Android version 4.4.1\_r1 and later.
*   The content suggests that MDM apps should use `getActiveAdmins()` in addition to `isAdminActive()` for more reliable checks.
*   MDM apps should also use code protection and verify app signing certificates at runtime to mitigate risk.
