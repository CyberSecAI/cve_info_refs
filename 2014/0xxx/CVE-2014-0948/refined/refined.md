- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The 'File->Import' operation in Rational Software Architect Design Manager and Rational Rhapsody Design Manager allows uploading malicious .zip files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file upload mechanism allowing arbitrary file uploads via malicious zip files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file planting on the system by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker uploads a malicious zip file via the 'File->Import' operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access and use the 'File->Import' functionality, implying the attacker needs to be a valid user.
