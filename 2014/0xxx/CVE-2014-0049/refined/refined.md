Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module of the Linux kernel, specifically in the `complete_emulated_mmio` function in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c`.
- The issue arises when a guest OS executes a `pusha` instruction with a stack pointer that initially points to a memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) address (or an invalid guest physical address) but then extends into a valid guest physical address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow. When the guest performs repeated emulated `push` operations, the `emulator_read_write` function correctly sets `mmio_needed` to 1 when encountering MMIO addresses, which causes a KVM exit to userspace. However on subsequent pushes when the stack is in regular RAM `mmio_nr_fragments` is set to 0 without clearing `mmio_is_needed`. Upon return to the `complete_emulated_mmio` function the `vcpu->mmio_cur_fragment` variable continues to increment, eventually exceeding the bounds of its intended buffer. This leads to an out-of-bounds access when a memcpy operation is performed.
- **Incorrect State Management:** The state variables related to MMIO handling (`mmio_needed`, `mmio_nr_fragments` and `mmio_cur_fragment`) are not correctly reset, leading to the incorrect execution path and the overflow in `complete_emulated_mmio` function.
- **Use-After-Free/Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially use the overflow to cause a crash. More critically, if an attacker with precise timing destroys the VM on another VCPU, it is possible to manipulate the memory pointed to by `cancel_work_item`, which then can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host. This is achieved via `kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue` which the attacker can influence.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Guest OS Crash:** In a simple case, the vulnerability can cause a crash within the guest operating system due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Host OS Code Execution:** A sophisticated attacker, through careful timing and manipulation of the VM, can exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution on the host operating system. This is a much more serious impact, potentially allowing the attacker to take full control of the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a malicious guest operating system executing a specially crafted series of x86 instructions including `pusha`, leading to an overflow in the `complete_emulated_mmio` function.
- The more critical attack vector involves precise timing of actions in multiple vCPUs, using  `kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue` to gain control of `cancel_work_item` and achieve arbitrary host code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a KVM guest operating system. This is a prerequisite for all KVM escapes.
- For the more critical exploit path, sophisticated timing control over the VM and multiple vCPUs is required.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `f78146b0f9230765c6315b2e14f56112513389ad` in the Linux kernel.
- The fix was introduced by commit `a08d3b3b99efd509133946056531cdf8f3a0c09b` which adds a check for `vcpu->mmio_cur_fragment >= vcpu->mmio_nr_fragments` instead of using `==`.
- The fix is also present in Linux kernel 3.13.6 and later versions.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were not affected as the problematic upstream commits were not backported into those releases.

In summary, CVE-2014-0049 is a critical vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM module. It's a complex flaw stemming from incorrect handling of MMIO emulation within the guest. While a simple exploitation results in a guest crash, a skilled attacker can leverage it to gain host system control via memory corruption.
