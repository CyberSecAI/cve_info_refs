- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM SPSS Analytic Server jobs produce logs that contain a password in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information (password) is logged in plaintext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated users can view the plaintext password by accessing the logs.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the logs can view the plaintext password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system with access to the logs.
