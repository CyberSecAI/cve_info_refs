{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a security domain is configured to use a cache, this cache is shared between all applications within that security domain.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Shared security domain cache between applications allows for unintended access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user authenticated in one application could potentially access protected resources in another application within the same security domain, despite not being authorized.",
  "Attack vectors": "A user authenticated in one application within the security domain could potentially access resources in another application within the same security domain.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a valid user within at least one application within the affected security domain."
