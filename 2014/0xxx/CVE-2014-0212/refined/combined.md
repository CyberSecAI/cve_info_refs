### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1073285#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-06 07:00:50 UTC  ``` Frantisek Reznicek of Red Hat reported that a change in or before qpid version 0.22 resulted in ACL policies only being loaded if the acl-file option was specified. This resulted in qpidd, by default, not checking the connection limit. A client could send a large number of requests to qpidd, resulting in the file descriptor limit being reached and qpidd refusing to handle further connections.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1073285#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-06 08:24:07 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Frantisek Reznicek of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1073285#c3)  David Jorm    2014-05-08 09:36:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of qpid-cpp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6; Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2; and Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging 3.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1073285#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2014-10-21 07:05:25 UTC  ``` MRG-M 3.0 GA [1] was not affected by this issue.
