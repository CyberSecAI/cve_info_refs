{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-0212",
  "description": "qpid-cpp: ACL policies only loaded if the acl-file option specified enabling DoS by consuming all available file descriptors",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "ACL policies are only loaded when the acl-file option is explicitly specified. The default behavior of qpidd does not check connection limits.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the fact that access control list (ACL) policies for connection limits are not loaded by default."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a large number of connection requests to qpidd. This would result in consuming all available file descriptors, leading to qpidd refusing further connections and causing service unavailability.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and the ability to send multiple connection requests.",
     "cvssScore": "7.5",
