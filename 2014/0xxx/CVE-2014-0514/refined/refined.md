  "cve": "CVE-2014-0514",
  "description": "Adobe Reader for Android exposes several insecure Javascript interfaces. This issue can be exploited by opening a malicious PDF in Adobe Reader. Exploiting this issue allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code, which can result in a compromise of the documents stored in Reader and files stored on SD card.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Reader for Android exposes Javascript interfaces. The application did not properly restrict access to the public Reflection APIs of the `Object` class through these interfaces.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Javascript interfaces",
        "Lack of proper access control on exposed Java methods",
        "Exposure of public Reflection APIs"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary Java code execution, leading to potential compromise of documents stored in the app and files on the SD card.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious PDF file containing Javascript code is opened using Adobe Reader for Android.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF and deliver it to the victim."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Adobe Reader Mobile 11.1.3 and earlier for Android"
   ],
  "fixes": [
    "Adobe released version 11.2.0 of Adobe Reader that add `@JavascriptInterface` annotations to public methods that should be exposed in the Javascript interfaces. In addition, the app now targets API Level 17 and contains a static method (`shouldInitializeJavaScript()`) that is used to check the device's Android version."
  ],
  "additional_info": "The vulnerable interfaces are exposed in the classes `ARJavaScript`, `ARCloudPrintActivity`, and `ARCreatePDFWebView`. The Javascript objects are prefixed with an underscore character, e.g., `_app`, `_doc`, etc. The proof of concept demonstrates how arbitrary code can be executed by using `java.lang.Runtime` class"
