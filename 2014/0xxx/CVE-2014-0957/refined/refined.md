Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input in error situations when invoking a service via a URL in IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition and IBM Business Process Manager (BPM). Specifically, user-provided input, including potentially malicious scripts, can be reflected back in unhandled service failure responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious scripts injected through URL parameters can be executed within the context of the user's browser when an error occurs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data or internal error details can also be disclosed in these unhandled error responses, which may provide valuable information to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of internal error data or sensitive information could aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious scripts in service input parameters. These URLs would need to be accessed by a target user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that will trigger the error condition within the affected application.
*   The attacker needs to trick a target user into accessing the crafted URL (e.g., via phishing or other social engineering techniques).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered during unhandled service failure situations
*   The error response including user input and/or a stack trace is returned to the user

**Affected Products and Versions (as mentioned in the IBM Security Bulletin):**

*   IBM Business Process Manager Standard V8.5.x, 8.0.x, and 7.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager Express V8.5.x, 8.0.x, and 7.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V8.5.x, 8.0.x, and 7.5.x
*   IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition 7.2

**Remediation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by installing interim fix JR49990. The interim fix prevents detailed error information from being returned to the end userâ€™s browser.
