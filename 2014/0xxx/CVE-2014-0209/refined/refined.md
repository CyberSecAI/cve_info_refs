  "CVE-2014-0209": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow during memory allocation while parsing font metadata files (fonts.dir and fonts.alias).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the X.Org server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user adding a new directory to the font path, triggering the parsing of a large malicious font metadata file.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user authenticated to the X server."

    "Root cause": "Unvalidated length fields in X Font Server (xfs) protocol replies.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
    "Impact": "An X client crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the X.Org server.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious X.org font server sending crafted replies.",
