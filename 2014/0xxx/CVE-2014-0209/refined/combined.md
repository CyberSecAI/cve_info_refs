| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-05-12 06:29:16 UTC  ``` When a local user who is already authenticated to the X server adds a new directory to the font path, the X server calls libXfont to open the fonts.dir and fonts.alias files in that directory and add entries to the font tables for every line in it.  A large file (~2-4 gb) could cause the allocations to overflow, and allow the remaining data read from the file to overwrite other memory in the heap.  Affected functions: FontFileAddEntry(), lexAlias()   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the X.org project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ilja van Sprundel as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-13 17:36:43 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=05c8020a49416dd8b7510cbba45ce4f3fc81a7dc> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=2f5e57317339c526e6eaee1010b0e2ab8089c42e>   External Reference:  <http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2014-May/002431.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-13 17:44:14 UTC  ```  Created libXfont tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1097397](show_bug.cgi?id=1097397 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0211 CVE-2014-0210 CVE-2014-0209 libXfont: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 18:11:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c4)  Fedora Update System    2014-07-16 02:01:06 UTC  ``` libXfont-1.4.8-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

Sidhpurwala    2014-11-10 06:31:09 UTC  ``` I decided to revisit this flaw after a long time and reading the commit message + patch it seems the issue may not really exists.   "lexAlias() reads from a file in a loop. It does this by starting with a 64 byte buffer. If that size limit is hit, it does a realloc of the buffer size << 1, basically doubling the needed length every time the length limit is hit. Eventually, this will shift out to 0 (for a length of ~4gig), and that length will be passed on to realloc(). A length of 0 (with a valid pointer) causes realloc to free the buffer on most POSIX platforms, but the caller will still have a pointer to it, leading to use after free issues."  When realloc is passed zero via the size arguement, it actually frees the pointer and returns null.   If you carefully look at the code, this output is checked via:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/dirfile.c?id=05c8020a49416dd8b7510cbba45ce4f3fc81a7dc#n385>  before actually using the pointer.  So when nbuf is null, the function bails out, i dont think an issue really exists here.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-10 08:07:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c6)) > When realloc is passed zero via the size arguement, it actually frees the > pointer and returns null.   I see both Linux and posix man pages say:    If size was equal to 0, either NULL or a pointer suitable to be passed   to free() is returned.  Glibc info pages do not seem to mention anything about the special size == 0 behavior.  Quick look at the code suggests glibc should guarantee NULL.  However, there's other thing you're missing.  Both tokenBuf and tokenSize are static.  Hence if you trigger the post-realloc if (!nbuf) check, tokenBuf will still contain non-NULL pointer to a chunk of memory that was freed in realloc(0), which should lead to use-after-free on the next lexAlias() call, afaics.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-11-12 08:19:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c7))  > However, there's other thing you're missing.

There is no next lexAlias() call. When EALLOC is returned by lexAlias(). The calling function ReadFontAlias() breaks out of the loop at:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/dirfile.c?id=05c8020a49416dd8b7510cbba45ce4f3fc81a7dc#n310>  Closes the fontfile and bails out.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-12 09:08:27 UTC  ``` Is there a guarantee that ReadFontAlias() is not called against before process exist, e.g. for the next font file?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-12 09:10:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c9)) > Is there a guarantee that ReadFontAlias() is not called against before > process exist, e.g. for the next font file?  ... not called again before process exit ...   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c11)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-11-12 09:47:55 UTC  ``` Here is the call path:  Catalogue* () |_ FontFileInitFPE()     |_ FontFileReadDirectory()  -> Available to devels as an API to libXfont         |_ ReadFontAlias()              |_ lexAlias()   At each level during the call-path, the return value is checked and there is a provision to bail out, if its value is anything but "Successful".  FontFileReadDirectory() is available as an API to libXfont. It has a return value as well and developers using this function, should really check it.  I am going to ask the package maintainer to re-confirm. There is no value in sending this to upstream at the time.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c12)  Benjamin Tissoires    2014-11-12 15:29:08 UTC  ``` [foreword, I just step up as libX* maintainer, so I may not be 100% accurate]  From what I can read in the code, without the CVE patch, this path is possible:  FontFileReadDirectory() is called first |_ ReadFontAlias() |  |_ lexAlias() -> EALLOC, tokenBuf freed but not NULL, and tokenSize != 0 |  |_ -> AllocError |_ -> AllocError  A program can then call again FontFileReadDirectory():  FontFileReadDirectory() |_ ReadFontAlias()    |_ lexAlias(): count < tokenSize so we use the freed tokenBuf  So if a developer does not check the return value of FontFileReadDirectory(), or tries again (you never know, sometime it works the second attempt...), then the CVE is triggered.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c15)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-11-17 04:49:31 UTC  ``` Based on the analysis in [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c6) and others, it seems like arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user running Xorg (root user) would indeed be possible in this case.  Because of which this issue was re-evaluated to have important security impact.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-11-18 11:42:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:1870 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1870.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1096593#c18)  Martin Prpič    2014-11-19 08:17:26 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way libXfont processed certain font files when attempting to add a new directory to the font path.

## Synopsis

Important: libXfont security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1893)

## Topic

Updated libXfont packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libXfont packages provide the X.Org libXfont runtime library. X.Org is
an open source implementation of the X Window System.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way libXfont processed certain font
files when attempting to add a new directory to the font path. A malicious,
local user could exploit this issue to potentially execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the X.Org server. (CVE-2014-0209)

Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way libXfont parsed
replies received from an X.org font server. A malicious X.org server could
cause an X client to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the X.Org server. (CVE-2014-0210, CVE-2014-0211)

Red Hat would like to thank the X.org project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Ilja van Sprundel as the original reporter.

Users of libXfont should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve this issue. All running X.Org server instances
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

X.Org Security Advisory:  May 13, 2014
X Font Service Protocol & Font metadata file handling issues in libXfont
========================================================================

Description:
============

Ilja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered
several issues in the way the libXfont library handles the responses
it receives from xfs servers, and has worked with X.Org's security team
to analyze, confirm, and fix these issues.

Most of these issues stem from libXfont trusting the font server to send
valid protocol data, and not verifying that the values will not overflow
or cause other damage.   This code is commonly called from the X server
when an X Font Server is active in the font path, so may be running in a
setuid-root process depending on the X server in use.  Exploits of this
path could be used by a local, authenticated user to attempt to raise
privileges; or by a remote attacker who can control the font server to
attempt to execute code with the privileges of the X server.  (CVE-2014-XXXA
is the exception, as it does not involve communication with a font server,
as explained below.)

The vulnerabilities are:

- CVE-2014-0209: integer overflow of allocations in font metadata file parsing

    When a local user who is already authenticated to the X server adds
    a new directory to the font path, the X server calls libXfont to open
    the fonts.dir and fonts.alias files in that directory and add entries
    to the font tables for every line in it.  A large file (~2-4 gb) could
    cause the allocations to overflow, and allow the remaining data read
    from the file to overwrite other memory in the heap.

    Affected functions: FontFileAddEntry(), lexAlias()

- CVE-2014-0210: unvalidated length fields when parsing xfs protocol replies

    When parsing replies received from the font server, these calls do not
    check that the lengths and/or indexes returned by the font server are
    within the size of the reply or the bounds of the memory allocated to
    store the data, so could write past the bounds of allocated memory when
    storing the returned data.

    Affected functions: _fs_recv_conn_setup(), fs_read_open_font(),
    fs_read_query_info(), fs_read_extent_info(), fs_read_glyphs(),
    fs_read_list(), fs_read_list_info()

- CVE-2014-0211: integer overflows calculating memory needs for xfs replies

    These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
    is needed to handle the returned data have not overflowed, so can
    result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
    data past the end of the allocated buffer.

    Affected functions: fs_get_reply(), fs_alloc_glyphs(),
    fs_read_extent_info()

Affected Versions
=================

X.Org believes all prior versions of this library contain these flaws,
dating back to its introduction in X11R5.

Which are available now from:
      git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/lib/libXfont
      <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/>

Fixes will also be included in these module releases from X.Org:
      libXfont 1.4.8
      libXfont 1.4.99.901 (1.5.0 RC 1)

Thanks
======

X.Org thanks Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive for reporting these issues to our
security team and assisting them in understanding them and evaluating our
fixes, and Alan Coopersmith of Oracle for coordinating the X.Org response and
developing the fixes for these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2211-1: libXfont vulnerabilities

14 May 2014

Several security issues were fixed in libXfont.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libxfont](/security/cves?package=libxfont) - X11 font rasterisation library

## Details

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that libXfont incorrectly handled font

metadata file parsing. A local attacker could use this issue to cause

libXfont to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code in order to gain

privileges. ([CVE-2014-0209](/security/CVE-2014-0209))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that libXfont incorrectly handled X Font

Server replies. A malicious font server could return specially-crafted data

that could cause libXfont to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.10

and Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0210](/security/CVE-2014-0210), [CVE-2014-0211](/security/CVE-2014-0211))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096597#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-05-12 06:33:38 UTC  ``` When parsing replies received from the font server, these calls do not check that the lengths and/or indexes returned by the font server are within the size of the reply or the bounds of the memory allocated to store the data, so could write past the bounds of allocated memory when storing the returned data.  Affected functions: _fs_recv_conn_setup(), fs_read_open_font(), fs_read_query_info(), fs_read_extent_info(), fs_read_glyphs(), fs_read_list(), fs_read_list_info()   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the X.org project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Ilja van Sprundel as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1096597#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-13 17:39:08 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=d338f81df1e188eb16e1d6aeea7f4800f89c1218> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=5fa73ac18474be3032ee7af9c6e29deab163ea39> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=520683652564c2a4e42328ae23eef9bb63271565> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=a3f21421537620fc4e1f844a594a4bcd9f7e2bd8> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=491291cabf78efdeec8f18b09e14726a9030cc8f> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=cbb64aef35960b2882be721f4b8fbaa0fb649d12> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=891e084b26837162b12f841060086a105edde86d>   External Reference:  <http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2014-May/002431.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1096597#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-13 17:44:32 UTC  ```  Created libXfont tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1097397](show_bug.cgi?id=1097397 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0211 CVE-2014-0210 CVE-2014-0209 libXfont: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1096597#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 18:11:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1096597#c4)  Fedora Update System    2014-07-16 02:01:08 UTC  ``` libXfont-1.4.8-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2927-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : libxfont
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0209 CVE-2014-0210 CVE-2014-0211

Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in the
X.Org libXfont library, which may allow a local, authenticated user to
attempt to raise privileges; or a remote attacker who can control the
font server to attempt to execute code with the privileges of the X
server.

CVE-2014-0209

    Integer overflow of allocations in font metadata file parsing could
    allow a local user who is already authenticated to the X server to
    overwrite other memory in the heap.

CVE-2014-0210

    libxfont does not validate length fields when parsing xfs protocol
    replies allowing to write past the bounds of allocated memory when
    storing the returned data from the font server.

CVE-2014-0211

    Integer overflows calculating memory needs for xfs replies could
    result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
    data from the font server past the end of the allocated buffer.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.1-5.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.5-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.7-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxfont packages.
