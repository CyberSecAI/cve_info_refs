  "CVE-2014-0451": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the OpenJDK JRE related to information disclosure, data integrity and availability. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service or expose sensitive data over the network. It was discovered that the AWT toolkit did not properly handle the toolkit threads. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.  It was discovered that FlavorMaps were not properly separated between different AppContexts. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.  The activation framework did not properly protect the default command map. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of AWT toolkit threads, incorrect FlavorMap separation, and improper protection of the activation framework default command map.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper thread handling",
        "Incorrect data separation",
        "Improper permission checks"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could cause denial of service, expose sensitive data over the network, or bypass Java sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attacker",
		"Untrusted Java application",
        "Untrusted Java applet"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to execute malicious Java code, either remotely or via a malicious applet."
