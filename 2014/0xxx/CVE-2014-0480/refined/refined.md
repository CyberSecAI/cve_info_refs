    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-0480",
      "root_cause": "Improper URL generation in the `reverse()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `reverse()` function could generate scheme-relative URLs when provided with input starting with `//`."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could use the scheme-relative URLs to redirect users to a different host, enabling phishing and other attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the input to the `reverse()` function, causing it to generate URLs to arbitrary hosts."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `reverse()` function, typically when an end user can control the target of a redirect."
