## In this article

## Vulnerabilities in Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2984615)

Published: August 12, 2014 | Updated: August 27, 2014

**Version:** 3.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Windows handles thread-owned objects, by correcting the way in which specially crafted font files are handled in memory by Windows, and by correcting the way in which memory is allocated. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 27, 2014? What happened to the original 2982791 security update?**

To address known issues with security update 2982791, Microsoft rereleased MS14-045 to replace the 2982791 update with the 2993651 update for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft expired update 2982791 on August 15, 2014. All customers should apply the 2993651 update, which replaces the expired 2982791 update. Microsoft strongly recommends that customers who have not uninstalled the 2982791 update do so prior to applying the 2993651 update.

**I already successfully installed the original 2982791 security update and am not experiencing any difficulties. Should I apply the replacement update (2993651) released on August 27, 2014?**

Yes. All customers should apply the 2993651 update, which replaces the expired 2982791 update. Customers do not need to uninstall the expired 2982791 update before applying the 2993651 update; however, Microsoft strongly recommends it. Customers who do not remove the expired update will retain a listing for 2982791 under installed updates in Control Panel.

**I uninstalled the original 2982791 security update. Should I apply the August 27, 2014 rereleased update (2993651)?**

Yes. To be protected from CVE-2014-0318 and CVE-2014-1819, all customers should apply the rereleased update (2993651), which replaces the expired 2982791 update.

**What if I experienced difficulties restarting my system after installing security update 2982791?**

Customers who experienced difficulties restarting their systems after installing security update 2982791 should no longer experience this problem after installing the replacement update (2993651). For more information about the problem with update 2982791, see the **Known Issues** section of [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2982791](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2982791).

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 15, 2014?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to address known issues associated with installation of security update 2982791. Microsoft is investigating behavior associated with the installation of this update, and will update this bulletin when more information becomes available. Microsoft recommends that customers uninstall this update. As an added precaution, Microsoft has removed the download links to the 2982791 security update. For instructions on how to uninstall this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2982791](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2982791).

**I am running Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1. Why am I not being offered the 2993651 or the 2976897 updates?**

To be offered any security updates on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1, the 2919355 update must be installed on the system. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355).

**For Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1 are there any prerequisites for the 2993651 or the 2976897 updates?**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
