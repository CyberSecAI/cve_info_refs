Hello!

A bug in the experimental SPDY implementation in nginx 1.5.10 was found,
which might allow an attacker to corrupt worker process memory by using
a specially crafted request, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
execution (CVE-2014-0088).

The problem only affects nginx 1.5.10 on 32-bit platforms, compiled with
the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default), if
the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive is used in a configuration
file.

The problem is fixed in nginx 1.5.11.

Patch for the problem can be found here:

Thanks to Lucas Molas, researcher at Programa STIC, Fundaci√≥n Dr. Manuel
Sadosky, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
