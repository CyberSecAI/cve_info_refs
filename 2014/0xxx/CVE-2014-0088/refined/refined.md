- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the experimental SPDY implementation of nginx.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to a specially crafted request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution may be possible.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted request via the SPDY protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted SPDY request to a vulnerable nginx server. The server must be running nginx version 1.5.10 on a 32-bit platform, compiled with the `ngx_http_spdy_module`, and the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive must be used in the configuration.
