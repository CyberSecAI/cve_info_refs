Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-0376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) component of OpenJDK and IBM Java.
*   Specifically, the issue is a failure to properly check code permissions when creating document builder factories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient permission checks:** The code does not properly validate whether the calling code has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions related to document builder factories. This lack of proper checks allows for potential security bypasses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Java sandbox restrictions:** A malicious or untrusted Java application or applet could exploit this vulnerability to circumvent Java sandbox restrictions. This is possible because the attacker can utilize a compromised document builder factory or inject malicious data into the application.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not always directly stated, exploiting the sandbox bypass can ultimately enable the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Data integrity:** The data may be tampered with by a malicious user, which leads to a loss of integrity.
*   **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability can be exploited to reveal potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a malicious or untrusted Java application or applet. This means that code downloaded through a browser or run via Web Start could potentially exploit this vulnerability if proper safeguards are not in place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a Java application or applet on a vulnerable system, or needs to use an external service using a vulnerable version of java.
*   The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious data or manipulate external XML data.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix for the vulnerability involves enhancing JAXP to always use the default DOM implementation when the Security Manager is present.
*   Upgrading the version of Java to include the patch will resolve the vulnerability.
*   The flaw is related to how DocumentBuilderFactory objects are instantiated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from Red Hat also mentions "XML canonicalizer mutable strings passed to untrusted code" as an issue linked with CVE-2014-0376, which indicates a possible secondary attack vector or a deeper explanation of the flaw.
*   Several documents indicate that the fix requires a restart of Java application for the changes to take effect.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Java, including IBM and OpenJDK.
*   The security updates include fixes for multiple CVEs, demonstrating the wide scope of vulnerabilities addressed in a single patch.
