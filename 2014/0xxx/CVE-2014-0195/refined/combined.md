How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle has received specific reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply these Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

Oracle acknowledges Dana Taylor of netinfiltration.com for bringing to Oracle's attention a number of sites that were vulnerable to disclosure of sensitive information because Oracle CPU fixes were not applied to those sites for more than a year.

This Critical Patch Update contains 154 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on September 26, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169 "Bash"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-7169.html) and other publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting GNU Bash. Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1912224.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1912224.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 22 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Problem Description**
  The SOAP monitor is unable to handle parameters containing nested (two or more dimension) arrays or those that are referenced externally in the 'multiRef' style.
## Installation information

For AIX, if upgrading from an ISM 6.0.1 release, you must uninstall the product and perform a new install. This does not apply for other ISM 6 releases. For more information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21321186>

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)
 [Installing on Linux or UNIX systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_unix_itcam.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.4.0.0. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.40.00.13'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Troubleshooting installation problems from the Support site

For more detailed information, refer to the Installation and Configuration Guide: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_install_chapter.html>

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

For detailed instructions, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.4.0.0 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.4.0.0/ism/dita/ag/topic/ISM_uninstall_chapter.html>

# CVE-2014-0195

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0191.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0196.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0195 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0195)

#### Description

The dtls1\_reassemble\_fragment function in d1\_both.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a long non-initial fragment.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

[CVSS v2 Scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm)
|  | National Vulnerability Database |
| Base Score | 6.8 |
| Vector | AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P |
| Access Vector | Network |
| Access Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality Impact | Partial |
| Integrity Impact | Partial |
| Availability Impact | Partial |

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

According to our research, openssl before 0.9.8o is not affected by this overflow problem. The DTLS fragment reassembly was rewritten for 0.9.8o and older versions used different methods. So openssl 0.9.8j as used by SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and older versions are not affected. Please also not that this problem only affects the Datagram TLS (over UDP) not the regular TLS over TCP which is more common.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [880891](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=880891) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [885777](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=885777) [RESOLVED / INVALID], [915913](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915913) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to the Java SE Kerberos client.
3. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

             CVE-2013-4238
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vSphere product updates address a Cross Site Scripting issue,
   a certificate validation issue and security vulnerabilities in
   third-party libraries.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server Appliance 5.1 Prior to Update 3

   VMware vCenter Server 5.5 prior to Update 2
   VMware vCenter Server 5.1 prior to Update 3
   VMware vCenter Server 5.0 prior to Update 3c

   VMware ESXi 5.1 without patch ESXi510-201412101-SG

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      VMware         Product    Running   Replace with/
      Product        Version    on        Apply Patch

      vCSA           5.0        any       Not Affected

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM
      service.

      VMware would like to thank The Google Security Team for reporting
      this issue to us.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Invalid CVSS vector, please try again with a valid CVSS vector.

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N//E:/RL:/RC:/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Fusion Middleware

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 36 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2015 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1 1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# CVE-2014-0198

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0197.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0203.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0198 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0198)

#### Description

The do\_ssl3\_write function in s3\_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.x through 1.0.1g, when SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS is enabled, does not properly manage a buffer pointer during certain recursive calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via vectors that trigger an alert condition.

The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.

For HP IceWall products which bundle OpenSSL, an OpenSSL software update is
available at the following location:

<http://www.hp.com/jp/icewall_patchaccess>

For RHEL, apply RHEL's OpenSSL patch:

<https://h20564.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay/?docId=emr_n>
a-c04336637

HP recommends the following mitigation information to protect against
potential risk for the following HP IceWall products.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw and MCRP

If possible, do not use SHOST setting which allows IceWall SSO Dfw or MCRP to
use SSL/TLS for back-end web server connection.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw Certd

If possible, set LDAPSSL to 0 to make HP SSO IceWall Certd to not use SSL/TLS
on any connection with LDAP server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

before 1.0.1h did not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec
messages, which allowed man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a
zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a
crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability
(bnc#915913).
- CVE-2014-3470: The ssl3\_send\_client\_key\_exchange function in s3\_clnt.c
in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h,
when an anonymous ECDH cipher suite is used, allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and client crash) by
triggering a NULL certificate value (bnc#915913).

## Known issues

### Non APAR Defect 13042 - ISM agent doesn't start after upgrading Windows Box

**Problem Description**
  The Windows ISM agent is stopped after an upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support changes to define old and new agent registry keys.
 **Workaround**
  Reconfigure the ISM agent after the upgrade to resolve the problem.

### Non APAR Defect 10767 - ISM support file upgrades overwrites ismconfig.props

**Problem Description**
  ISM support files upgrades overwrite ismconfig.props. Note: ISM monitor props files are NOT overwritten.
 **Root cause**
  The installer does not support not overwriting ismconfig.props.
 **Workaround**
  Backup the ismconfig.props file before performing an upgrade of ISM support.

### Non APAR Defect 13701 - ismconfig.cmd fails to accept multiple white space enclosed in quotes(") in SOAP parameters

**Problem Description**
  ismconfig.cmd truncates multiple white spaces in SOAP parameters. For example the following SOAPInputs: @SOAPInputs [itinerary:{from:string,dest:string}[]=[{from='Perth,\" \",Australia',dest='Sydney'}]]"
 **Root cause**
  This problem is due to the command line interpretation of escaping the quotation character.
 **Workaround**
  Write command into a text file and use the ismconfig.cmd -file command to import the command(s).

### Non APAR Defect 14498 - Internet Service Monitor 7.3.0.1 upgrade fails with no existing image to upgrade error

**Problem Description**
  When upgrading the ISM the upgrade can fail with the following error:
 mkdir: 0653-357 Cannot access directory /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses.
 /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 cp: /opt/IBM/ITM/licenses/isv730: A file or directory in the path name does not exist.
 KCIIN2593E
 The CD you are trying to install is a fixpack CD and cannot be installed on a machine without an existing image to upgrade.
 **Root cause**
  The installation script expects the following directory to exist in the previous installation: $CANDLEHOME/licenses

 If this doesn't exists it cannot detect the previous ISM installation correctly causing the upgrade to stop.
 **Workaround**
  Create the $CANDLEHOME/licenses directory and re-run the installation.
 Refer to the [technote](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21618763) for more information.

## Known limitations

### Non APAR Defect 16289 - Remote Upgrade

**Problem Description**
  Remote upgrades using the tacmd updateAgent command on Linux x86\_64 fails. Please use a local installation for this Operating System.
### Change of Summarized Data

**Problem Description**
  After upgrading earlier versions of the ISM application, summarized data may not be visible, since the summarization behaviour has changed. This issue can be resolved by re-summarizing your existing detailed data. Please refer to this [technote](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21443517) for more information.
### SOAP Monitor Does Not Support Nested Arrays or multiRef Values

**Problem Description**
  The SOAP monitor is unable to handle parameters containing nested (two or more dimension) arrays or those that are referenced externally in the 'multiRef' style.
## Installation information

For AIX, if upgrading from an ISM 6.0.1 release, you must uninstall the product and perform a new install. This does not apply for other ISM 6 releases. For more information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21321186>

For Linux 64-bit, if upgrading from the original ISM 7.1.0.0 release with no fix packs applied, you must uninstall the 7.1.0.0 ISM component and perform a new install. This does not apply to other releases. For more detailed information, refer to the following support document: <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21330976>

For Windows installation, if you encounter the message "Another version of this product is already installed" follow the instructions in the following support document to diagnose and resolve the problem. Note that although this technote refers to ITM, the diagnosing and resolving steps are applicable to ITCAM for Transactions Internet Service Monitoring. <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21587068>

## Prior to installation

The update installer should perform the following steps for you automatically. You can, if necessary, perform them manually.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).
2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped.

1. Stop ITM agents and infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS):
 The ITM agents and infrastructure only need to be stopped when either the application support packages are being installed or ISM is being installed on the ITM machine. If ISM is being installed on a machine that does not contain any ITM infrastructure, the ITM infrastructure does not need to be stopped.

Use the Manage Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services (MTEMS) dialog or the command line tools (`ITM\bin\tacmd` or `ITM/bin/itmcmd`) to stop any running ITM agents or infrastructure (including TEMS and TEPS).

On Windows systems, you can start the MTEMS application from your Start menu or by running `ITM\InstallITM\kinconfg.exe`. Alternatively, if you have installed ITM, use the command `ITM\bin\tacmd stopAgent <type>`.

On UNIX systems, you can run MTEMS using the `ITM/bin/itmcmd manage` command. Alternatively, use the commands `ITM/bin/itmcmd agent stop <type>` and `ITM/bin/itmcmd server stop <TEMS name>`.

2. Ensure the Databridge and Monitors have stopped:
 When the KISAgent is stopped, it automatically signals for the monitors and databridge to be shutdown. If this does not occur or has been disabled by configuration changes, you may need to perform this step manually.

On Windows systems use the Windows Services dialog to look for any 'NCO \* Internet Service Monitor' services. To stop the databrige and monitors ensure that each of these 'NCO \*' services are stopped.

On UNIX systems run `ps -ef |grep nco\_m\_` and issue a `kill <pid>` command for each entry shown. If the databridge or monitors were heavily loaded, they may take some time to shutdown. You may also use `kill -9 <pid>` to immediately stop the databridge or monitors, but this may result in loss or corruption of data being processed.

## Installing

This maintenance package is applied directly to the Tivoli Enterprise Management Agent (TEMA). In addition, apply application support from this interim fix to the following ITM components:

* - Tivoli Enterprise Management Servers (TEMS), including any remote or failover TEMS configurations
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)
* - Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), including any locally installed desktop TEP clients

On Windows systems, extract the files from the archive and double-click WINDOWS\setup.exe. Follow the prompts to install the update.

On UNIX systems, extract the installer from the archive using the **tar -xvf <filename.tar>** command. Then, execute the installer using the **./install.sh** command. Follow the prompts to install the update.

It is also possible to deploy this interim fix remotely using ITM TEMS depot and tacmd AddBundles command. For more information, please refer to the ITCAM for Transactions v7.3.0.1 Installation and Configuration Guide, available here: <http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/remotedeploy.html>
 **Installing application support for TEPS/TEMS**
 For each monitoring agent installed, you must install agent-specific application support on IBM Tivoli Monitoring components. You can choose to install application support on all components at one time, or you can install the application support on components separately. If installing components separately, the following order is recommended:

1. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server
2. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server
3. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop Client
4. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server Browser client (for Linux and UNIX Only)

The procedure for installing agent-specific application support on the components is similar to installing the monitoring agent. The main difference is to select the application support components required.

 **Note:** When installing application support **any ITM components on the current machine is automatically stopped, including any TEMS or TEPS.** Follow the [Starting and stopping servers and agents](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/rt/Install_Guide/startstopagent.html) guide to manually stop ITM agents and infrastructure. You should warn other users before beginning the installation.

 For step by step application support installation information refer to the documentation:
 [Installing Internet Service Monitoring on Windows systems](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v24r1/topic/com.ibm.itcamt.doc_7.3.0.1/ism/dita/ag/task/ISM_install_win_itcamt.html)

## Performing the necessary tasks after installation

A successful installation modifies the ISM version to 7.3.0.1. Ensure that the Version of Internet Service Monitoring in the MTEMS is '07.30.01.29'.

On Windows the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM\InstallITM\

On Unix the installation logs are written to the following directory:
 ITM/logs/

## Uninstalling if necessary

This maintenance package cannot be rolled back.

On Windows, you must run the following command prior to uninstalling the product to remove the Windows Services created during the install:
 ITM\TMAITM6\ism\platform\win32\bin\preuninstall.cmd
 The product may then be removed using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs.

On UNIX,the product may be removed using the script:
 ITM/bin/uninstall.sh

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are generally cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 113 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Please note that on April 18, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160 OpenSSL "Heartbleed"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-0160.html). This Critical Patch Update includes an update to MySQL Enterprise Server 5.6 and this update includes a fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-0160. Customers of other Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the [fixes](/security-alerts/opensslheartbleedcve-2014-0160.html)  that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1666884.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4150&id=1666884.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4236&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 20 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4170&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

– F‑Secure Total customer

It just seems to work well in the back­ground and F‑Secure have kept my computers safe for many years.

– F-Secure Internet Security Customer

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201407-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, possibly
allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1h-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1h-r1**revision >= **1.0.0m**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p1**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p2**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p3**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p4**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p5**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p6**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p7**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p8**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p9**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p10**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p11**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p12**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p13**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p14**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p15** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 Jun 2014] and the CVE identifiers
referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted DTLS fragments to an
OpenSSL DTLS client or server to possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process using OpenSSL.

Furthermore, an attacker could force the use of weak keying material in
OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers, inject data across sessions, or
cause a Denial of Service via various vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1h-r1"

```

An update that fixes 37 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for libopenssl0\_9\_8 fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2016-0800 aka the "DROWN" attack (bsc#968046): OpenSSL was
vulnerable to a cross-protocol attack that could lead to decryption of
TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites
as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle.
This update changes the openssl library to:
\* Disable SSLv2 protocol support by default.
This can be overridden by setting the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_SSL2" or by using SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options using the
SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2 flag.
Note that various services and clients had already disabled SSL
protocol 2 by default previously.
\* Disable all weak EXPORT ciphers by default. These can be reenabled if
required by old legacy software using the environment variable
"OPENSSL\_ALLOW\_EXPORT".
- CVE-2016-0797 (bnc#968048): The BN\_hex2bn() and BN\_dec2bn() functions
had a bug that could result in an attempt to de-reference a NULL pointer
leading to crashes. This could have security consequences if these
functions were ever called by user applications with large untrusted
hex/decimal data. Also, internal usage of these functions in OpenSSL
uses data from config files or application command line arguments. If
user developed applications generated config file data based on
untrusted data, then this could have had security consequences as well.
- CVE-2016-0799 (bnc#968374) On many 64 bit systems, the internal fmtstr()
and doapr\_outch() functions could miscalculate the length of a string
and attempt to access out-of-bounds memory locations. These problems
could have enabled attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is
passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions
in this way then they could have been vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses
these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data.
Therefore applications that print this data could have been vulnerable
if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications
could also have been vulnerable when they print out ASN.1 data, or if
untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not
considered directly vulnerable.
- The package was updated to 0.9.8zh:
\* fixes many security vulnerabilities (not seperately listed):
CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-1788, CVE-2015-1789, CVE-2015-1790,
CVE-2015-1792, CVE-2015-1791, CVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287,
CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0293, CVE-2015-0209, CVE-2015-0288,

CVE-2014-3505, CVE-2014-3508, CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0221,
CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-3470, CVE-2014-0076, CVE-2013-0169,
CVE-2013-0166
- avoid running OPENSSL\_config twice. This avoids breaking engine loading.

- fix CVE-2015-3197 (boo#963415)
\* SSLv2 doesn't block disabled ciphers

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2014-0224

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-0223.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-0226.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-0224 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224)

#### Description

OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1103598#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-06-02 07:40:03 UTC  ``` As per the upstream advisory:  A buffer overrun attack can be triggered by sending invalid DTLS fragments to an OpenSSL DTLS client or server. This is potentially exploitable to run arbitrary code on a vulnerable client or server.  Only applications using OpenSSL as a DTLS client or server affected.  OpenSSL 0.9.8 DTLS users should upgrade to 0.9.8za OpenSSL 1.0.0 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.0m. OpenSSL 1.0.1 DTLS users should upgrade to 1.0.1h.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jüri Aedla as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1103598#c2)  Huzaifa S.
