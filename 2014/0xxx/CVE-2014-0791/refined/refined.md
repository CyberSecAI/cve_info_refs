{
  "CVE-2014-0791": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the license_read_scope_list function in libfreerdp/core/license.c in FreeRDP through 1.0.2 allows remote RDP servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large ScopeCount value in a Scope List in a Server License Request packet.",
    "Root cause": "The `license_read_scope_list` function reads a `scopeCount` from the network and uses it in a multiplication operation without proper bounds checking. This can lead to an integer overflow when calculating the memory allocation size.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Unvalidated input leading to out-of-bounds memory allocation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to application crash, and potentially other unspecified impacts",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RDP server can send a crafted Server License Request packet with a large `scopeCount` value.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a RDP server that connects to a vulnerable FreeRDP client. No authentication is required, and the attacker is positioned as a server."
