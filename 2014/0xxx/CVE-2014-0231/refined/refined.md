## CVE-2014-0231

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way the `mod_cgid` module in Apache HTTP Server handles CGI scripts that do not read data from their standard input (stdin).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by a logic error in the `mod_cgid` module. When a CGI script does not consume stdin, the httpd child process handling the request can hang indefinitely.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS). By sending a specially crafted request to a server running a vulnerable version of Apache, the attacker can make the httpd child process responsible for handling the request to hang indefinitely, exhausting server resources.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, exploiting a server configured to use the `mod_cgid` module and host vulnerable CGI scripts. An attacker sends a specifically crafted request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to a web server that utilizes the vulnerable `mod_cgid` module and hosts CGI scripts. No special privileges or authentication is required on the server itself.
