| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1071780#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-03 07:24:42 UTC  ``` It was found that, when the Sudo env_reset option was disabled (it is enabled by default), certain environment variables were not blacklisted as expected. A local user authorized to run commands using sudo could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code, allowing them to escalate their privileges.  This issue affects Sudo versions 1.6.9 to 1.8.4p5. Versions 1.8.5 and later are not affected.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Todd C. Miller for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Sebastien Macke as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071780#c5)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: sudo: security policy bypass when env_reset is disabled

Summary:
    If the env_reset option is disabled in the sudoers file, a
    malicious user with sudo permissions may be able to run arbitrary
    commands with elevated privileges by manipulating the environment
    of a command the user is legitimately allowed to run.

Sudo versions affected:
    Sudo 1.6.9 through 1.8.4p5 inclusive.  Sudo 1.8.5 and higher
    are not affected.

CVE ID:
    This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-0106 in the Common
    Vulnerabilities and Exposures database.

Details:
    Sudo has two methods of constructing the environment that the
    command run by it will use.  The default method (since sudo
    1.6.9) is to execute the command with a new, minimal environment.
    The new environment contains the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL,
    LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME, SUDO_COMMAND, SUDO_USER, SUDO_UID and
    SUDO_GID variables in addition to variables from the invoking
    process permitted by the env_check and env_keep options.  This
    is effectively a whitelist for environment variables.

    If, however, the env_reset option is disabled, any variables
    not explicitly denied by the env_check and env_delete options
    are inherited from the invoking process.  In this case, env_check
    and env_delete behave like a blacklist.  Since it is not possible
    to blacklist all potentially dangerous environment variables,
    use of the default env_reset behavior is encouraged.

    Beginning with sudo 1.6.9, it is also possible to specify extra
    environment variables on the command line.  These variables are
    supposed to be subject to the same restrictions as the invoking
    user's environment, unless the user is allowed to set arbitrary
    variables either via the SETENV attribute or by virtue of having
    sudo "ALL".

    Due to a logic bug in the validate_env_vars() function, if the
    env_reset option is disabled, environment variables specified
    on the command line are permitted when they should not be (and
    vice versa).  This can be used by a malicious user to run
    arbitrary programs by manipulating the environment of a command
    the user is legitimately allowed to run.  For example, on many
    systems the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is used to load a
    dynamic shared object before any shared libraries are loaded.
    By either replacing a library function called by the program,
    or by including an _init() function in the shared object, the
    user can execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

    The code that contains the bug was rewritten for sudo 1.8.5,
    which does not suffer from the same security issue.

Impact:
    For sudo versions prior to 1.8.5, if the env_reset option is
    explicitly disabled in the sudoers file, a malicious user with
    sudo permissions may be able to run arbitrary commands with
    elevated privileges.  There is no impact for sudo 1.8.5 and
    higher, or when the sudoers file does not disable env_reset.

Fix:
    A fix for the sudo 1.7.x branch is included in sudo 1.7.10p8.
    The actual fix is a single line change to env.c:
	<http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/748cefb49422>
    Sudo versions 1.8.5 and higher are not vulnerable.

Workaround:
    Only systems with sudoers files that explicitly disable env_reset
    are affected.  As such, a simple workaround is to simply not
    disable env_reset, which is the default behavior.

Credit:
    I'd like to thank Sebastien Macke for reporting this bug and
    providing a fix.

# Security policy bypass when env\_reset is disabled

Mar 5, 2014

If the *env\_reset* option is disabled in the sudoers file,
a malicious user with sudo permissions may be able to run arbitrary
commands with elevated privileges by manipulating the environment
of a command the user is legitimately allowed to run.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo 1.6.9 through 1.8.4p5 inclusive. Sudo 1.8.5 and higher are not
affected.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2014-0106](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0106)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

## Details:

Sudo has two methods of constructing the environment that the command
run by it will use. The default method (since sudo 1.6.9) is to
execute the command with a new, minimal environment. The new
environment contains the `TERM`, `PATH`, `HOME`, `MAIL`, `SHELL`, `LOGNAME`,
`USER`, `USERNAME`, `SUDO_COMMAND`, `SUDO_USER`, `SUDO_UID` and `SUDO_GID`
variables in addition to variables from the invoking process permitted
by the *env\_check* and *env\_keep* options. This is
effectively a whitelist for environment variables.

If, however, the *env\_reset* option is disabled, any variables
not explicitly denied by the *env\_check* and *env\_delete*
options are inherited from the invoking process. In this case,
*env\_check* and *env\_delete* behave like a blacklist.
Since it is not possible to blacklist all potentially dangerous
environment variables, use of the default *env\_reset* behavior
is encouraged.

Beginning with sudo 1.6.9, it is also possible to specify extra
environment variables on the command line. These variables are
supposed to be subject to the same restrictions as the invoking
user’s environment, unless the user is allowed to set arbitrary
variables either via the `SETENV` attribute or by virtue of having
sudo `ALL`.

Due to a logic bug in the `validate_env_vars()` function, if the
*env\_reset* option is disabled, environment variables specified
on the command line are permitted when they should not be (and vice
versa). This can be used by a malicious user to run arbitrary
programs by manipulating the environment of a command the user is
legitimately allowed to run. For example, on many systems the
`LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is used to load a dynamic
shared object before any shared libraries are loaded. By either
replacing a library function called by the program, or by including
an `_init()` function in the shared object, the user can execute
arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

The code that contains the bug was rewritten for sudo 1.8.5, which
does not suffer from the same security issue.

## Impact:

For sudo versions prior to 1.8.5, if the *env\_reset* option
is explicitly disabled in the sudoers file, a malicious user with
sudo permissions may be able to run arbitrary commands with elevated
privileges. There is no impact for sudo 1.8.5 and higher, or when
the sudoers file does not disable *env\_reset*.

## Fix:

A fix for the sudo 1.7.x branch is included in sudo 1.7.10p8. The
actual fix is a
[single line
change to env.c](https://git.sudo.ws/sudo/commit/?id=1edea5baa4ff1abf8cf2d37fd347b273ee9c5810).
Sudo versions 1.8.5 and higher are not vulnerable.

## Workaround:

Only systems with sudoers files that explicitly disable *env\_reset*
are affected. As such, a simple workaround is to simply not disable
*env\_reset*, which is the default behavior.

## Credit:

I’d like to thank Sebastien Macke for reporting this bug and providing
a fix.

# USN-2146-1: Sudo vulnerabilities

13 March 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Sudo.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [sudo](/security/cves?package=sudo) - Provide limited super user privileges to specific users

## Details

Sebastien Macke discovered that Sudo incorrectly filtered environment

variables when the env\_reset option was disabled. A local attacker could

use this issue to possibly run unintended commands by using environment

variables that were intended to be blocked. In a default Ubuntu

installation, the env\_reset option is enabled by default. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0106](/security/CVE-2014-0106))

It was discovered that the Sudo init script set a date in the past on

existing timestamp files instead of using epoch to invalidate them

completely. A local attacker could possibly modify the system time to

attempt to reuse timestamp files. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 13.10. (LP: #1223297)

* [sudo-ldap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo)
  -
  [1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo/1.8.3p1-1ubuntu3.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [sudo](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo)
  -
  [1.7.2p1-1ubuntu5.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/sudo/1.7.2p1-1ubuntu5.7)

### Bug Description

Sudo treats filestamps set to epoch as invalid, so the init script should set the contents of /var/lib/sudo to epoch, and not 19850101.

ie:

find /var/lib/sudo -exec touch -d @0 '{}' \;

instead of:

find /var/lib/sudo -exec touch -t 198501010000 '{}' \;

    - debian/rules:

      + compile with --without-lecture --with-tty-tickets --enable-admin-flag

      + install man/man8/sudo\_root.8 in both flavours

      + install apport hooks

    - debian/sudoers:

    - debian/sudo.pam:

      + Use pam\_env to read /etc/environment and /etc/default/locale

        environment files. Reading ~/.pam\_environment is not permitted due to

        security reasons.

    - Remaining patches:

      + keep\_home\_by\_default.patch: Keep HOME in the default environment

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:0266 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: sudo security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0266)

## Topic

An updated sudo package that fixes one security issue is now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
certain users the ability to run commands as root.

A flaw was found in the way sudo handled its blacklist of environment
variables. When the "env\_reset" option was disabled, a user permitted to
run certain commands via sudo could use this flaw to run such a command
with one of the blacklisted environment variables set, allowing them to run
an arbitrary command with the target user's privileges. (CVE-2014-0106)

Note: This issue does not affect the default configuration of the sudo
package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat would like to thank Todd C. Miller for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Sebastien Macke as the original reporter.

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
