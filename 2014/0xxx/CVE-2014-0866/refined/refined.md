Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-0866:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The RICOS fat client submits user credentials in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plain-text transmission of passwords.
- Lack of encryption for authentication data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and intercept user credentials.
- Stolen credentials allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access the system.
- This vulnerability also applies to the Blotter, which also sends unencrypted credentials during authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network eavesdropping via MitM attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network between the RICOS fat client and the backend server.
- Ability to intercept network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects both the RICOS fat client and the Blotter.
- Credentials are sent via HTTP without encryption.
- The advisory provides a proof of concept describing that the fat client does not use HTTPS to communicate with the server.
