    "CVE-2014-0593": {
      "root_cause": "The set_version script, a source validator for the Open Build Service (OBS), did not properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically within its usage of sed commands and `ls` command, and `echo` command potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server executing the script.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack via crafted input parameters to the `set_version` script."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to influence the input parameters to the `set_version` script.",
      "details": "The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 0.5.3-1.1 of obs-service-set_version. The `set_version` script used user-provided input unsafely, leading to command injection vulnerabilities through the sed command. Specifically, the script used the `$MYVERSION` variable in a way that allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by including special characters in the version string. Additionally, the script used the `$MYVERSION` variable in a `ls` command without proper escaping, and also in echo command also without proper escaping, which would also lead to code execution. The vulnerable code segments are:\n\n```bash\nsed \"0,/^Version:\\(\\s\\*\\)[^%]\\*/s//Version:\\1$MYVERSION/\" \"$FILE\" > \"$MYOUTDIR/$FILE\"\nFILE=`ls -1 _service:*[-_]${MYVERSION}*  | head -n 1`\necho Unknown parameter $1.\n```\n\n\nThe fix involved rewriting the bash script in Perl to perform input sanitization and mitigate command injection. The patched version of the script uses a more secure way to handle user-provided data and avoids calling shell commands with user input directly. The fix was implemented in commit [10d5bdd](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-set_version/commit/10d5bddcea29f74a175f7f550924bf6407e52e93).\n\nThe SUSE page on CVE-2014-0593 also provides additional information such as:\n\n*   CVSS v2 Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)\n*   CVSS v3 Score: 9.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n*   SUSE Bugzilla entry: 866966\n*   Fixed packages: `obs-service-set_version >= 0.5.11-1.3.1` for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 12 SP5, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 12 SP5; and `obs-service-set_version >= 0.5.3-4.2` for openSUSE Tumbleweed.",
