SAP Netweaver Enqueue Server Trace Pattern Denial of Service Vulnerability

1. **Advisory Information**

Title: SAP Netweaver Enqueue Server Trace Pattern Denial of Service
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0007
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/sap-netweaver-enqueue-server-trace-pattern-denial-service-vulnerability>
Date published: 2014-10-15
Date of last update: 2014-10-15
Vendors contacted: SAP
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. **Vulnerability Information***
*
Class: Uncontrolled Recursion [CWE-674]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0995

3. **Vulnerability Description**

        SAP Netweaver [1] is a technology platform for building and
integrating SAP business
        applications. A vulnerability has been found in SAP Netweaver
that could allow an
        unauthenticated, remote attacker to create denial of service
conditions. The vulnerability
        is triggered by sending a specially crafted SAP Enqueue Server
packet to remote TCP port 32NN
        (NN being the SAP system number) of a host running the
"Standalone Enqueue Server" service, part
        of SAP Netweaver Application Server ABAP/Java. The "Standalone
Enqueue Server" is a critical
        component of a SAP Netweaver installation in terms of
availability, rendering the whole SAP
        system unresponsive.

4. **Vulnerable Packages**

   . SAP Netweaver 7.01 (enserver.exe version v7010.32.15.63503).
   . SAP Netweaver 7.20 (enserver.exe version v7200.70.18.23869).

    Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. **Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds**

        Martin Gallo proposed the following actions to mitigate the
impact of the vulnerabilities:

        Restrict access to the Standalone Enqueue service by configuring
Access Control Lists [4] and to
        the Standalone Enqueue Service TCP port 32XX (XX is the instance
number).

        SAP published a security note [3] with the fix.

6. **Credits**

      This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo
from Core Security Consulting
      Services. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by
Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core
      Advisories Team.

7. **Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code**

      When the trace level of the service is configured to stop logging
when a pattern is found [2], the
      service does not properly control the amount of recursion
resulting in a stack overflow exception.
      The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by setting the trace
level with a wildcard Trace Pattern.
      This vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker
to conduct a denial of service
      attack against the vulnerable systems, rendering the Enqueue
Server unavailable.

      The following python code can be used to trigger the vulnerability:

7.1. **Proof of Concept**

/-----
import socket, struct
from optparse import OptionParser

# Parse the target options
parser = OptionParser()
parser.add_option("-d", "--hostname", dest="hostname", help="Hostname",
default="localhost")
parser.add_option("-p", "--port", dest="port", type="int", help="Port
number", default=3200)
(options, args) = parser.parse_args()

def send_packet(sock, packet):
    packet = struct.pack("!I", len(packet)) + packet
    sock.send(packet)

# Connect
print "[*] Connecting to", options.hostname, "port", options.port
connection = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connection.connect((options.hostname, options.port))

print "[*] Sending crash packet"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
