{
  "CVE-2014-0104": {
    "Description": "The fence-agents package before version 4.0.17 does not verify remote SSL certificates in the `fence_cisco_ucs.py` script, which can potentially allow for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers using arbitrary SSL certificates.",
    "Root cause": "The `fence_cisco_ucs.py` script, and other fence agents using HTTPS, were not validating the remote SSL certificates by default. This behavior was introduced by a change in a previous bug fix. Specifically, the script had SSL certificate verification disabled by default, instead of enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default settings",
      "Lack of SSL certificate verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially spoof SSL servers using arbitrary SSL certificates. This could lead to unauthorized access to the fenced resources or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the fence agent and the remote device to intercept and modify network traffic."
