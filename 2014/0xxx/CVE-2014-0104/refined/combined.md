| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:04:25 UTC  ``` Michael Samuel reported that fence-agents does not verify remote SSL certificates in the fence_cisco_ucs.py script.  This could potentially allow for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via arbitrary, yet valid, SSL certificates.  This script did verify the validity of SSL certificates by default, but this behaviour was changed due to [bug #691392](show_bug.cgi?id=691392), which introduced this behaviour via RHBA-2011:0834 [1].  * The fence_cisco_ucs script no longer checks the validity of SSL certificates by default. ([BZ#691392](show_bug.cgi?id=691392))  Also note that this behaviour appears in the fence_rhevm.py script as well.   [1] <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2011-0834.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:09:32 UTC  ``` Michael suggested the following as a potential idea of how to fix:   I've changed my mind on how to fix. I think the easiest fix would be to add an option to pin a cert using CURLOPT_CAINFO (which takes a filename). This way the cert is pinned - even a real CA can't issue a spoofed certificate.  RHEV/vdsm would need be modified to support this - presumably by passing the certificate data and writing it to a tempfile, which would be passed to the fence agent.  When the cert is supplied, SSL_VERIFY_HOST can be turned off, otherwise the default CA bundle should be used with SSL_VERIFY_HOST on.  For those not wanting to pin a cert, they can enable the non-SSL webserver in UCS Manager for equivalent security.    (Personally I think that could work, but also an option of --insecure-ssl or something to disable those checks and default to them being on would work just as well).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:15:11 UTC  ``` The commit that introduced the problem:  <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fence-agents.git/commit/?id=1ef8f0605ef021a7f0045d9be19497ef95a2a16e>  Or made the problem worse anyways.  We should have the cURL defaults set and override them to be insecure only when asked.  <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER> <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST>  So this:  fence-agents-4.0.2/fence/agents/cisco_ucs/fence_cisco_ucs.py:   c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0) fence-agents-4.0.2/fence/agents/cisco_ucs/fence_cisco_ucs.py:   c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0)  should probably be:  c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1) c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2)  and then they should be dropped to 0 only when specifically asked, either via a commandline arg or a configuration option.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:18:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned [CVE-2014-0104](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0104).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-01 22:30:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Samuel for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 09:56:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c1)) > I've changed my mind on how to fix. I think the easiest fix would be to add > an option to pin a cert using CURLOPT_CAINFO (which takes a filename). This > way the cert is pinned - even a real CA can't issue a spoofed certificate.  Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.  (That's for curl + nss, may differ when curl uses different crypto backend.)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)  Marek Grac    2014-03-03 10:37:48 UTC  ``` I agree that this can be a possible security problem but we are not able to change that behaviour as it will make a regression. Running clusters will stop working. We can:  * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default)  IMHO the problem can be avoided when users follow documentation: "It is highly recommended to separate the private network for cluster heartbeat from the application network." On such network a MITM attacks are rare.   The other problem is that the majority of the fence devices accessible via https use only self-signed certificates.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-03 23:18:06 UTC  ``` I agree with the above.  While I would prefer to see an --insecure-ssl option for rhel5/6 instead of a --secure-ssl one (secure by default) I can see this being disruptive to many customers who are expecting and using it this one way.  I would however note the problems via documentation.  Unless someone really disagrees with that, I think that is entirely reasonable.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-04 07:59:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marek Grac from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)) > * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) > * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default)  Would it make sense to add both to all versions, and alias --ssl to one of them?  That can probably make transitions easier (e.g. users can change their configuration they use on RHEL-6 to use e.g. --insecure-ssl so the same configuration work with RHEL-7 too).  Option to specify CA certificate(s) probably makes sense too, so that updating system ca-bundle is not the only way to make secure ssl work with custom CA.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c11)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-04 08:07:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c10)) > (In reply to Marek Grac from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)) > > * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) > > * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default) >  > Would it make sense to add both to all versions, and alias --ssl to one of > them?

Yes it sounds a very sensible approach to me.  Marek?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c12)  Marek Grac    2014-03-04 09:34:03 UTC  ``` If we want to fix that issue we will have to handle all fence agents which work over HTTPS. There are four of them according to <https://access.redhat.com/site/node/28603>  * fence_ilo for HP iLO1/iLO2 - based on gnutls-cli * fence_rhevm for RHEV-M - based on pycurl (REST API) * fence_cisco_ucs for Cisco UCS - based on pycurl (REST API) * fence_vmware_soap for VMWare vSphere - based on suds (SOAP API)  Adding support for --secure-ssl: * gnutls-cli backend: different command-line options  * pycurl backend: described above and on <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.htm> * suds backend: does not have direct support but there is a possible work-around described at <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6277027/suds-over-https-with-cert>  Option to specify a CA certificate is not a problem. I agree that we can do --ssl as an synonym for --(in)secure-ssl according to RHEL version.  The main problem that I can see is testing. We will need all mentioned machines with valid / valid (custom CA) / invalid (self-signed) certificates. There are quite a lot ilo2 machines, RHEV-M and VMWare should be easy to access, the only one which is hard to obtain is Cisco UCS. I had access to one in 2010, so I expect that it is still somewhere in Red Hat [contact person was Chris Wright]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c13)  Marek Grac    2014-03-04 13:30:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870423](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=diff "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=edit "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure  Patch that adds a support for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure.  It does not change situation for fence_vmware_soap because I found out that solutions are based on packages which are not available in rhel7. It is possible to do a little hack (until next minor release). We can check validity of certificate using pycurl (as in rhevm, cisco_ucs) and then use SOAP library as before. It means that verification will not be done in step but it will be done.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c18)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-04 20:16:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870617](attachment.cgi?id=870617&action=diff "New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870617&action=edit "New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap") New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap  The logic in setting was incorrect as --ssl-insecure would automatically imply --ssl and SSL_VERIFY* was never set to 0.  New patch defaults to --ssl and/or --ssl-secure, and allows --ssl-insecure to override the settings.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c19)  Michael Samuel    2014-03-04 21:56:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marek Grac from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c13)) > Created [attachment 870423](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=diff "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=edit "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") > Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure >  > Patch that adds a support for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure. >  > It does not change situation for fence_vmware_soap because I found out that > solutions are based on packages which are not available in rhel7.

I suggest fixing the SOAP library.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c20)  Michael Samuel    2014-03-05 03:57:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)) > Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO > rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  > Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self > signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.  (That's for curl + nss, > may differ when curl uses different crypto backend.)  In the case of Cisco UCS, the default self-signed certificate doesn't contain any basic constraints.  It also allows generating certificate requests for use with a CA.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c21)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-05 04:49:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Samuel from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c20)) > (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)) > > Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO > > rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  > > Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self > > signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.

If you have access to a Cisco UCS in the house, we would very much like to have temporary access and test with a proper certificate. The one I used to unit testing in the fence-agents bug has only the self-signed certificate and we are not allowed to change it.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c22)  Marek Grac    2014-03-05 11:55:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870924](attachment.cgi?id=870924&action=diff "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870924&action=edit "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)") Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)  Fabio's patch + fix for fence_vmware_soap (change of underlying transport library)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c23)  Michael Samuel    2014-03-11 22:20:59 UTC  ``` I discussed access with Fabio outside of BZ - it is no longer required.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c24)  Michael Samuel    2014-09-28 11:28:27 UTC  ``` Can we please unembargo this?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c25)  Vincent Danen    2014-10-10 15:12:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of fence-agent as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:04:25 UTC  ``` Michael Samuel reported that fence-agents does not verify remote SSL certificates in the fence_cisco_ucs.py script.  This could potentially allow for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via arbitrary, yet valid, SSL certificates.  This script did verify the validity of SSL certificates by default, but this behaviour was changed due to [bug #691392](show_bug.cgi?id=691392), which introduced this behaviour via RHBA-2011:0834 [1].  * The fence_cisco_ucs script no longer checks the validity of SSL certificates by default. ([BZ#691392](show_bug.cgi?id=691392))  Also note that this behaviour appears in the fence_rhevm.py script as well.   [1] <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2011-0834.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:09:32 UTC  ``` Michael suggested the following as a potential idea of how to fix:   I've changed my mind on how to fix. I think the easiest fix would be to add an option to pin a cert using CURLOPT_CAINFO (which takes a filename). This way the cert is pinned - even a real CA can't issue a spoofed certificate.  RHEV/vdsm would need be modified to support this - presumably by passing the certificate data and writing it to a tempfile, which would be passed to the fence agent.  When the cert is supplied, SSL_VERIFY_HOST can be turned off, otherwise the default CA bundle should be used with SSL_VERIFY_HOST on.  For those not wanting to pin a cert, they can enable the non-SSL webserver in UCS Manager for equivalent security.    (Personally I think that could work, but also an option of --insecure-ssl or something to disable those checks and default to them being on would work just as well).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:15:11 UTC  ``` The commit that introduced the problem:  <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/fence-agents.git/commit/?id=1ef8f0605ef021a7f0045d9be19497ef95a2a16e>  Or made the problem worse anyways.  We should have the cURL defaults set and override them to be insecure only when asked.  <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER> <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST>  So this:  fence-agents-4.0.2/fence/agents/cisco_ucs/fence_cisco_ucs.py:   c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0) fence-agents-4.0.2/fence/agents/cisco_ucs/fence_cisco_ucs.py:   c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0)  should probably be:  c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1) c.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2)  and then they should be dropped to 0 only when specifically asked, either via a commandline arg or a configuration option.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-28 21:18:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned [CVE-2014-0104](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0104).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-01 22:30:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Samuel for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 09:56:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c1)) > I've changed my mind on how to fix. I think the easiest fix would be to add > an option to pin a cert using CURLOPT_CAINFO (which takes a filename). This > way the cert is pinned - even a real CA can't issue a spoofed certificate.  Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.  (That's for curl + nss, may differ when curl uses different crypto backend.)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)  Marek Grac    2014-03-03 10:37:48 UTC  ``` I agree that this can be a possible security problem but we are not able to change that behaviour as it will make a regression. Running clusters will stop working. We can:  * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default)  IMHO the problem can be avoided when users follow documentation: "It is highly recommended to separate the private network for cluster heartbeat from the application network." On such network a MITM attacks are rare.   The other problem is that the majority of the fence devices accessible via https use only self-signed certificates.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c7)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-03 23:18:06 UTC  ``` I agree with the above.  While I would prefer to see an --insecure-ssl option for rhel5/6 instead of a --secure-ssl one (secure by default) I can see this being disruptive to many customers who are expecting and using it this one way.  I would however note the problems via documentation.  Unless someone really disagrees with that, I think that is entirely reasonable.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-04 07:59:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marek Grac from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)) > * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) > * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default)  Would it make sense to add both to all versions, and alias --ssl to one of them?  That can probably make transitions easier (e.g. users can change their configuration they use on RHEL-6 to use e.g. --insecure-ssl so the same configuration work with RHEL-7 too).  Option to specify CA certificate(s) probably makes sense too, so that updating system ca-bundle is not the only way to make secure ssl work with custom CA.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c11)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-04 08:07:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c10)) > (In reply to Marek Grac from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c6)) > > * add a new option --secure-ssl - for RHEL5/RHEL6 (insecure as default) > > * add a new option --insecure-ssl - for RHEL7 (secure as default) >  > Would it make sense to add both to all versions, and alias --ssl to one of > them?

Yes it sounds a very sensible approach to me.  Marek?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c12)  Marek Grac    2014-03-04 09:34:03 UTC  ``` If we want to fix that issue we will have to handle all fence agents which work over HTTPS. There are four of them according to <https://access.redhat.com/site/node/28603>  * fence_ilo for HP iLO1/iLO2 - based on gnutls-cli * fence_rhevm for RHEV-M - based on pycurl (REST API) * fence_cisco_ucs for Cisco UCS - based on pycurl (REST API) * fence_vmware_soap for VMWare vSphere - based on suds (SOAP API)  Adding support for --secure-ssl: * gnutls-cli backend: different command-line options  * pycurl backend: described above and on <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.htm> * suds backend: does not have direct support but there is a possible work-around described at <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6277027/suds-over-https-with-cert>  Option to specify a CA certificate is not a problem. I agree that we can do --ssl as an synonym for --(in)secure-ssl according to RHEL version.  The main problem that I can see is testing. We will need all mentioned machines with valid / valid (custom CA) / invalid (self-signed) certificates. There are quite a lot ilo2 machines, RHEV-M and VMWare should be easy to access, the only one which is hard to obtain is Cisco UCS. I had access to one in 2010, so I expect that it is still somewhere in Red Hat [contact person was Chris Wright]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c13)  Marek Grac    2014-03-04 13:30:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870423](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=diff "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870423&action=edit "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure") Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure  Patch that adds a support for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure.  It does not change situation for fence_vmware_soap because I found out that solutions are based on packages which are not available in rhel7. It is possible to do a little hack (until next minor release). We can check validity of certificate using pycurl (as in rhevm, cisco_ucs) and then use SOAP library as before. It means that verification will not be done in step but it will be done.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c18)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-04 20:16:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870617](attachment.cgi?id=870617&action=diff "New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870617&action=edit "New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap") New patch to fix logic for fence_cisco_ucs and fence_vmware_soap  The logic in setting was incorrect as --ssl-insecure would automatically imply --ssl and SSL_VERIFY* was never set to 0.

I suggest fixing the SOAP library.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c20)  Michael Samuel    2014-03-05 03:57:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)) > Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO > rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  > Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self > signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.

It also allows generating certificate requests for use with a CA.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c21)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-03-05 04:49:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Samuel from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c20)) > (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c5)) > > Assuming the above refers to passing server certificate as CURLOPT_CAINFO > > rather than CA certificate, this would not work in general either.  > > Verification fails if such certificate is not self signed, or if it is self > > signed with CA:FALSE basic constraint extension.

If you have access to a Cisco UCS in the house, we would very much like to have temporary access and test with a proper certificate. The one I used to unit testing in the fence-agents bug has only the self-signed certificate and we are not allowed to change it.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c22)  Marek Grac    2014-03-05 11:55:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 870924](attachment.cgi?id=870924&action=diff "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=870924&action=edit "Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)") Proposed patch for --ssl-secure and --ssl-insecure (including vmware soap fix)  Fabio's patch + fix for fence_vmware_soap (change of underlying transport library)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c23)  Michael Samuel    2014-03-11 22:20:59 UTC  ``` I discussed access with Fabio outside of BZ - it is no longer required.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c24)  Michael Samuel    2014-09-28 11:28:27 UTC  ``` Can we please unembargo this?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1071466#c25)  Vincent Danen    2014-10-10 15:12:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of fence-agent as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
