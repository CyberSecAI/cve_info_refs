How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : apt
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0478
Debian Bug     : 749795

Jakub Wilk discovered that APT, the high level package manager,
did not properly perform authentication checks for source packages
downloaded via "apt-get source". This only affects use cases where
source packages are downloaded via this command; it does not
affect regular Debian package installation and upgrading.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.

Package: apt
Version: 1.0.3
Severity: grave
Tags: security

I've been investigating how apt behaves when the repository doesn't
contain any Release signatures (possibly because they were stripped off
by a man-in-the-middle attacker).

This is what I found out:

| # cat /etc/apt/sources.list
| deb <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/> unstable main
| deb-src <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/> unstable main
|
| # apt-get update
| Ign <http://ftp.debian.org> unstable InRelease
| Ign <http://ftp.debian.org> unstable Release.gpg
| Get:1 <http://ftp.debian.org> unstable Release [205 kB]
| Get:2 <http://ftp.debian.org> unstable/main Sources [7249 kB]
| Get:3 <http://ftp.debian.org> unstable/main amd64 Packages [6758 kB]
| Fetched 14.2 MB in 29s (479 kB/s)
| Reading package lists... Done
|
| # echo $?
| 0

Hmm. There is no warning suggesting that anything fishy is going on, and
the exit code indicates success. (Perhaps the "Ign"s could raise
suspicion of an observant sysadmin. But who knows what "Ign" exactly
means? At least the apt-get(1) manpage doesn't know.)

Fortunately, apt-get won't let you install anything:

| # apt-get install -qq nyancat
| WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
|   nyancat
| E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes

And it won't let you even download binary packages:

| $ apt-get download nyancat
| WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
|   nyancat
| E: Some packages could not be authenticated

So far, so good. However, apt-get happily downloads unauthenticated
source packages, with no warning:

| $ apt-get source -d nyancat

| Reading state information... Done

It is equally happy to unpack them:

(personally, this feels a bit high. Mostly as deb-src isn't even part of
 many default configurations in which apt is found. And in those where
 you find it, you probably find also vcs checkouts and "wget | sh" …
 Anyway tl;dr: I wouldn't like to release jessie with it, so I leave it at
 that and we should ask the relevant security teams what they want, but
 I am too dreamy now to figure out a patch/all the mail addresses…)

Thanks! Not many do, so such things usually never get reported…
The pain of being even less sexy than OpenSSL…

(may I ask to push security bugs through the security teams first
 though, so that they can coordinate properly as 'apt' and 'security'
 tends to make people super nervous as recovery tends to be painful)

Well, "Ign" isn't "Get" - and it stands for "Ignore", but that is surely
not your point here.

The "problem" is that apt supports unsigned repositories as too many
people would bitch too much if it would require a signature – it used
to work before apt 0.6, it has to work forever, man – FOR EVER!

So not getting a signature isn't an error and not even fishy.
It's absolutely fine…

Maybe we could be "evil" and enforce the usage of the flag on update, too?

JFTR: --allow-unauthenticated is the flag littered all over the place to
let this error disappear. Similar to wget --no-check-certificate | sh.

Snipping the rest as if it downloads, everything else is just a follow
up. You see btw that dpkg-source (which does the unpack/build) would
check signatures on the dsc if it had them available. I think installing
debian-keyring would help (at least for packages from debian).

You will also notice that the check for the hashsum in the Sources, as
well as the check for the hashsum of Sources in Release is done, you
"just" don't get this lovely warning & error message for missing
signatures (aka: the MITM has to be a bit more active in modifying these
files as well to get away with sneaking bad files on your system).

The source (is this a pun now?) has no indication of ever wanting to
check this. Easy to add, for sure (CheckAuth method exists in various
versions in various places). Hardest part will be deciding if
a) sources should be interactive (needs a new string) OR
b) not just like e.g. 'download'.

I guess the later makes more sense (similar to download) and is more
backward compatible (not suddenly interactive), would therefore not
require a new string and should be simple(r) to backport if needed.
As this will surely find at least a few complainers for stable I will
repeat it though: This breaks (obviously) compatibility with unsigned
archives. Workaround for those buggers would be the flag from above.

Haven't written patch/testcase yet though, as I should be in dreamland
for a while now, so I could be horribly wrong about all this of course.

Not a lot of time tomorrow^Wtoday (and I can't upload anyway), so,
Michael, could you please have a look and talk to the security teams?

Best regards

David Kalnischkies

Thanks for your bugreport. You raise a important issue, but I agree
with David that its best if this goes through the security team for
coordination.

Right, I think apt should show a more prominent warning here. I will
look into this next.

As said, I don't think 'apt-get source' should be interactive, so this
true should be a false, right?

Reasons (as a repeat):
- it was not interactive before
- the error message on 'no' talks about install, so we would need a new
  string
- 'apt-get download' isn't interactive either
(- it is more in line with your own commit summary)

Counter arguments?

[..]

Good point! No counter arguments, the risk of breaking script by
prompting is indeed a good reason not to show the prompt (and we do
the same for download).

I changed it to non-interactive now.

reopen 749795

Hi.

I'm reopening this for now, even if the issue is solved from a technical
point of view (see below why).

In my opinion this is really some horrible bug... probably it could have
been very easily found by others, and we have no idea whether it was
exploited already or not.

Anyone who believed in getting trusted sources might have been attacked
with forged packages, and even the plain build of such package might
have undermined users' security integrity.

The same is the case with all debian build systems which probably rely
on secure APT.

So IMHO this bug definitely deserves a CVE and a DSA,... so that people
are informed that there systems might have been compromised (i.e. if an
attacker tricked them into using forged sources)... which is also why I
reopen it.

And do we need an investigation whether Debian an the Debian archives
themselves might have been intruded that way?

It's really saddening to see that such an issue could slip through,
especially when I've personally started already a few threads on
debian-devel about the security of secure APT.
The most recent one was IIRC:
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/03/msg00549.html>
but I've had one before, I think.

I think such bug shows that we can't just move on as we did till now...

From the APT perspective:

- Do we have unit checks now in APT, which basically test all commands
with unsigned repos, repos with invalid signature, packages where the
sums don't match the valid repo signatures, etc.?
We really should have this,.. and also check for things like expiry
dates.

- I also think that there should be one place of code that handles all
downloads of packages, so that we have some rock solid functions, which
do all the checks and verifications.

- I think per default APT should refuse to work with unsigned
repos/packages. One should really need some configuration switch or
option that allows this.
I don't think it's a big issue, since all the major repos are signed and
even the "end-user" tools to make own repos (like debarchiver) support
signing.
People should simply be taught to not use unsigned repos...

- That being said,... APT should always delete all cached files (repo
lists, signature files, Package and Source lists as well as downloaded
packages) as soon as a single verification error occurred at some place.
And since 3rd party programs or users may manually take stuff from
places like /var/lib/apt/lists or /var/cache/apt/archives... these
directories should contain a subdir like "unsecured/" where APT
downloads stuff to and only moves it out from there once all checks have
been passed.

- In case any even just remotely possible security issue occurs... apt
should exit with a non-zero status and not just a warning wich shell
scripts from users usually won't check for.

What about 3rd party programs and Debian in general:
There are still probably many programs which download stuff without any
verification,... or just warn which may be easily overseen:
- [c]debootstrap
I think they both default now to verify signatures (which is a good
thing)... but IIRC, debootstrap also defaults to not verify anything...
if the keyrings aren't installed - admittedly this is unlikely... but
possible... I've already had a discussion at the respective bug with
upstream, but nothing happened... I think such choices make it easily
happen for security critical situations to occur... completely
unnecessary.

- not really secure APT related: apt-listbugs
Not sure whether it uses https for getting bug infos... but since Debian
nowadays uses certs from GANDI, which we generally cannot trust,... this
is probably moot anyway.
Securely showing bugs, may be important for users, since they want to
now about bugs like "big security hole in package XYZ - don't install"

- apt-listchanges
Guess that uses local files an is therefore secure.

- apt-file
Last time I checked, the bug about not verifying the sums of the
Contents-* files was still open

- what about our build daemons and building tools like piuparts,
pbuilder, pbuilder-uml, debian-builder or qemubuilder
Do they use secure APT in ALL places? Is this constantly checked by some
unit tests?
Or are they easily tricked into using possibly insecure files, by
depending on exit statuses which are perhaps not != 0 in case of
security problems ... or by using files which were downloaded but not
removed when it was found out that they're insecure.

I think a package like e.g. pbuilder might easily operate insecurely...
it depends on [c]debootstrap for building... if debootstrap is used, but
debian-archive-keyring is not installed, then (IIRC) no signature
checking is done... in that case forged stuff may be downloaded,
chrooted into... and *bam* - already lost the game... and you don't even
need a hole like APT not checking files it gets with apt-get source.

Cheers,
Chris.

AAICS, #749795 talked about bringing this to the security team's
attention, but they never seem to have been CCed.

So the security team may not be aware that a security hole in apt was
recently fixed, that caused apt-get source to not give any indication
when the Release file was lacking a signature.

Whether it's closed in unstable or not, this bug is open still in
stable, and needs to get a CVE assigned, and a DSA issued.

A buildd (sbuild) or cowbuilder is set up using the normal debootstrap
process with --variant=buildd using the Debian archive keyring of the
host system to validate. (This works.) Then, /etc/apt/sources.list is
written, and APT defaults to secure. The debian-archive-keyring package
is Essential, so this is always installed during the bootstrap. Porters
add debian-ports-archive-keyring (debootstrap can do that).

The buildd-related software (and most people when doing manual builds
with cowbuilder) uses “apt-get source foo” to download the file, fully
assuming that apt-get ensures validation, so no “dscverify” is run on
the sources downloaded by apt. (If someone uses dget, either dget is
new enough to call dscverify, or they had better be doing that by hand.)

The build process inside the chroot of cowbuilder also calls dscverify,
but as debian-keyring (distinct from debian-archive-keyring) is never
installed, it errors out always, which is just ignored. (That being
said, when I was doing porter builds/uploads with cowbuilder and used
dget+dscverify to retrieve the source, even the debian-keyring package
in sid was sometimes not up-to-date enough to have the new keys the
maintainers used to sign their packages in it. Since the proper buildd
infrastructure does not use this but relies on SecureAPT to validate
the files it downloads, this is understandable.)

This means that, if there was ever a chance that 'apt-get source foo'
would not check the integrity of the files it downloaded against
Sources.gz + Release{,.gpg} we’re in pretty deep shit. (Well, there
was, before SecureAPT was enacted, but that’s outside of the scope
of this.)

Hi,

> apt: no authentication checks for source packages

The Debian security team has assigned [CVE-2014-0478](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0478) to this issue.

APT developers: we should fix this in wheezy. Are you able to provide an
update for wheezy for this issue?

As for squeeze, if it's not too much extra work it would be great if an
update for squeeze was also possible. Perhaps it could also even include
the fix for [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3634?](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3634)

Let us know.

Thanks,
Thijs

Yes, I will work on a backport for this today.

I look into this too, I don't know yet how much extra work it is.

Attached is the fix for wheezy with a regression test, a additional
test run is very welcome (works in my wheezy container both the
testcase and a manual test when removing /var/lib/apt/lists/*Release*).

Thanks! I've built it and verified that it works for me aswell (and solves
the issue). For the changelog: you need to target "wheezy-security", and
may want to add "closes: #749795" and urgency=high. With these changes you
can upload to security-master.debian.org. Make sure to build with full
source ("-sa") as wheezy-security doesn't yet have the orig tarball.

The patch seems to apply rather cleanly to squeeze, so an update for that
would be nice if possible. Fixing [CVE-2011-3634](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3634) aswell would be nice if
simple to do but not essential.

Cheers,
Thijs

Probably yes. Someone in the last ~11 years could have, but that nobody
did tells you a lot about how many people actively work on what so many
people seem to assume just has to work and complain loudly if it
doesn't in the way it always was (assumed to be)… so, to get anything
useful out of this: Should we do a kickstarter now or wait for
a libreapt fork?

Worst case. In practice you will have installed build-dependencies
before which has resulted in a error for those, which should have been
enough for you to recognise that something fishy goes on. It is at least
what all automatic builders will run into. Assuming of course you don't
ignore such errors which many users/scripts happily do…

Also, keep in mind that the chain is broken at the Release -> Sources
level, not at the Sources -> tarball level, so if you ship modified
tarballs to your target you have to also ship a modified Sources file.

For your attack to be (always) successful, you need a full-sources
mirror on which you modify all tarballs, so that you can build a valid
Sources file. You can't just build your attack tarball on demand as the
hash (and filesize) isn't going to match with what Sources declares.
(assuming you aren't good at pre-imaging, but then, why do you bother
with this one here?) Combine that with the problems of being a good MITM
in general and you might understand why my heart isn't bleeding that
much about this particular bug. We had worse and nobody really cared…

What is really sad is that many people keep talking about how much more
secure everything should be but don't do the smallest bit of work
to make it happen or even do a basic level of research themselves.

So instead of answering all your questions, I will instead leave them
unanswered and say: Go on and check for yourself! You shouldn't trust
a random guy like me anyway and if that leads to even one person
contributing to apt (or the security team or anything else really) in
this area, we have a phenomenal massive increase in manpower …
(for apt in the 50% ballpark!)

I will comment this one though: Michael wanted to look into this for
a while now. The plan I was suggesting was something like jessie:
support-unauth=true by default, jessie+1: support-unauth=false by
default, jessie+2: gone. We will see if this can be implemented at all.
Contributions welcome as always.

Think again. People do it all the time. It is the default mode of
operation for plugging in repos into builders for example. If you are
bored, just search for the usage of --allow-unauthenticated.

I half-jokingly mentioned with the plan last time that a bunker is
nearby, so I would be safe; half-jokingly as at least I got murder
threats for far less. I doubt it will be any different with this "not
big issue". So be careful with what you assume to be simple and
uncontroversial. See also xkcd#1172.

Some usecases can be transitioned to [trusted=yes] probably, but I am
not sure we really gain that much this way (as it makes things actually
worse from a security standpoint) so we really shouldn't press the
"security: don't care" crowd in this direction. Hence the slow ride-plan.

> People should simply be taught to not use unsigned repos...

Yeah. I will try my luck with world peace first though. Might be easier…
But I am a naive kid. 5 years ago I wondered why a small bug – which
even I could provide a patch for – wasn't fixed. Now I wonder how the
"team" manages to keep up with reading bugs at all; but its the same for
many other "Debian: native" packages. aka: It took me a while to
understand what "no upstream" really means …

chit-chat thread is just noise for them. Please don't pick up cc's at
random … If you want to /work/ on anything you could move to deity@ as
already suggested. Otherwise lets just talk here… (and no, you don't

[..]

I create a git branch that shows a warning if it comes accross a
unauthenticated repository:
"""
+   _error->Warning(_("The data from '%s' is not signed. All packages from "
+                     "that repository can not be authenticated."),
+                   MetaIndexURIDesc.c_str());
"""

I think for the future we actually should not allow a apt-get update
of untrusted repos without --allow-unauthenticated  or
[trusted=no]. But this will probably break some setups so we need to
be careful and not rush it.

Cheers,
 Michael

Also, "All" with a negated verb sounds awkward to me (but that may be
due to my non-native-englishness). How about:

"No packages from that repository can be authenticated."

or simply

"Packages from that repository cannot be authenticated."

?

Erm, no? You can just cache a working Sources file and exchange
the paragraph you are interested in. That’s something that would
be easy in a CGI written in shell, *and* perform well. Trivial.

And what about the setups, which assume secure data to be retrieved (as
far as I can see the whole build stack of Debian), which is already
broken now?

Security is much more critical here then things continuing to work... if
someone's setup really depend on not verifying integrity... he will
immediately notice (and can add the flag),... but no one notices if his
security is compromised by MitMs... :-(

So I see not much of a reason to not implement that right away.

Cheers,
Chris.

Absolutely, security is (much!) more important.

However with the fix that recently went into -security "apt-get source
foo" will fail if foo comes from a not-authenticated source. What I
wrote above is about not allowing "apt-get update" at all for unsigned
repositories (unless --allow-unauthenticated is used). But maybe you
are right and the warning that I added to git should be a error that
tells the user to use --allow-unauthenticated if he/she really wants
to use a repository that we can not authenticate.

Cheers,
 Michael

The "always" refers to the small problem that a MITM isn't in control of
what source package is acquired by the user later on. Modifying the
Source file is of course trivial, the hard part is making the
modification count given that at the time the request for the Sources
file is made you have no idea what (if any) source package the user will
request in 10 seconds/days following this 'apt-get update' (or
equivalent) – if the user isn't on to you given that you have thrown
away the signatures for binary packages, too, so that he can't even get
his build-dependencies without saying yes to a (default: no) warning.

From a theoretical standpoint, this is of course all negligible, but in
practice it's so annoying/fragile that way better alternatives exist.
(Me messing up InRelease parsing [twice] for example with ironically far
less coverage - its all about catchy titles I guess)

Best regards
