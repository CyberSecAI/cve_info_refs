[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0158)

## Topic

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.5.0 is now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
(API).

It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted the host name
from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in the oVirt REST API.
A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when
visited by a user with a valid REST API session, would allow the attacker
to trigger calls to the oVirt REST API. (CVE-2014-0151)

It was found that the oVirt web admin interface did not include the
HttpOnly flag when setting session IDs with the Set-Cookie header.
This flaw could make it is easier for a remote attacker to hijack an oVirt
web admin session by leveraging a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
(CVE-2014-0154)

The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
Product Security.

These updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages also
include numerous bug fixes and various enhancements. Space precludes
documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.5 Manager Release Notes document,
linked to in the References, for information on the most significant of
these changes.

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these
enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c0)  lzhuang    2014-03-18 03:02:17 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Because no protection against CSRF attack is performed in oVirt REST APIs(https://<host_ip>/api), an attacker could force an end user to execute unwanted actions to oVirt.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): oVirt 3.4.0-5 beta3  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Log in oVirt web application 2. Generate a malicious page that will send a request to oVirt REST API to delete a VM 3. Open that page in the same browser with oVirt  Actual results: A request is sent to oVirt REST API, and that VM is deleted.  Expected results: Prevention exists in all REST APIs, such as a CSRF token.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c1)  Juan Hernández    2014-03-18 13:10:22 UTC  ``` This is a real issue, but currently we can't implement a CSRF token solution without breaking the UI plugins, as they expect to be able to use the authentication and session created by webadmin, even when running from different machines.  Can we make this bug public?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c5)  Michael Pasternak    2014-04-17 08:46:26 UTC  ``` Hi Juan,  CSRF is an issue indeed, however i'm not sure that fix described in your patch [1] is a right way to go, as it not just breaks backward compatibility, but completely disables native authentication method (per request), which is common and expected in RESTful applications.  also forcing users explicitly mark theirs product as 'insecure' (just to continue working as they used to) does not seem right to me,  as about the fix itself, existence of Session & JSESSIONID header in request does not verify that the end-user intended to submit the request,   there are verity of options to deal with this, such as 'Checking The Referer Header', 'Double Submit Cookies ', 'Encrypted Token Pattern', 'Synchronizer Token Pattern', etc.  Thanks.  [1] <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/26578/2//COMMIT_MSG>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c6)  Juan Hernández    2014-04-21 10:55:17 UTC  ``` The proposed fix doesn't disable per request authentication. The check is only performed if the request contains the JSESSIONID cookie, and this cookie won't be contained if the caller is using per request authentication. These are the first few lines of the doFilter method:     // Nothing to check if there isn't a session yet:    HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);    if (session == null) {      chain.doFilter(request, response);      return;    }  The fix does break backwards compatibility, that I agree, but so will do any mechanism that requires new headers/parameters/cookies. In my opinion there is no way around that. And that is why we need a way to allow users, as a last resort, to mark their installation as insecure and thus continue using it. Note that the proposal is to let users do this in a fine grained way, so, for example, if a user has updated most of his RESTAPI callers, but still has a old application that can't be updated, he can just allow request from that particular application:    function isTrusted(request) {     // Check if the request is coming from the old application, using     // the source IP address, the user agent, or whatever it takes     // to detect that.     return ...;       }  The existence in the request of the JSESSIONID header with the same value that the JSESSIONID cookie demonstrates that the request comes from someone that was able to read the value of the JSESSIONID cookie or the JSESSIONID response header. In a browser that hasn't been compromised this means that only the application that received the original legitimate response. This is thanks to the "same origin policy" of the browser.  The proposal is in fact a variant of the "double submit cookies" technique.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c7)  Michael Pasternak    2014-04-26 11:29:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c6)) > The proposed fix doesn't disable per request authentication.

(btw the fact that you've addressed it in our clients, does not mean you sollved the issue this fix produces ...)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c8)  Vojtech Szocs    2014-04-28 16:57:19 UTC  ``` Hi guys, I would like to share some of my opinions on this topic.  > The existence in the request of the JSESSIONID header with the same value > that the JSESSIONID cookie demonstrates that the request comes from someone > that was able to read the value of the JSESSIONID cookie or the JSESSIONID > response header.  +1  In general, the use of cookies is the main source of CSRF vulnerability in web applications. Any kind of user credentials/identification (JSESSIONID cookie, HTTP Authorization header, etc.) that is *automatically* sent by the web browser as part of request essentially opens CSRF vulnerability.  In web applications, web browsers typically *remember* HTTP Basic Auth info once it has been set for given domain (unless you restart the browser) -- this means that also per-request authentication is implicitly subject to CSRF via HTTP Authorization header. I belive there should be a separate patch to address this. (On a side note, we should think about moving away from HTTP Basic Auth altogether, for security reasons.)  Similarly, web browsers automatically send cookies that were set for given domain (JSESSIONID cookie is typically marked as 'session' cookie which means it is deleted on browser restart). As Juan noted, only JavaScript that originated from domain X path Y can read cookie set for domain X path Y. In general, cookies are subject to *both* Same-Origin Policy (same domain) + same path check.  So if the client (JavaScript) is able to read JSESSIONID cookie (and send its value via JSESSIONID *request* header), we can assume that this client can be trusted. In addition to JSESSIONID cookie, REST API backend also sends JSESSIONID *response* header for clients that are on *same origin* but *different path* -- for example:  * WebAdmin GUI runs on <http://example/ovirt-engine/webadmin>   -> domain <http://example/>   -> path /ovirt-engine/webadmin  * REST API backend runs on <http://example/ovirt-engine/api>   -> domain <http://example/>   -> path /ovirt-engine/api  As you can see in example above, domains are the same, but paths are *not* the same, this is why having JSESSIONID *response* header is useful for JavaScript clients -- they normally wouldn't be able to read JSESSIONID cookie (due to same-domain + same-path restriction).  Regardless of how the client reads the JSESSIONID value (from cookie or from response header), the important thing is that the client needs to include JSESSIONID *request* header with this value -- this is something web browser won't do automatically, therefore it serves as CSRF request token.  > indeed, so if one uses per request authentication (does not ask for > persistent-auth and never got back JSESSIONID cookie in response from api, > can't send it in the following request to api) and as result all his > requests will be insecure (cause they does not have JSESSIONID http header),  In web browser, requests using per-request authentication will be vulnerable to CSRF anyway, because per-request authentication relies on HTTP Basic Auth -- as I mentioned above, web browsers typically remember Basic Auth info once it has been set for given domain (this is analogous to browsers automatically sending cookies for given domain once the cookie has been set).  As I wrote above, there should be patch to fix CSRF due to HTTP Basic Auth (per-request authentication scenario) as well.  I agree with Juan that there is no way to make CSRF-protection changes *and* stay compatible with old clients at the same time. It's simply because the current authentication mechanism (relying on HTTP Basic Auth and cookies) is vulnerable to CSRF on its own.   > anyway per-request auth will be broken after your patch for all clients, > cause they can't fulfill you request of supplying JSESSIONID header.  We should address CSRF for both per-request authentication (HTTP Authorization header) and persistent authentication (cookie) scenarios.  > i don't think this is a right approach, of course you can say it was insecure > before anyway, but my complain is not about being secure or not, but about a > need in doing something in order to be able continue working after this > patch, and this is a huge problem, >  > i think such changes should come in api-v2 and force api-v1 deprecation, but > not > breaking v1, it's simply not right.  This is a good point, but it would mean that api-v1 is vulnerable to CSRF whereas api-v2 contains CSRF protection. It's essentially a sacrifice of security in favor of backwards compatibility.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c9)  Michael Pasternak    2014-04-30 09:53:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to vszocs from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c8)) > > i don't think this is a right approach, of course you can say it was insecure > > before anyway, but my complain is not about being secure or not, but about a > > need in doing something in order to be able continue working after this > > patch, and this is a huge problem, > >  > > i think such changes should come in api-v2 and force api-v1 deprecation, but > > not > > breaking v1, it's simply not right. >  > This is a good point, but it would mean that api-v1 is vulnerable to CSRF > whereas api-v2 contains CSRF protection.

Callers that use non persistent authentication will work exactly as they used to.  Letting the consumers of the API decide is the reason for the existence of the trust script. The administrators of the engine can use it to decide, with a fine grained criteria. For example, an administrator may decide that he wants to require CSRF protection for requests coming for browsers, but not for requests coming from his curl scripts:    function isTrusted(request) {     return request.getHeader("User-Agent").startsWith("curl/");   }  Or he may decide to give their users one month to update their applications:    function isTrusted(request) {     var now = Date();     var limit = Date(2014, 06, 01);     return now < limit;   }  Or he may decide that he doesn't want to sacrifice compatibility at all:    function isTrusted(request) {     return false;   }  Of he may decide that security is paramount (this is the default):    function isTrusted(request) {     return true;   }  Or he may have any other criteria that we aren't aware of. The decision to when to sacrifice security in favor of compatibility is thus in the hands of the administrator, not in our hands.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c11)  Michael Pasternak    2014-05-01 10:44:09 UTC  ```  Juan,  (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c10)) > I have to insist that non persistent authentication isn't affected in any > way by this change, as when there isn't a session the filter does nothing. > Callers that use non persistent authentication will work exactly as they > used to.  you don't have to insist, but to explain yourself better in the description of the feature which is says at [1]:  FEATURE-DOC: "Currently we don't have any mechanism to protect the RESTAPI from CSRF attacks.

The decision to > when to sacrifice security in favor of compatibility is thus in the hands of > the administrator, not in our hands.  that's what i've told to begin with, but fixing things after it got broken using your workaround can't be call "choice" as it already stopped working ...  so after upgrading to latest build (including your change), they will have no choice whatsoever till administrator reads your documentation (let's assume he finds it ...) described here [1] understand what we're talking about / google it a bit, and maybe fix the env,  (don't assuming that all sysadmins on a same level of knowledge as you are, also sysadmins maybe not in position to decide if it should be trusted or not so they have to get developer/s involved while they may have used outsourcing to develop the app, etc., to make a long story short - it's a mess),  putting myself in position of product consumer, i'd be really frustrated dealing with this change without heads up,  thus i'm convinced this is a good change, but for api-v2.  [1]  FEATURE-DOC: "This change will break backwards compatibility with old callers, as they aren't aware of the new requirement. To handle that the filter uses a configurable script that decides if a request is trusted. Trusted requests don't need to use the JSESSIONID header. This script doesn't exist by default, so no request will be trusted by default. In order to use it the administrator will have to create it."  <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/26578/2//COMMIT_MSG>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c12)  Michael Pasternak    2014-05-01 13:33:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Pasternak from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c11)) > Juan, >  > (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c10)) > > I have to insist that non persistent authentication isn't affected in any > > way by this change, as when there isn't a session the filter does nothing. > > Callers that use non persistent authentication will work exactly as they > > used to. >  > you don't have to insist,   though looking at the code you indeed ignoring requests with no session, so i apologize for being lazy & not checking the code first, i think it worth mentioning that in the commit message/documentation btw,  anyway my point made at [comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c11) is still valid.  thanks.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c13)  Michael Pasternak    2014-05-03 15:47:38 UTC  ``` Juan,  i believe there is a way out, If you you want this feature in this version of api, you can push it, but make it disabled by default (so no clients will stop working), this way:  1. users can adapt to it 2.

The initial patch with an option to enable this feature would be shipped as an RHSA, with documentation explaining that manual configuration is necessary to apply the fix.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c15)  Juan Hernández    2014-07-07 20:01:41 UTC  ``` The CSRF protection filter has been reworked so that it is disabled by default. It can be enabled using the "CSRFProtection" configuration parameter:    # engine-config -s CSRFProtection=true  Then the engine needs to be restarted.  In addition the clients can decide to enable/disable protection using the "Prefer" header. If the first request of the session contains the "Prefer" header with the "csrf-protection" element then protection will be enabled, otherwise it will be disabled. This is intended for clients that don't need CSRF protection, as they don't run inside a browser (the SDKs and the CLI, in particular).  More details in the commit message of the change:    <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/29681>  The GUI applications do run in a browser, and I'm proposing to modify them so that they always send the "Prefer" header requesting protection:    <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/29682>  Note that once protection is enabled (with the CSRFProtection parameter) all UI plugins that use the session identifier passed by webadmin will need also to pass the session identifier in the "JSESSIONID" header.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c16)  Sven Kieske    2014-07-08 07:16:28 UTC  ``` Is there any chance to deprecate the old behaviour for UI-Plugins in some future version?  As far as I know there are not a heck of a lot UI plugins, couldn't those few devs get encouraged to adopt this new parameter?  What I am aiming for is a secure default installation.  The default installation has no plugins installed (correct my if I'm wrong).   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c17)  Juan Hernández    2014-07-08 09:56:32 UTC  ``` The default installation of oVirt doesn't have plugins installed, so you can perfectly change the CSRFParameter to true right after installation, if you want to have a more secure installation.  I have already notified the plugin developers I know. If the change is accepted we will notify other plugin developers.  For the future we plan to change the session tracking mechanism. Currently we use a JSSESSIONID cookie, which is problematic for JavaScript applications. In the future we want to use the JSESSIONID instead. This means that all client applications, including UI plugins, will have to send the JSESSIONID header. Once they do this change, they will be automatically supported by the CSRF protection mechanism. This will probably happen with oVirt 4.x, but there isn't a commitment yet.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c18)  Vojtech Szocs    2014-07-08 10:39:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c15))  > The GUI applications do run in a browser, and I'm proposing to modify them > so that they always send the "Prefer" header requesting protection:  +1  > Note that once protection is enabled (with the CSRFProtection parameter) all > UI plugins that use the session identifier passed by webadmin will need also > to pass the session identifier in the "JSESSIONID" header.  UI plugins that wish to integrate with Engine REST API will be encouraged to utilize oVirt.js library (which will take care of HTTP communication details).  More generally, UI plugins shouldn't make any assumptions about "CSRFProtection" config parameter value. If a UI plugin wishes to talk directly to Engine REST API (i.e. using XMLHttpRequest), it must take care of sending "JSESSIONID" request header on its own.

This is a *much* needed improvement, at least from UI (plugin) point of view.  @Juan, just out of curiosity, after we support "JSESSIONID" request/response header as an option for session tracking mechanism, can't we remove "Prefer:csrf-protection" and simply honor "CSRFProtection" config parameter?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c19)  Juan Hernández    2014-07-08 10:52:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to vszocs from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c18)) > @Juan, just out of curiosity, after we support "JSESSIONID" request/response > header as an option for session tracking mechanism, can't we remove > "Prefer:csrf-protection" and simply honor "CSRFProtection" config parameter?  We can remove "Prefer: csrf-protection" once that all clients are moved to use the JSESSIONID header instead of the cookie, but that will be a long time.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c20)  Vojtech Szocs    2014-07-08 11:14:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Juan Hernández from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1077441#c19)) > We can remove "Prefer: csrf-protection" once that all clients are moved to > use the JSESSIONID header instead of the cookie, but that will be a long > time.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
