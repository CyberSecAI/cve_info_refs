- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the presence of XML External Entity (XXE) processing within IBM Rational ClearQuest.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which occur when the application parses XML input from an untrusted source that includes references to external entities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (DoS) attacks or attacks on other servers accessible from the ClearQuest client or server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML data containing external entity references.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to submit XML input to the ClearQuest application. The specific mechanism for this isn't provided, but it would likely involve submitting malformed requests.
