# temporary file issue in flite

---

*From*: Murray McAllister <mmcallis () redhat com>

*Date*: Fri, 10 Jan 2014 01:01:41 +1100

---

```

As reported to the linux-distros mailing list:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
temporary file handling flaw in flite, a speech synthesis engine
(text-to-speech). A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a
symbolic link attack to modify an arbitrary file accessible to the user
running flite, or possibly obtain sensitive information as the temporary
file may contain text-to-speech output (screen contents). (CVE-2014-0027)

The issue is here:

src/audio/auserver.c contains:

static int play_wave_from_socket(snd_header *header,int audiostream)
{
…
fff = cst_fopen("/tmp/awb.wav",CST_OPEN_WRITE|CST_OPEN_BINARY);
…
n = audio_write(audio_device,shorts,q);
cst_fwrite(fff,shorts,2,q);

```
As this is debugging functionality and never read by flite, the fix is
just to ifdef the lines out...
```

```
A patch is available from
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1048678>
```

Cheers,

--
Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1048678#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-01-06 05:45:19 UTC  ``` It was found that flite, a speech synthesis engine (text-to-speech), insecurely used a temporary file. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to modify an arbitrary file accessible to the user running flite, or possibly obtain sensitive information as the temporary file may contain text-to-speech output (screen contents).  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1048678#c6)  Rui Matos    2014-01-06 14:24:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 846118](attachment.cgi?id=846118&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=846118&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1048678#c11)  Murray McAllister    2014-01-09 13:57:27 UTC  ```  Created flite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1050997](show_bug.cgi?id=1050997 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0027 flite: insecure temporary file use [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1050998](show_bug.cgi?id=1050998 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0027 flite: insecure temporary file use [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1048678#c12)  Huzaifa S.
