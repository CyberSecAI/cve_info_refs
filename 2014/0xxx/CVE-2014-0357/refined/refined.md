Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AMTELCO miSecureMessages Server Release 6.2 performs weak authentication for access to user messages. It uses the contact identifier and a valid license key for authentication of client app XML requests. The contact identifier is easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** The system uses a trivially guessable contact identifier along with a license key to authenticate user message requests. This is insufficient for secure authentication.
*   Insufficient session management, allowing modification of message requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can read users' messages by iterating through contact identifier values. This can expose personally identifiable information.
*   An attacker could potentially receive message traffic between healthcare providers and patients.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote network attack, by sending crafted XML requests with guessed contact identifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the request structure and have access to a valid license key (present on a licensed client app).
*   The attacker would need moderate skill to craft the exploit.

**Additional details:**

*   The vendor was initially difficult to contact, leading to a quicker than usual public disclosure by CERT/CC.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in miSecureMessages Server Release 6.3.
*   Exploits for this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.
*   The vulnerability allows a valid user to retrieve sensitive message contents and expose personally identifiable information of other users due to insufficient session management

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Base Score:** 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
*   **Temporal Score:** 5.6 (E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C)
