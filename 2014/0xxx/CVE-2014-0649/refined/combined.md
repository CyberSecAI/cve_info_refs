| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 8.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 0.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 0.0 |

All releases of Cisco Secure ACS prior to ACS 5.4 patch 3 are affected by the OS command injection vulnerability in this advisory.    Use the following methods to determine the version of Cisco Secure ACS that is running:    + From the Cisco Secure ACS command-line interface (CLI), issue the     **show version** command, as shown in the following     example: ```     acs51a/admin# show version          Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 1.2     ADE-OS Build Version: 1.2.0.152     ADE-OS System Architecture: i386          Copyright (c) 2005-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.     All rights reserved.     Hostname: acs51a               Version information of installed applications     ---------------------------------------------                Cisco ACS VERSION INFORMATION     -----------------------------     Version : 5.1.0.44.6     Internal Build ID : B.2347     Patches :      5-1-0-44-3     5-1-0-44-6          acs51a/admin#     ```   + On the main login page of the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface,     the version information is displayed on the left side of the screen.   + From the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface, log in and click the     **About** link at the top right corner of the screen. Cisco Secure ACS version 5.1 will identify itself as version   **5.1.0.44**, Cisco Secure ACS version 5.2 will identify   itself as version **5.2.0.26** and Cisco Secure ACS version 5.3 will identify   itself as version **5.3.0.40**. The presence of an additional   digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For   example, a version number of **5.1.0.44.3** indicates Cisco Secure   ACS version 5.1 with up to patch 3 installed. The absence of any additional   digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version with no   patches installed. The example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.1 Patch 6.       Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following Cisco Secure Access Control Server products are not affected by this vulnerabilities:   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server View   + Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution EngineNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * A core component of the Cisco TrustSec solution, Cisco Secure ACS is a highly sophisticated policy platform providing RADIUS and TACACS+ services. It supports the increasingly complex policies needed to meet today's new demands for access control management and compliance. Cisco Secure ACS provides central management of access policies for device administration and wireless, wired 802.1x, and remote VPN network access scenarios. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credential information stored in an internal database. With an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.      **Cisco Secure ACS RMI Privilege Escalation Vulernability**      A vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform actions as superadmin.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface using an authenticated user account. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform superadmin functions via RMI.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud75180](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75180) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0649.         **Cisco Secure ACS RMI Unauthenticated User Access Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the ACS via the RMI interface.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication and authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the ACS and perform administrative actions.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud75187](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75187) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0648.         The RMI interface transports data over TCP port 2020 and TCP port 2030. The RMI interface is utilized for communication between Cisco ACS nodes in a distributed deployment environment.         **Cisco Secure ACS Operating System Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject operating system-level commands.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a specific location of the ACS web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform operating system-level commands without shell access, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue65962](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue65962) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0650.
