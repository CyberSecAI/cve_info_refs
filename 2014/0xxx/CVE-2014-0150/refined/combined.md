Package        : qemu-kvm
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0150

Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the
way qemu processed MAC addresses table update requests from the guest.

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt qemu process
memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
execution on the host with the privileges of the qemu process.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.

## Details

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled vmxnet3

devices. A local guest could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-4544](/security/CVE-2013-4544))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled virtio-net

MAC addresses. A local guest could possibly use this issue to cause a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host.

([CVE-2014-0150](/security/CVE-2014-0150))

Benoît Canet discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled SMART self-tests. A

local guest could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code on the host. ([CVE-2014-2894](/security/CVE-2014-2894))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-20 11:59:49 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way qemu processed MAC addresses table update requests from the guest.  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt qemu process memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the qemu process.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-20 12:07:33 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does affect the qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future qemu-kvm updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:00:16 UTC  ``` Upstream patch submission:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.qemu/266713>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:01:50 UTC  ```  Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1086776](show_bug.cgi?id=1086776 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0150 xen: qemu: virtio-net: buffer overflow in virtio_net_handle_mac() function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c6)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 13:01:54 UTC  ```  Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1086775](show_bug.cgi?id=1086775 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0150 qemu: virtio-net: buffer overflow in virtio_net_handle_mac() function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-22 17:41:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2014:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0421.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-22 17:42:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0420 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0420.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-24 17:37:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0435 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0435.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-24 17:38:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack 4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2014:0434 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0434.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1078846#c14)  Fedora Update System    2014-05-01 22:27:08 UTC  ``` qemu-1.6.2-4.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
