Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `auth_token` middleware of `python-keystoneclient` when used with memcached as a token cache, specifically when running under `eventlet` without proper monkey-patching of the `thread` module. The interaction between `eventlet` and `python-memcached` is problematic and causes context confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Context Confusion:** The primary weakness is that under high load, the `auth_token` middleware can return a cached token associated with a different user than the one who made the request. This occurs due to the race condition when retrieving tokens from `memcached`.
*   **Lack of Thread Patching:** The issue only arises if the process running the middleware uses `eventlet` without monkey-patching the `thread` module. Proper monkey patching of `thread`, `threading` and `Queue` is required to avoid the race condition.
*   **Reliance on Memcached**: The use of memcached for token caching in combination with `eventlet` without proper `thread` patching is a pre-requisite for this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user can potentially assume the identity and authorization of another user, including administrative users. This allows an attacker to gain access to resources they should not have.
*   **Multi-tenant Authorization Bypass**: An attacker can bypass multi-tenant restrictions by assuming a different tenantâ€™s context.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** The vulnerability can lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources and data depending on the compromised identity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Repeated Requests:** The attacker needs to send repeated authenticated requests to a service that uses `auth_token` middleware with memcached enabled.
*   **High Load:** The race condition is triggered more frequently under high load.
*   **Eventlet without thread monkey-patching**: The target service needs to be using `eventlet` without patching of thread, threading and Queue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the service.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a service protected by the vulnerable `auth_token` middleware.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of `python-keystoneclient` up to 0.6.0
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a problematic interaction between the python-memcached library and eventlet, when thread support is not properly monkey-patched.
*   The fix involves both patching `python-keystoneclient` and ensuring services using `eventlet` and `auth_token` middleware also monkey-patch `thread` .
*   The issue was originally reported by Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne.

The content also provides additional context on the fix process, including discussion on the need to patch the affected services. It is worth noting that Red Hat classifies this vulnerability as "Important" because it can easily compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources.
