- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "LABEL_ID" parameter in the "adminui/user_list.php" page of the Dell KACE K1000 management appliance is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `LABEL_ID` parameter within the `adminui/user_list.php` page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary script into the web page, allowing them to execute it within the context of the end-user's browser session. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP request targeting the vulnerable "adminui/user_list.php" page and injecting malicious JavaScript into the "LABEL_ID" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote. They need the ability to send HTTP requests to the KACE K1000 appliance.
