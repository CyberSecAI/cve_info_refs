## Dell KACE K1000 management appliance contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#813382

Original Release Date: 2014-02-04 | Last Revised: 2014-02-11

---

### Overview

Dell KACE K1000 management appliance version 5.5.90545, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. ([CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))

### Description

| Dell KACE K1000 management appliance version 5.5.90545, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The "LABEL\_ID" parameter in the "adminui/user\_list.php" page is vulnerable.  Proof-of-Concept:hxxp://ip\_KACE/adminui/user\_list.php?SEARCH\_SELECTION=&LABEL\_ID=aaas"><script>alert("XSS");</script>&&PAGE=2 |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Dell has provided [this response](http://www.kace.com/support/resources/kb/solutiondetail?sol=SOL120154) to the vulnerability. Also, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
