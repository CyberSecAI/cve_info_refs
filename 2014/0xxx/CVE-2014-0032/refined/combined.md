Subversion, also known as svn, is a version control system much like

 the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Version control systems allow

 many individuals (who may be distributed geographically) to

 collaborate on a set of files (typically source code). Subversion has

 all the major features of CVS, plus certain new features that CVS

 users often wish they had.

 .

 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), tools to create a

 Subversion repository (svnadmin) and to make a repository available

 over a network (svnserve).

  \* svn\_apply\_autoprops: Apply property settings from

    .subversion/config file to an existing repository

  \* svn\_load\_dirs: Sophisticated replacement for 'svn import'

  \* svn2cl: Generate GNU-style changelog from repository history

  \* svnmerge: Maintain merge history between two related branches

    (mostly obsolete as of Subversion 1.5)

  \* svnwrap: Set umask to 002 before calling svn or svnserve

  \* several example hook scripts: commit-access-control, commit-email,

    log-police, mailer, svnperms, verify-po

 .

 NOTE that some of these scripts are unsupported by upstream, and may

 change radically or disappear in future releases. The Recommended

 packages are each required by at least one of these scripts.

# USN-2316-1: Subversion vulnerabilities

14 August 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Subversion.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [subversion](/security/cves?package=subversion) - Advanced version control system

## Details

Lieven Govaerts discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module

incorrectly handled certain request methods when SVNListParentPath was

enabled. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0032](/security/CVE-2014-0032))

Ben Reser discovered that Subversion did not correctly validate SSL

certificates containing wildcards. A remote attacker could exploit this to

perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. ([CVE-2014-3522](/security/CVE-2014-3522))

Bert Huijben discovered that Subversion did not properly handle cached

credentials. A malicious server could possibly use this issue to obtain

credentials cached for a different server. ([CVE-2014-3528](/security/CVE-2014-3528))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libsvn1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1)
* [subversion](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libapache2-svn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)
* [libsvn1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)
* [subversion](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Topic

Updated subversion packages that fix three security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
mod\_dav\_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access to
Subversion repositories via HTTP.

A flaw was found in the way the mod\_dav\_svn module handled OPTIONS
requests. A remote attacker with read access to an SVN repository served
via HTTP could use this flaw to cause the httpd process that handled such a
request to crash. (CVE-2014-0032)

A flaw was found in the way Subversion handled file names with newline
characters when the FSFS repository format was used. An attacker with
commit access to an SVN repository could corrupt a revision by committing a
specially crafted file. (CVE-2013-1968)

A flaw was found in the way the svnserve tool of Subversion handled remote
client network connections. An attacker with read access to an SVN
repository served via svnserve could use this flaw to cause the svnserve
daemon to exit, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-2112)

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart the httpd
daemon, if you are using mod\_dav\_svn, and the svnserve daemon, if you are
serving Subversion repositories via the svn:// protocol.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_76f00dc1_20250126_075939.html ===
 Subversion svnserve servers up to 1.7.9 (inclusive) are vulnerable
to a remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability.
Summary:
========
Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP connection
is closed early in the connection process.
This can lead to disruption for users of the server.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion servers through 1.7.9 (inclusive).
Subversion servers through 1.6.21 (inclusive).
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.10
Subversion 1.6.23
Subversion 1.8.0
mod\_dav\_svn (any version) is not vulnerable.
Details:
========
During a connection attempt svnserve improperly treats aborted connections
as critical errors, prints an error message and exits. The error message
will look like this:
svnserve: E000053: Can't accept client connection: Software caused connection abort
The problem is that svnserve is not properly checking for aborted connection
error returns from the accept() call.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. An exploit exists and
has been tested to work against this vulnerability. We do not believe the
exploit is being actively used in the wild at this time.
A remote attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
of the server. The attack does not require that the attacker authenticate.
Due to differences in implementations of their TCP stacks some operating
systems may be more or less prone to this behavior. FreeBSD and OpenBSD are
known to be particularly vulnerable. We believe that this is still possible
with all operating systems though.
svnserve when used in inetd, tunnel (svn+ssh), and Win32 service modes is
not vulnerable as they do not use the accept() call in question.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
Using svnserve in inetd, tunnel or Win32 service modes can be used to
mitigate this problem. There are no known methods to mitigate this attack
in daemon mode.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/0.35.0
NOTICES:
1. As of this release, Subversion once again does deltification
automatically. This means that the deltification step most
repositories introduced into their post-commit hooks as of
release 0.33.0 should now be reverted. Look for a line with
"svnadmin deltify" in hooks/post-commit, and remove it.
2. We now recommend using Berkeley DB 4.2.52 or higher for SVN
repositories. See http://sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml.
User-visible changes:
\* BDB log files are automatically pruned, with BDB 4.2.50 and higher (#1615)
\* deltification is automatic again (issue #1601)

Version 0.35.0 (branching 12 December 2003, from revision 7994)
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/0.35.0
NOTICES:
1. As of this release, Subversion once again does deltification
automatically. This means that the deltification step most
repositories introduced into their post-commit hooks as of
release 0.33.0 should now be reverted. Look for a line with
"svnadmin deltify" in hooks/post-commit, and remove it.
2. We now recommend using Berkeley DB 4.2.52 or higher for SVN
repositories. See http://sleepycat.com/download/index.shtml.
User-visible changes:
\* BDB log files are automatically pruned, with BDB 4.2.50 and higher (#1615)
\* deltification is automatic again (issue #1601)
\* fix: svn diff -rX:Y wcpath' may lie (issue #1616)
\* fix: URI-decoding problem on 'svn import' (issue #1622)
\* many other enhancements, minor features, and bugfixes not listed here
Developer-visible changes:
\* misc. improvements on Perl and Java bindings
\* improved diff handling (r7985)
\* many other changes not listed here

# Subversion, Serf: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201610-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Subversion and Serf,
the worst of which could lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-vcs/subversion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.4**revision > **1.8.16** |

| Package | **net-libs/serf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.7** |

### Background

Subversion is a version control system intended to eventually replace
CVS. Like CVS, it has an optional client-server architecture (where the
server can be an Apache server running mod\_svn, or an ssh program as in
CVS’s :ext: method). In addition to supporting the features found in
CVS, Subversion also provides support for moving and copying files and
directories.

The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Subversion and Serf.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, obtain
sensitive information, or cause a Denial of Service Condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-vcs/subversion-1.9.4"

```

All Serf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/serf-1.3.7"

```

 mod\_dav\_svn is vunerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS vulnerability
when SVNListParentPath is on.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it
receives an OPTIONS request against the server root and Subversion is
configured to handle the server root and SVNListParentPath is on.
This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this
problem being exploited in the wild, but the details of how to exploit
it have been disclosed on the Subversion development mailing list.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.3.0 through 1.7.14 (inclusive)
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.5 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.15 (not publicly released)
Subversion 1.7.16
Subversion 1.8.6-1.8.7 (not publicly released)
Subversion 1.8.8
svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable
Details:
========
When Subversion is configured on the root path of the server and the
SVNListParentPath directive is set to on then the following commands
will trigger a segfault:
svn list http://svn.example.com/
svn lock http://svn.example.com/
This occurs because when mod\_dav\_svn attempts to calculate the parent
path of the request is ends up setting a NULL pointer (since there can be
no parent of the server root URI), which is later assumed to be valid memory.
When Subversion is configured on any Location other than "/" (e.g. "/svn")
then the problem does not occur since the parent of the path can be
calculated and stored in memory.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.3
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Repositories which
allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.
However, we believe the required configuration is relatively rare. Most
systems are not hosting Subversion on the root path of the server and
only a small number of those have the SVNListParentPath configuration on.
A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache
servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
on other clients being served by the same process that services the
OPTIONS request from the attacker. In either case there is an increased
processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process
caches being lost.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.8. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
Administrators that wish to protect against this without patching
immediately can apply the following configuration to their httpd.conf
file:
[[[
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all

]]]
CAUTION: The above configuration should only be used when Subversion is
enabled on the root location in a parent path configuration. For example the
following is the minimal configuration that matches this case:
[[

DAV svn
SVNParentPath /var/svn

]]
In this case it will not block any useful requests and can be used without
concern that it will break anything. If Subversion is running on any other
path or is not being used in a parent path configuration this configuration
should not be applied as these configurations are not vulnerable and it can
break functionality of Subversion or other applications being served from the
same httpd.

 Subversion FSFS repositories can be corrupted by newline characters in
filenames
Summary:
========
If a filename which contains a newline character (ASCII 0x0a) is
committed to a repository using the FSFS format, the resulting
revision is corrupt.
This can lead to disruption for users of the repository.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion servers through 1.7.9 (inclusive).
Subversion servers through 1.6.21 (inclusive).
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.10
Subversion 1.6.23
Subversion 1.8.0
Details:
========
The FSFS repository stores data for each revision in a revision file.
Filename data in the revision file is stored on a line-per-line basis.
If a filename itself contains a newline character (ASCII 0x0a), this
newline is incorrectly treated as a line separator, rather than as
part of the filename.
Affected revisions cannot be read correctly and cause some Subversion
commands to fail. Known symptoms of the problem include:
1) 'svnadmin verify' is known to fail with errors beginning with:
"svnadmin: E160013: File not found:"
2) 'svnsync' fails to replicate the revision.
Apache Subversion clients have always rejected such filenames, so this
issue cannot be triggered with stock Subversion clients. It could,
however, be triggered by custom malicious Subversion clients or by
third-party client implementations.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.9
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Configurations which
allow anonymous write access to the repository will be vulnerable to this
without authentication.
A remote authenticated attacker with commit access may be able to corrupt
repositories on a Subversion server and cause disruption for other users.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
A workaround is to install the control-chars.py hook script as the
pre-commit hook, which will prevent bad filenames from entering the
repository. The script is available at this URL:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/hook-scripts/control-chars.py
