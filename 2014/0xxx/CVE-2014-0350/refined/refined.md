Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0350:

**1. Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions "CVE IDs: [CVE-2014-0350](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0350)" and also states "The POCO C++ Libraries NetSSL library fails to properly validate wildcard certificates", which matches the vulnerability described in the provided CVE.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause is the reliance on DNS reverse mapping for validating wildcard certificates. Specifically, the `Poco::Net::X509Certificate::verify()` method in the POCO C++ Libraries NetSSL library uses DNS to obtain aliases for the hostname. These aliases are then used for matching against the wildcard domain names in the certificate. If DNS reverse mapping is broken (e.g., due to a DNS spoofing attack), the validation fails.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper validation of wildcard certificates.
- Dependency on DNS reverse lookups for a security-critical action.
- Vulnerability to DNS spoofing attacks that can lead to malicious certificate validation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can perform a DNS spoofing attack.
- This can trick an SSL/TLS client into trusting a malicious server's certificate, provided that the certificate chain validation is successful.
- This could potentially enable man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept and potentially modify encrypted communications between a client and a server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based attacks through DNS spoofing.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence DNS resolution.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to perform a DNS spoofing attack.
- No other specific privileges or capabilities are required on the victim's machine.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects stable release versions 1.4.6p2 and older, as well as development release versions 1.50 to 1.5.2.
- The fix involves updating to version 1.4.6p4 or later, where reverse DNS lookups for certificate hostname validation are no longer used.
- The change log from 1.4.6p4 states: "- no longer use reverse DNS lookups for cert hostname validation".
- The CVE description is short but the provided content provides additional details about the root cause, affected versions and the solution.
