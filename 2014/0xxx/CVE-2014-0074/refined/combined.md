A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the application server running the application that uses Xalan-Java. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-06-08 02:32:11 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c0)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:12:16 UTC  ``` It was found that the Xalan-Java secure processing feature imposes insufficient constraints:  * Java properties, bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property(), are accessible.  * Output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources are allowed.  * Arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is in the classpath, as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure processing disabled, effectively bypassing the intended protection.  A remote attacker who is able to provide XSL that will be processed by Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the constraints of the secure processing feature. Depending on the components available on the classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the application server running the application that uses Xalan-Java.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c1)  David Jorm    2014-03-25 03:37:34 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2435>  Upstream patch commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1581058>  External References:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-002.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-01 17:51:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0348 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0348.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1080248#c6)  Fedora Update System    2014-04-05 04:53:34 UTC  ``` xalan-j2-2.7.1-22.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

#### Description

Here below is how my active directory setup looks like in shiro.ini:

ldapContextFactory = org.apache.shiro.realm.ldap.JndiLdapContextFactory

ldapContextFactory.url = ldap://abc.internal:389/

adRealm = org.apache.shiro.realm.activedirectory.ActiveDirectoryRealm

adRealm.ldapContextFactory = $ldapContextFactory

adRealm.searchBase = "CN=Configuration,DC=abc,DC=internal"

Servlet Code:

Subject subject = SecurityUtils.getSubject();

String username = request.getParameter("uid");

String password = request.getParameter("pwd");

String rememberMe = request.getParameter("rememberMe");

Boolean flag = false;

if (rememberMe != null && rememberMe.equalsIgnoreCase("on")) {

flag = true;

}

if (!subject.isAuthenticated()) {

logger.info("Authenticating user: " + request.getParameter("uid"));

UsernamePasswordToken token = new UsernamePasswordToken(username, password, flag);

try

{
subject.login(token);
}

catch (UnknownAccountException e)

{
logger.info("Unknown user account...");
}

catch (IncorrectCredentialsException e)

{
logger.info("Incorrect credentials...");
}

catch (DisabledAccountException e)

{
logger.info("User account disabled...");
}

catch (AuthenticationException e)

{
logger.info("Authentication Exception...");
}

Actions performed in login.jsp,

1. With empty username and password field => authentication succeeds - This should not happen

2. With empty username and some random password => authentication succeeds - This should not happen

3. With non-existent username and some password => authentication fails - This is correct

4. With existing username and invalid password => authentication fails - This is correct

5. With correct username and password => authentication succeeds - This is correct.

Please let me know if you were able to reproduce this issue in your environment and what other information would you need.

FYI, The Ldap and Jdbc Realms are working fine except for the ActiveDirectory realm.

Thank You

# [Announce] Apache Shiro 1.2.3 Released - Security Advisory

---

*From*: Brian Demers <brian.demers () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 3 Mar 2014 10:14:52 -0500

---

```
Dear Apache Shiro Community,

The Apache Shiro team has released Apache Shiro version 1.2.3. This is the
third bug fix point release after 1.2.0.

All binaries (.jars) are available in Maven Central already.

This release includes 1 critical vulnerability and is available for
Download [1] now.
 SHIRO-460 - LDAP authentication succeeds even if the user name and
password is not passed. [2] [CVE-2014-0074]

Versions Affected:
1.0.0-incubating - 1.2.2

Details:
When using an LDAP server that allows unauthenticated bind, Shiro will
authenticate users with an empty password.
NOTE: this is NOT the default for OpenLDAP

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to 1.2.3

Workaround:
Disable unauthenticated binds on your LDAP server (best practice).

Cheers,

The Apache Shiro Team

[1] <http://shiro.apache.org/download.html>
[2] <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-460>

# RHSA-2014:1351 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.1.0 Rollup Patch 1, which addresses several
security issues, multiple bug fixes, and adds various enhancements, is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
6.1.0. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the
readme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security
issues are addressed in this release:

It was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying
a user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end
that allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of
Apache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as
valid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain
access to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.
(CVE-2014-0034)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error
messages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted request which, when processed by an application using
Apache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,
possibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)

It was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache
CXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed
by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk
space, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)

It was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web
page that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.
(CVE-2014-0168)

It was found that the Spring Framework did not, by default, disable the
resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration when processing
user-provided XML documents. By observing differences in response times, an
attacker could identify valid IP addresses on the internal network with
functioning web servers. (CVE-2014-0225)

It was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache
CXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name
and password used by the client application using Apache CXF.
(CVE-2014-0035)

A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-0193)

Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
installation instructions.

Red Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the
CVE-2014-0193 issue.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
security update.
