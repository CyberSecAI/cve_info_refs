- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the "node_id" parameter in the URL is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CWE-79.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session, potentially leading to account hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `node_id` parameter
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the affected web application. No specific privileges or authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
