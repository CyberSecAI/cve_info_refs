Original Release Date: 2014-02-11 | Last Revised: 2015-09-17

---

### Overview

DELL SonicWALL GMS/Analyzer/UMA version 7.1, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. ([CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))

### Description

| **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**  DELL SonicWALL GMS/Analyzer/UMA version 7.1 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The "node\_id" parameter on the page "/sgms/mainPage?page=genNetwork&screenid=1002&manager=ScreenDisplayManager&level=1&node\_id" is vulnerable.Proof-of-Concept:hxxps://{SONICWALL}/sgms/mainPage?page=genNetwork&screenid=1002&manager=ScreenDisplayManager&level=1&node\_id=aaaaa"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>&screenid=1002&unused=&help\_url=&node\_name=Instance View&unitType=1&searchBySonicwall=0 |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Dell SonicWall [has released version 7.1 SP2 or 7.2](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/shared/download/Support_Bulletin_GMS_Vulnerability_XSS_Resolved_in_7.1_SP2_and_7.2.pdf) to address this vulnerability. If you are unable to upgrade, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
