## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Topic

Updated cfme packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs, and
add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a
model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.
Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

The SSH utility script created a world-writable file in /tmp/ using a
predictable name, and then executed it as root. A local attacker could use
this flaw to execute arbitrary commands as the root user. (CVE-2014-3486)

A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled
wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary local files accessible to a Ruby
on Rails application using the aforementioned routes via a specially
crafted request. (CVE-2014-0130)

The root password of newly-deployed systems was logged to evm.log, allowing
attackers with local user accounts on the CloudForms Management Engine
server to gain root access to newly-deployed systems. (CVE-2014-0184)

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way CloudForms
Management Engine escaped JavaScript elements in certain views. An attacker
could construct a carefully crafted URL, which once visited by an
unsuspecting user, could cause the user's web browser to execute a
malicious script in the context of the CloudForms Management Engine domain.
(CVE-2014-0176)

It was found that the wait\_for\_task() function of CloudForms Management
Engine could, under certain circumstances, enter an infinite loop. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to repeatedly call wait\_for\_task(), which
would cause an excessive amount of CPU resources to be consumed on the
system running CloudForms Management Engine, resulting in a denial of
service. (CVE-2014-0180)

CloudForms Management Engine used a default salt value to protect stored
passwords; however, as the salt value was known, this did not provide
additional protection. This made it easier for local attackers with access
to the stored passwords to perform brute-force attacks and recover the
plain text versions of the passwords. (CVE-2014-3489)

The CVE-2014-0176 issue was discovered by Martin Povolny of Red Hat, the
CVE-2014-0180 issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product
Security Team and CVE-2014-3486 issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of
the Red Hat Product Security Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the dashboard widget regeneration could fail with

an error status for users who were members of multiple LDAP groups.
The Widget.get\_group method has been updated to work with both a group ID
and a description, and the timing out of active and queued miq\_tasks has
been fixed. Dashboard widgets now regenerate correctly. (BZ#1089673)

* When CloudForms Management Engine failed to check the current region for

a user, the dashboard widgets would display no data for that user.
With this update, region checking has been fixed and all widgets in the
dashboard display correctly. (BZ#1090577)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* In order to read storage reports more easily, a new feature has been

implemented for snapshot sizes to be available as suffixed bytes (B, KB,
MB, GB), similar to other disk-related columns (for example the total
provisioned space and disk capacity). (BZ#1089036)

All users of Red Hat CloudForms 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
