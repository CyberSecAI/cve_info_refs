  "CVE-2014-0005": {
    "description": "It was identified that PicketBox/JBossSX allowed any deployed application to alter or read the underlying application server configuration and state without any authorization checks. An attacker able to deploy applications could use this flaw to circumvent security constraints applied to other applications deployed on the same system, disclose privileged information, and in certain cases allow arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "PicketBox/JBossSX did not perform authorization checks when allowing deployed applications to interact with the underlying application server's configuration and state.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass security constraints of other applications, disclose sensitive information, and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Deployment of malicious applications on vulnerable servers."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to deploy applications to the vulnerable server."
  }
