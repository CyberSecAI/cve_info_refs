The provided content relates to CVE-2014-0023.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OpenShift install script uses a predictable temporary file location (`/tmp`) for storing and extracting installation files, leading to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable temporary file creation in `/tmp`.
- Lack of verification that the extraction of files overwrites existing content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution as the user installing OpenShift.
- Arbitrary file overwrites.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with local access to a system where the OpenShift installer will be run can create or modify files within the `/tmp` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access to the system where OpenShift will be installed.
- Ability to create or modify files in `/tmp` before the OpenShift installer is executed by an administrator.
