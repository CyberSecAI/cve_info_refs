Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection issue found in the GDS (Global Data Synchronization) component of IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition and IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product Information Management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** This type of SQL injection occurs when an attacker cannot directly see the results of their injected SQL queries. Instead, they infer the results based on the application's behavior, such as response times or error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially steal sensitive data from the database. The exact data and impact are not specified but could include user credentials, product information, or any other data stored in the affected database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the GDS component of the affected IBM software. The specific entry point within this component is not detailed, but it is related to how the application processes SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable GDS component. The attacker would need network access to the system running the vulnerable application, though specific authentication requirements are not specified.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition Versions 11.3, 11.0, 10.1, and 10.0 (GDS component only).
- IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product Information Management Versions 9.1 and 9.0 (GDS component only).

**Remediation:**
- IBM recommends applying specific fixes to address the vulnerability:
    - For IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition 11.0, apply 11.0-FP5.
    - For IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition 10.1/10.0, contact IBM Customer Support.
    - For IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product Information Management 11.3, apply 11.3-IF002.
    - For IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product Information Management 9.1/9.0, contact IBM Customer Support.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no known workarounds or mitigations other than applying the fixes.
- The CVSS score is environment-specific and should be evaluated by users.
- The provided content is more detailed than the initial CVE description.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to use blind SQL injection to steal data from vulnerable IBM InfoSphere products, affecting specific versions of the Collaborative Edition and Product Information Management Server.
