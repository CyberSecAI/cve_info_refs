The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS14-012) that describes multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, including CVE-2014-0297.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue. When Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, it can corrupt the memory in such a way that an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage. An attacker can host a malicious website or inject malicious content into compromised websites or advertisements. The attacker then needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page. This can be achieved through social engineering techniques like sending malicious links in emails or instant messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious content and convince the victim to visit that website. The attacker also needs to have the expertise to create the specially crafted webpage that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
