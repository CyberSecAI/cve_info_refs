Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) incorrectly handling group membership expansion when a non-POSIX group is encountered in the group membership chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Group Membership Expansion:** SSSD stops processing group memberships when it encounters a non-POSIX group.
- **Incomplete Group Membership:** Due to the above issue, users are not recognized as members of POSIX groups that appear after a non-POSIX group in the chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unintended Access:** If a user is a member of a POSIX group that is present in a "deny" ACL, but the user's membership was not properly expanded due to a non-POSIX group, the user could bypass the "deny" ACL and gain unintended access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This could potentially lead to users gaining access to resources or systems that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need a user account that has group memberships that include both POSIX and non-POSIX groups, configured in such a way that the non-POSIX group appears before a POSIX group that is used in access controls.
- The system running SSSD needs to be configured to use both POSIX and non-POSIX groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would not necessarily need elevated privileges to exploit this, but simply a user account that has group memberships structured in a specific way.
- An understanding of the system's group membership structure and access control rules would be beneficial to exploit this fully.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a "low" severity.
- The issue was fixed in SSSD version 1.11.7.
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and was addressed in updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
