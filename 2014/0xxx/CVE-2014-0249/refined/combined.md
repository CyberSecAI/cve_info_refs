| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1101751#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 20:21:59 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that SSSD improperly expanded group membership when it encountered a non-POSIX group in the group membership chain.  For instance:    user -> posix_group1 -> non_posix_group -> posix_group2  With the group memberships noted above, SSSD should include the user as a member of both posix_group1 and posix_group2, however due to the position of the non-POSIX group, SSSD halts processing at it and never reaches posix_group2, leaving the user as a member of posix_group1 and not posix_group2.  SSSD has the capability to set a 'deny' ACL for both users and groups, so in a situation like that illustrated above, if posix_group2 was present in a 'deny' ACL, the user would be granted access because they are not shown as having membership in the denied group.  This could grant unintended access to certain users in an environment where non-POSIX groups are used in addition to POSIX groups.  There is currently no patch to correct this issue.   [1] <https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/sssd-devel/2014-May/019495.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1101751#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-27 20:22:25 UTC  ```  Created sssd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1101756](show_bug.cgi?id=1101756 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-0249 sssd: incorrect expansion of group membership when encountering a non-POSIX group [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1101751#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-05-29 07:45:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the version of sssd package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having Low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1101751#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-06 11:48:47 UTC  ``` Upstream bug: <https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/2343>  Fixed upstream in version 1.11.7: <https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/wiki/Releases/Notes-1.11.7>  Upstream commits: <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/commit/?id=0b6b4b7669b46d3d0b0ebefbc0e1621965444717> <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/commit/?id=4da27d52078497c5c095f4a4cd9975fe5c83c330> <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/sssd.git/commit/?id=191d7f7ce3de10d9e19eaa0a6ab3319bcd4ca95d>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1101751#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-12 14:35:57 UTC  ``` This issue was already fixed in sssd updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (in 6.6, via RHBA-2014:1375) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (in 7.1, via RHBA-2015:0441).  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-1375.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-0441.html>   ``` |  |
