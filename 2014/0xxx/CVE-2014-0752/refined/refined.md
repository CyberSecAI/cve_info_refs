Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Ecava IntegraXor does not properly restrict access to files within the project directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control on files in the project directory. This allows an attacker to bypass normal security mechanisms.
- **Information Disclosure:** Due to the lack of access controls, sensitive project files, such as backups, can be downloaded by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to potentially sensitive files in the project directory. This information could include configuration details, passwords, or other critical data.
- **System Compromise:** Access to project files can allow attackers to gain deeper knowledge of the system, which may lead to further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that points to the desired file in the project directory.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill:** The content indicates that a low-skilled attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system, as the attack vector involves using a crafted URL. No authentication is needed to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-529: Exposure of Access Control List Files to an Unauthorized Control Sphere.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 7.5, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P), indicating network-based attack vector, low complexity, no authentication required with partial impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The vendor, Ecava Sdn Bhd, has released a patch for this vulnerability (IntegraXor SCADA Server 4.1.4369).
