        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.",
        "attackVector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability through Internet Explorer. Alternatively, compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content could also be used to deliver the malicious content. The attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by tricking them into clicking a link.",
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website and trick a user into visiting it. Exploitation does not require any user interaction beyond visiting the malicious page."
