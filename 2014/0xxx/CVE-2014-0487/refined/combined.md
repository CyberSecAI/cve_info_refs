Package        : apt
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0487 CVE-2014-0488 CVE-2014-0489 CVE-2014-0490

It was discovered that APT, the high level package manager, does not
properly invalidate unauthenticated data (CVE-2014-0488), performs
incorrect verification of 304 replies (CVE-2014-0487), does not perform
the checksum check when the Acquire::GzipIndexes option is used
(CVE-2014-0489) and does not properly perform validation for binary
packages downloaded by the apt-get download command (CVE-2014-0490).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.9.

We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2348-1: APT vulnerabilities

16 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in APT.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [apt](/security/cves?package=apt) - Advanced front-end for dpkg

## Details

It was discovered that APT did not re-verify downloaded files when the

If-Modified-Since wasn't met. ([CVE-2014-0487](/security/CVE-2014-0487))

It was discovered that APT did not invalidate repository data when it

switched from an unauthenticated to an authenticated state. ([CVE-2014-0488](/security/CVE-2014-0488))

It was discovered that the APT Acquire::GzipIndexes option caused APT to

skip checksum validation. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and was not enabled by default. ([CVE-2014-0489](/security/CVE-2014-0489))

It was discovered that APT did not correctly validate signatures when

manually downloading packages using the download command. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0490](/security/CVE-2014-0490))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [1.0.1ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/1.0.1ubuntu2.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.19](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.19)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.7.25.3ubuntu9.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.25.3ubuntu9.16)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
