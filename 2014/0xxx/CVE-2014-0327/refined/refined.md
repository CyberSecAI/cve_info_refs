- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Iridium Pilot and OpenPort terminals use an insecure proprietary communications protocol that lacks authentication for critical functions. Specifically, the firmware upgrade process does not require authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical functions (CWE-306) which allows unauthenticated access to the firmware upgrade functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device by performing a malicious firmware update.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can connect to the device remotely on TCP port 54321 to initiate a firmware upgrade.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the device. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, over the network.
