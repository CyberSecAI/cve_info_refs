- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CIMPLICITY Web-based access component, CimWebServer, does not check the location of shell files being loaded into the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22). The vulnerability lies in the improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could send shell code to the CimWebServer, which would deploy malicious files as part of any SCADA project, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via sending malicious shell code to the CimWebServer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the CimWebServer. The advisory notes that moderate skill is needed to exploit.
