Introducing Lord Tuskington

● Chief Financial Pinniped for TuskCorp

● Presenter at Kiwicon 2012

● Used again in a panicked response to a request for

media attribution after Ruxcon 2014

● Goal: get major vendor to credit a stuffed walrus
for reporting a code exec flaw. No luck so far :(

SSL issues

● Lord T has the skinny if you're interested:

http://lordtuskington.blogspot.com/2014/10/cyanog
enmod-mitm-flaw.html

SSL issues

● “The Most Dangerous Code in the World: Validating

SSL Certificates in Non-Browser Software”
(Georgiev, M. et. al., 2012)

● No server hostname verification in a number of

clients: commons-httpclient, axis, many proprietary
clients including Chase internet banking app

● Hostname verification added to commons-

httpclient, but flawed not once (CVE-2012-6153)
but twice (CVE-2014-3577)

SSL issues: CVE-2014-3577

● Vulnerable CN extraction code:

● Use of comma as part of the subject attribute value
could confuse the tokenizer and attempt to match
a "CN=" string in the middle of some other
attribute value. For example:

O="foo,CN=www.apache.org"

SSL issues: CVE-2014-3577

● Exploitation relies on tricking a CA into signing such

a cert, but this has been proven by Facebook
engineers who found CVE-2014-3577

● Patched CN extraction code:

SSL issues: Cyanogenmod

●

android_external_apache-http/src/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java

● Challenge: find another instance of the vulnerable
code, or a variant of it, in an open source project

Authentication bypasses

● Logic errors in security constraints

● Incorrect paths, path wildcards

● HTTP verb/method tampering: security constraints

restricted to specific verbs/methods

● HEAD method used for tampering. RFC2616:

 “In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other
than retrieval”

“The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT

return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained
in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical
to the information sent in response to a GET request.”

CVE-2014-0121

● Hawt.io project includes a web-based admin

terminal: http://localhost:8181/hawtio/hawtio-karaf-
terminal/term

● CVE-2014-0120: CSRF

● AuthenticationFilter.java

CVE-2014-0121

● Remote unauthenticated command execution

● Live demo

● Patch for AuthenticationFilter.java:

● Full patch commit:

https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/commit/5289715
e4f2657562fdddcbad830a30969b96e1e

CVE-2010-0738

● JMX Console allows management of Java beans

● HtmlAdaptor servlet has a default security

constraint:

● Tomcat/JbossWeb executes the doGet() servlet

handler to handle HEAD requests (Content-Length)

CVE-2010-0738

● Many exploits in the wild, including the Jboss Worm.

Metasploit example:  http://www.exploit-
db.com/exploits/16319/

● Also works when there is no security constraint at
all, which is the case for Jboss AS 4.x/5.x upstream

● Lesson: always include default authn/authz

JMX Console: lesson learnt?

● CVE-2012-0874

The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow

unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. Due to the second
layer of authentication provided by the security interceptor, there is no
way to directly exploit this flaw. If a user misconfigured the security
interceptor or inadvertently disabled it, this flaw would be exploitable. A
remote attacker could exploit this flaw to invoke MBean methods and run
arbitrary code in the context of the user running the JBoss server.

● CVE-2013-4810 (rgod, ZDI)

The HP ProCurve Manager (PCM) was found to expose unauthenticated

JMXInvokerServlet and EJBInvokerServlet interfaces. A remote attacker
could exploit this flaw to invoke MBean methods and run arbitrary code in
the context of the user running the PCM server.

Unauthenticated auth

● RFC4513 (LDAP)

“An LDAP client may use the unauthenticated authentication
mechanism of the simple Bind method to establish an
anonymous authorization state by sending a Bind request
with a name value (a distinguished name in LDAP string
form [RFC4514] of non-zero length) and specifying the
simple authentication choice containing a password value of
zero length."

“Operational experience shows that clients can (and
frequently do) misuse the unauthenticated authentication
mechanism of the simple Bind method (see Section 5.1.2).
For example, a client program might make a decision to
grant access to non-directory information on the basis of
successfully completing a Bind operation."

Unauthenticated auth

● CVE-2012-5629: JBoss AS

● CVE-2014-0074: Apache Shiro

● CVE-2014-3612: Apache ActiveMQ

● Etc. etc.

XXE (everywhere!)

● General entity attacks

● Parameter entity attacks

● Most Java APIs do not disable entity expansion by

default

● Relies on developers following best practices, e.g.

from OWASP

OWASP XXE guidelines

 It wasn’t always this way:

XXE: CVE-2014-3490

● RESTEasy REST API framework:
It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external
parameter entities were not disabled when the
resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false. A
remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use
this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server,
and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.

● Used by many apps, e.g. oVirt:

● test.dtd on the attacker server:

XXE: CVE-2014-3490

● Patch is simply to use the updated advice from the

OWASP guide:

XXE: XXEBugFind

● https://github.com/ssexxe/XXEBugFind

● Uses soot to parse compiled Java bytecode and

then run it through an analysis and rules engine.
Rules for anti-patterns that identify XXE are defined
in XML.

● Existing rules have some flaws, but the architecture

is rock-solid

● Example flaw I found using XXEBugFind, in a code
base I never read, never understood, and never
wrote a line of code for:

https://www.playframework.com/security/vulnerability
/CVE-2014-3630-XmlExternalEntity

Cmd parameter injection

● When a single command string is input to
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(), the string is
tokenized and split into the command and
parameters

● Direct injection of commands is not possible

● The attacker still has complete control over the

parameters, how can that be abused?

● Example: OpenSSL

Apache Ambari (no CVE)

● First reported Sep 2014, still not patched

● The certificate signing REST API does not require
authentication. It passes user-supplied input to
CertificateManager.signAgentCrt:

https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-
server/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/server/security/unsecur
ed/rest/CertificateSign.java#L63

● The agentHostname value is derived from user-

supplied input, and is then directly concatenated
into shell commands calling openssl:

https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-
server/src/main/java/org/apache/ambari/server/security/Certifica
teManager.java#L207-219

RCE – XSL extensions

● Various XSL libraries allow embedding code in

stylesheets via extensions

● Xalan and Saxon allow embedding Java. Xalan allows

this by default, unless explicitly disabled.

● Even then, there are workarounds:

● You can find many other instances of this issue

RCE – XSL extensions

● Example exploit using Java extensions:

RCE – XSL extensions

● How can an attacker supply XSL?

● Camel-xslt transforms: http://camel.apache.org/xslt

● Attackers can provide an XML document, but what

about the XSL file?

● CamelXsltFileName message header (accepts

URLs)

● Live demo: CVE-2014-0003

RCE – XSL extensions

● Ektron CMS, user-supplied XSL without

authentication (CVE-2012-5357)

● Liferay, XSL portlets (CVE-2011-1571)

● SpagoBI, report presentation view (CVE-2014-7296)

● Apache Solr, in combination with a directory

traversal flaw (CVE-2013-6397)

● Many more to be found. Remember, the app only
has to fail to configure Xalan correctly, OR use an
outdated vulnerable Xalan JAR.

Path traversal

● Basic premise: path either consists of or ends in

user-supplied input

● Input can include “../” to make a relative path
absolute, and access any file accessible to the
process running on the server:

● Poison null byte injection can terminate the path,
allowing the latter case to be exploitable on older
unpatched JDKs

● Encode or double encode, e.g. %2e%2e%2f

CVE-2014-7816

“It was discovered that Undertow, when running on
Microsoft Windows, is vulnerable to a directory
traversal flaw. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to read arbitrary files that are accessible to the
user running the Java process.”

Why only Windows?

CVE-2014-8114

● Uberfire: information disclosure and RCE via

insecure file upload/download servlets

● RCE by uploading: cmd.jsp

● RCE by downloading?

● Credentials stored on disk

● username=HEX( MD5( username ':' realm ':'

password))

● Do I need to bother demoing that this is easy to

crack?

RCE – EL interpolation

● Various expression languages are commonly used

in Java libraries

● MVEL is one example

● Generally speaking, if an attacker can supply EL,
they can execute arbitrary code on the server

● How can an attacker supply EL?

RCE – EL interpolation

● Zanata is an open source translation memory

platform built on Seam

● Seam evaluates EL in log messages. If code

performs string concatenation with user-supplied
input to create the log messages, an attacker can
inject EL (Credit: Adrian Hayes)

● Zanata would log user-supplied strings using string

concatenation

EL: CVE-2014-3120

● Elasticsearch enables MVEL embedded in search

queries by default

● This is a feature, and the environment is meant to

be protected

● In many cases, of course, it is not

● Example: JBoss Fuse:

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1191453

● Live demo

● CVE-2015-1427: sandboxing attempted, blocking
class, getClass(), etc. Pointless, this for example
still works...

EL: Example exploit

Spring EL

● Can be used in a variety of settings, but is not

designed to be user-supplied

● <spring:eval expression="${param.pwn}" />

(new
java.util.Scanner((T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntim
e().exec("cat
/etc/passwd").getInputStream()),"UTF-
8")).useDelimiter("\\A").next()

RCE – binary deserialization

● Java contains a native serialization mechanism,

that converts objects to binary data

● When deserializing, the readObject() and

readResolve() methods of the class will be called

● This can lead to vulnerabilities if a class on the

classpath has something exploitable in
readObject() or readResolve()

● How can an attacker provide binary serialized

objects?

RCE – binary deserialization

● Serialization is used as a format for transferring

objects over networks, e.g. via REST APIs

● Example #1: RichFaces state (CVE-2013-2165,

Takeshi Terada, MBSD)

● Example #2: Restlet REST framework (CVE-2013-

4271)

● Live demo: CVE-2013-4271 PoC

● What kind of issue could exist in

readResolve()/readObject() that would be
exploitable?

commons-fileupload

● Component to simplify file uploads in Java apps

● DiskFileItem class implements readObject()

● The readObject method creates a tmp file on disk:
tempFile = new File(tempDir, tempFileName);

–

● tempDir is read from the repository private attribute
of the class, exposing a poison null byte flaw (file-
writing code is native, now patched)

● An attacker can provide a serialized instance of DFI

with a null-terminated full path value for the
repository attribute: /path/to/file.txt\0

● commons-fileupload code embedded in Tomcat

Restlet + DFI

● Upload a JSP shell to achieve RCE

● Solution #1: don't deserialize untrusted content

● Solution #2: don't introduce flaws in

readObject()/readResolve()

● Solution #3: type checking with look-ahead

deserialization (Pierre Ernst):
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/se
-lookahead/index.html

● More information:

https://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/11/20/java-
deserialization-flaws-part-1-binary-deserialization/

RCE – XML deserialization

● Alternative XML-based serialization formats

● JAXB is the standard (no known flaws)

● Other XML serialization libraries exist, and have

exposed security issues leading to RCE

● We’ll look at two examples: XMLDecoder and

XStream

XMLDecoder

● XMLDecoder’s XML format can represent a series of
methods that will be called to reconstruct an object

● If XMLDecoder is used to deserialize untrusted

input, arbitrary code can be injected into the XML

● Example: Restlet CVE-2013-4221. Fixed by

removing vulnerable functionality.

XStream

● Reflection-based deserialization

● Has a special handler for dynamic proxies

(implementations of interfaces)

● Attackers can provide XML representing a dynamic
proxy class, which implements the interface of a
class the application might expect

● Dynamic proxy implements an EventHandler that
calls arbitrary code when any members of the
deserialized class are called

● Vulnerable components: Spring OXM, Sonatype

Nexus, Jenkins

XStream in Jenkins

● Jenkins XML API uses XStream to deserialize input

● Access to XML API -> RCE (but not such a huge

deal)

● Live demo: Jenkins

● Solution: blocked DynamicProxyConverter in

XStream wrapper class

● Upstream solution: whitelisting, with dynamic

proxies excluded by default

● More information:

https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/01/23/java-
deserialization-flaws-part-2-xml-deserialization/

Dozer XML ↔ Binary Mapper

● Uses reflection-based approach to type conversion

● Used by e.g. Apache Camel to map types

● If used to map user-supplied objects, then an

attacker can provide a dynamic proxy

● There must either be an object being mapped to with
a getter/setter method that matches a method in an
interface on the server classpath, or a manual XML
mapping that allows an attacker to force the issue.

● Proxy must be serializable (implements Serializable)

● EventHandler is not

Dozer CVE-2014-9515

● Wouter Coekaerts reported a serializable

InvocationHandler in older versions of Spring: CVE-
2011-2894

● Using Alvaro Munoz's CVE-2011-2894 exploit, I was
able to develop a working Dozer exploit. It is only
exploitable if all the aforementioned conditions are
met, and vuln Spring JARs are on the classpath

● Live demo: Dozer RCE

(https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/resea
rch/tree/master/dozer-rce)

● Reported upstream since Dec 2014, no response:
https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/217

Other InvocationHandlers

● Any common component is useful, but in the JDK

itself means universally exploitable

● Three other InvocationHandlers in Java 7/8:
● CompositeDataInvocationHandler

● MbeanServerInvocationHandler

● RemoteObjectInvocationHandler

● CompositeDataInvocationHandler: forwards getter
methods to a CompositeData instance. No use.

MBeanServerInvocationHandler

● Proxy to an MBean on the server. Potentially useful,
e.g. if MBeans used by JBoss Worm are present.

● Problem 1: attacker must specify correct JMX URL

● Solution 1: JMX is exposed locally on port 1099

● Solution 2: Brute force JMX URL via Java PID

● Problem 2: attacker cannot control code that is run

for any method call, on specific method calls

● EventHandler exploits work no matter which

method is invoked on the proxy object.
MBeanServerInvocationHandler simply calls the
method of the same name on the MBean.

RemoteObjectInvocationHandler

● Proxy to a remote object exported via RMI

● Problem 1: attacker must know details of a remote

object exported to the server

● Solution: JMX registry is exposed via RMI. If JMX
is exposed locally on port 1099, the attacker
could craft an object instance that points to the
JMX RMI URL

● Problem 2: attacker cannot control code that is run

for any method call, on specific method calls

● Future work: look for more potentially exploitable

InvocationHandlers

How to find novel flaws

● Pick a language or platform and go deep

● Understand all the language or platform specific

issues that have been found before

● Synthesize this knowledge with creative thinking

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1072716#c0)  Trevor Jay    2014-03-05 05:18:24 UTC  ``` hawtio-karaf-terminal does not apply any authentication or authorization constraints by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to run commands in the Karaf terminal, and therefore execute arbitrary code in the context of the Karaf server process.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1072716#c1)  Trevor Jay    2014-03-05 05:52:27 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1072716#c2)  David Jorm    2014-03-06 10:01:03 UTC  ``` Upstream patch commits:  <https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/commit/5289715e4f2657562fdddcbad830a30969b96e1e> <https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/commit/bedbba03dd971d481a6852ccdaec670a9665e94b>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1072716#c5)  Chess Hazlett    2014-04-14 18:43:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue only affects Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 Beta. It is resolved in the general availability release of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0. Earlier versions of Red Hat JBoss Fuse are not affected, as they did not include the hawtio-karaf-terminal component.   ``` |  |
