{
  "CVE-2014-0144": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Root cause": "Missing input validation in QEMU block drivers for CLOOP, QCOW2 version 2 and various other image formats",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation",
        "Integer overflow",
        "Buffer overflow",
        "Logic error"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "Attack vector": "An attacker modifies a disk image file loaded by a guest.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to modify disk image files loaded by a QEMU guest."
