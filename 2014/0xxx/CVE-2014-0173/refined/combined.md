# Jetpack 2.9.3: Critical Security Update

Updated on August 26, 2014 - George Stephanis

Jetpack version 2.9.3 contains a critical security update, and you should update your site and any you help manage as soon as possible. You can update through your dashboard, or [download Jetpack manually here](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.9.3.zip).

During an internal security audit, we found a bug that allows an attacker to bypass a site’s access controls and publish posts. This vulnerability could be combined with other attacks to escalate access. This bug has existed since Jetpack 1.9, released in October 2012.

Fortunately, we have no evidence of this being used in the wild. However, now that this update is public, it’s just a matter of time before exploits occur. To avoid a breach, you should update your site as soon as possible. (The vulnerability has been disclosed on the MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system as CVE-2014-0173.)

This is a bad bug, and Jetpack is one of the most widely used plugins in the WordPress world. We have been working closely with the WordPress security team, which has pushed updates to every version of the plugin since 1.9 through core’s auto-update system. We have also coordinated with a number of hosts and network providers to install network-wide blocks to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability, but the only sure fix is updating the plugin.

Over the next few hours, we will reach out to individuals whose sites are still running an insecure version. Sites that don’t update may be disconnected from the Jetpack service for their own security, and will be able to reconnect as soon as their version of Jetpack is updated.

If you host a large number of Jetpack-powered blogs, please leave your contact information in the comments so we can be in touch in the future. We have prepared and shipped point releases for all eleven vulnerable branches of the Jetpack codebase: [1.9.4](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.1.9.4.zip), [2.0.6](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.0.6.zip), [2.1.4](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.1.4.zip), [2.2.7](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.2.7.zip), [2.3.7](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.3.7.zip), [2.4.4](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.4.4.zip), [2.5.2](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.5.2.zip), [2.6.3](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.6.3.zip), [2.7.2](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.7.2.zip), [2.8.2](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.8.2.zip), and [2.9.3](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jetpack.2.9.3.zip). If you can force these upgrades for your hosted users, it will prevent their sites from being compromised.

Finding and fixing bugs is a key part of software development. I can’t promise there will never be another issue like this, but I can promise that when a problem is found we will do everything in our power to protect as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. We care deeply about each and every WordPress user.

       from the paragraph above there is a very real implication that 2.9.3 is vulnerable as well. This is a souce of confusion … at least for me.

       Read it! Think about it ! Tell us what you think!

     You can simple do a manual update if you are not sure. I would deactivate and delete the old version, then install the latest version (which includes the update) from the Jectpack site or WordPress.org.

     You need to go to Plugins/Installed Plugins. Scroll down to see your Jetpack installation. On the right at the bottom you should see what version you are running. If this is not 2.9.3 (the latest version) then you’ll see a notification below saying, “There is a new version of Jetpack..” and giving a link on the right of that to Update now. Just click on this and you’ll be updated to 2.9.3.

     You can’t update from the Jetpack link at the top of the dashboard where you set up your modules, which is probably causing the confusion. You have to update from Plugins/Installed Plugins/Jetpack.

     Hope this helps.

    As a software/web developer myself, and with the recent heartbleed vulnerability causing mass-hysteria, most of us know and understand that security issues can be found in any software at any time.

    What I must admire, is the exceptional way in which the Jetpack and WordPress teams have handled this situation. It’s great to see that such dedication goes into the security of a product, and that the end users are kept so well informed!

    IMHO, This makes a perfect case-study on handing security vulnerabilities “the right way”.

    We passed on the level of customer care that you give us to our own customers, rolling out the update on both our own WordPress networks (containing a total of 21 sites) and our numerous client’s standalone sites as quickly as physically possible.

    Great work guys,

    I received an email that security vulnerability with the version of Jetpack active on my site. I actually cannot see it anymore on my site, but if I try to upload a new version of Jetpack: 2.9.3,it tells me that it’s already installed. It’s not in my plug in or on my dashboard. Help!

    Do I need to first uninstall my current version of Jetpack 2.2.5, and then install a clean version of 2.9.3? I don’t see any other way. I see no prompts for an update to Jetpack whatsoever.

    Having to completely uninstall it and then install a clean version runs counter to how I understand WordPress plugins are supposed to work. Am I missing something?

    When I go to upload the latest version that I downloaded via Jetpack’s notification emails for all my sites, it won’t install because it won’t overwrite the existing Jetpack directory on the server.

    Thoughts?

    Thanks for the fast notification. Wish the upgrade was a little cleaner, though.

      If you have FTP access, you can just overwrite the old plugin with the new that way. Alternately, deleting and reinstalling an up to date version will work, but you may need to enable/disable a few modules if the preferences get affected.

      If you’ve updated to a patched version of the plugin, Jetpack should work properly and the vulnerability is fixed.

      But you can of course take measures to make the rest of your WordPress site secure, as explained here:

      What version of WordPress are you on? You may need to update core first, to have the updater run as expected. We’ve just made a change for the older security releases, so you may be able to update them as-is — but we would still strongly encourage you to update core to current.

        3.6.1, and updating core is non-trivial in this case.

        I’ve removed the 2.0.2 plugins/jetpack and replaced it with 2.0.6. I did not deactivate first, the plugin says it is now 2.0.6, and I was not asked to reconnect with wordpress.com. Am I good for now? Anything missed?

    Hi George,

    The wording of this update notice is a bit confusing. It sez there are eleven vulnerable branches, then goes on to list them with v2.9.3 in the vulnerable group.

    Then elsewhere in your comments you state that 2.9.3 is OK and NOT vulnerable. So perhaps there are only 10 vulnerable branches, or is there a 2.9.3.x un-shown version update.

    Perhaps to save support time and traffic the notice could be rewritten to clarify the above.

    Also, if it is a hidden 2.9.3.x update, is there a way (certain file version or date stamp) that would reveal the situation.

    And, how does all this fit in with the new WP policy of doing back end security updates without user intervention.

    thanks for the catch and quick posting to hosts…. great work!

    bc

All of my sites have 2.9.3 version when I checked them. So, from my understanding with the emails/messages, 2.9.3 has a major bug and I have to update (re-update?) it to the same version?

    Hello, Just so I am clear on what you are saying here, Am I correct in thinking that as long as the Jetpack I am running is 2.9.3 that is safe and anything other than 2.9.3 needs to be updated. Should there be an update on the WordPress sites that do not have Jetpack 2.9.3?

      If you use Jetpack 2.9.3, you’re indeed safe.

      If you run an old version of the plugin, you’ll need to update to 2.9.3, or to a patched version of your current Jetpack plugin. We’ve provided links to each point release for all eleven vulnerable branches of Jetpack in the article.

      You’ll need to get in touch with the Slim Jetpack plugin authors to make sure.

      Another alternative would be to use Jetpack’s development mode instead of this third-party plugin. The dev mode allows you to use Jetpack without connecting your site to a WordPress.com account. You can read more about it here:

    Something strange happened to me.

    My site has WP 3.8.2 with jetpack 3.9.2. Since 10/04 the site stopped responding; in the error log I found this:

    PHP Fatal error: require\_once() [function.require]:

    Failed opening required ‘…/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/class.jetpack.php’

    (include\_path=’.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php’) in …/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/jetpack.php on line 37

    Looking in the folder “…/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/” I’ve found just a few files of those needed (comparing it to the zip file downloaded from here). All the files are dated “10/04/2014 23.44”, but nobody worked on the site last days. In the folder there is the “readme.txt”: opened, it contains referencing to the version 3.9.3 of jetpack.

    It seems like someone (who? automatically?) tried to update the jetpack without completing the work.

    What’s happened?

    How can I see if the jetpack’s options stored in the db were modified?

    Can I FTP upload the entire folder “jetpack” (3.9.2 or 3.9.3?) to revive the site?

    Do I lost the options doing that?

    Thanks

        Does jetpack has an automatic update service?

        However, I just uploaded the jetpack 3.9.3 via FTP, and all seems to be good: the site’s running and the options are safe.

        As noted above,

        > We have been working closely with the WordPress security team, which has pushed updates to every version of the plugin since 1.9 through core’s auto-update system. We have also coordinated with a number of hosts and network providers to install network-wide blocks to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability, but the only sure fix is updating the plugin.

        We (the Jetpack team) didn’t actually push the auto-update, we put the update together and worked with some WordPress core developers who selected to auto-update WordPress sites that would accept it.

    Why were Site Stats eliminated? I really liked that feature in Jetpack and was surprised to see it eliminated with no warning or mention.

      The WordPress.com Stats module has not been eliminated.

        Well, it completely disappeared from my site when I upgraded. No module on the Jetpack page in my dashboard, no chart at the top of the page when I’m logged in, and when I go to my stats via my bookmark, I get “You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.” I’m not the only person with this problem, judging by some of the other forums I’ve been commenting on.

        Could you please contact support via jetpack.me/contact-support/ ? It certainly should be showing, unless you have some other non-Jetpack code active that is intentionally disabling it.

        My other thought is that perhaps your installation got a bit goofed with the upgrade — the zip didn’t fully unpack — so if you try reinstalling via FTP, it may show up again.

      Turns out the issue is a conflict with the Subscribe2 widget. When I deactivate that, the Site Stats come back. I’ll have to wait until the Subscribe2 widget author resolves the problem in order to see site stats again.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
