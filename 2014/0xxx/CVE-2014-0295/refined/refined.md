  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-0295",
    "description": "A security feature bypass exists in a .NET Framework component that does not properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature, after which the attacker could load additional malicious code in the process in an attempt to exploit another vulnerability.",
    "affected_software": [
      ".NET Framework 1.0 SP3",
      ".NET Framework 1.1 SP1",
      ".NET Framework 2.0 SP2",
      ".NET Framework 3.5",

  },
  "analysis": {
    "en": {
      "overview": "The vulnerability is due to specific .NET Framework components not implementing ASLR, making memory offsets of instructions predictable. An attacker can bypass ASLR and use this to load malicious code.",
      "root_cause": "Specific .NET Framework components were not built to implement the ASLR security feature, leading to predictable memory offsets.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in certain .NET Framework components."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows bypassing ASLR, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if combined with another vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attacks by hosting a malicious site or using compromised websites/user-provided content to load affected .NET components via web browsers capable of instantiating COM components.",
         "Use of a protocol handler to load a non-ASLR dll"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content through a web browser.",
         "notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a website that contains malicious content using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components, like Internet Explorer. EMET can help mitigate this vulnerability when configured for Internet Explorer, and the 'MandatoryASLR' option is enabled."
