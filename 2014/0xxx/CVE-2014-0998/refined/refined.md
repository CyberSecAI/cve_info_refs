- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `vt(4)` code uses a signed integer as an index value without proper validation for negative values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically the lack of checks for negative index values, allows out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can cause a kernel panic by manipulating the index value to access invalid kernel memory regions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `vt(4)` device using ioctl parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker with the ability to interact with the `vt(4)` device via ioctl calls is required. The `vt(4)` driver is not enabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user.
