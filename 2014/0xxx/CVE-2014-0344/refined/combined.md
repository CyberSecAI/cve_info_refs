## ManageEngine OpStor Build 8300 and earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#140886

Original Release Date: 2014-03-27 | Last Revised: 2014-03-27

---

### Overview

ManageEngine OpStor Build 8300 and earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [CWE-472](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/472.html): External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter  It has been reported that the 'Properties.do?name=' module is vulnerable to an ‘unauthorized function call’ caused by server failing to properly verify the privilege level of user (ie; Admin, User, or Guest). This could allow a lower privileged user (ie Guest, User) to modify the hidden ‘edit’ boolean parameter to ‘true’, to gain Admin level authority allowing them to make modification to device name and other information.[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')It has been reported that the module name, mentioned above is also vulnerable to XSS injection by storing malformed name/malicious script provided by user. This malicious name is redistributed across subsequent tabs and subdomain pages in the form of an executable web element. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to read files from the filesystem, read or modify data in the application database, execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser, redirect users to other websites, and forge requests on behalf of the victim. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated that this vulnerability has been address in ManageEngine Build 8500. Affected users are advised to upgrade to ManageEngine Build 8500 or later. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
