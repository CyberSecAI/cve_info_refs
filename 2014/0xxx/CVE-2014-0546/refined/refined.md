Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-0546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw that allows an attacker to bypass the sandbox protection mechanism within Adobe Reader and Acrobat on Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to circumvent the sandbox, a security feature designed to isolate the application and limit its access to system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute native code with escalated privileges on the affected Windows system. This means the attacker could potentially gain control over the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The identified attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability through specially crafted PDF documents. The specific technique to bypass the sandbox is not specified.
- The bulletin mentions that there is evidence of limited, isolated attacks in the wild targeting Adobe Reader users on Windows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF document to a vulnerable user. This could be achieved through various means such as email attachments, compromised websites, or other file-sharing methods.
- The attacker must create a specially crafted PDF document that triggers the sandbox bypass vulnerability.
- The attacker's code will run with escalated privileges once the sandbox is bypassed and the malicious code is executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Adobe Reader and Acrobat on Windows and does not impact OS X versions.
- The document mentions that updates are available for both Reader and Acrobat X and XI.
- This vulnerability is considered critical, and users are strongly advised to update to the patched versions.
- Kaspersky Labs was acknowledged for reporting this vulnerability.
