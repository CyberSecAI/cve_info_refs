A remote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server running Struts 2. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution under certain conditions.",

    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2014-0094. It is present in Struts 2 versions 2.0.0 up to 2.3.16.1 and fixed in 2.3.16.2. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server which can lead to arbitrary remote code execution under certain conditions. The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted HTTP request parameters."
