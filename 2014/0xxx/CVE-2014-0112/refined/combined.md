| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1091939#c0)  David Jorm    2014-04-28 11:06:10 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2014-0094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0094) was incomplete. The Struts 2 ParametersInterceptor was updated to block access to the 'class' parameter, but not all forms in which this parameter can be specified were blocked. A remote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used by the application server running Struts 2. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution under certain conditions.  This flaw is reported to affect Struts 2.0.0 through to Struts 2.3.16.1. It is corrected in 2.3.16.2.  External References:  <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-021>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1091939#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-30 15:18:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.3  Via RHSA-2019:0910 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0910](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0910)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1091939#c8)  Chess Hazlett    2019-08-19 18:11:55 UTC  ``` ack. looks good.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1091939#c9)  Chess Hazlett    2019-09-17 20:29:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  A previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.  The products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars: Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 Single Sign On 7.3.0+  If you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars: 1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location 2. Remove any files found This will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1091939#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-12-20 02:09:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2014-0112>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1595620#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-06-27 08:39:18 UTC  ```  In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.  Upstream issue:  <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=535668>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1595620#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-06-27 08:41:28 UTC  ``` Created jetty tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1595622](show_bug.cgi?id=1595622 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7656 CVE-2017-7657 CVE-2017-7658 jetty: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1595620#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-30 15:18:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.3  Via RHSA-2019:0910 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0910](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0910)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1595620#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2020-04-16 14:32:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of jetty embedded in the nutch package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. The nutch service is not exposed, as such exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](https:///security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 98 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/)

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF.](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF)

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories.](https:///security-alerts/) An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a CVE# which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html)  Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html)

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https:///security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967243.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967243.1)

The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](https:///security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html#JAVA)

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2014.04.25 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:7.5

However the affected code is NOT used at this time:  Candlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited [BZ 1462702](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7525 jackson-databind: Deserialization vulnerability via readValue method of ObjectMapper") , candlepin should not be affected.  However as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.  JBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here:   <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231>  Although JBoss Fuse ships the vulnerable version of jackson-databind, it does not call on enableDefaultTyping() for any polymorphic deserialization operations which is the root cause of this vulnerability. We have raised a Jira tracker to ensure that jackson-databind will be upgraded for Fuse 7.0, however due to feasibility issues jackson-databind cannot be upgraded in JBoss Fuse 6.3.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c58)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-30 15:18:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.3  Via RHSA-2019:0910 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0910](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0910)   ```  [Comment 70](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c70)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-27 00:13:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2858)   ```  [Comment 71](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c71)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-18 19:52:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:3149 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3149](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3149)   ``` |  |

## Summary

Improves excluded params in ParametersInterceptor and CookieInterceptor to avoid ClassLoader manipulation

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | ClassLoader manipulation |
| Maximum security rating | Important |
| Recommendation | Developers should immediately upgrade to [Struts 2.3.20](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2320) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.16.3 |
| Reporter | NTT-CERT via JPCERT/CC, |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2014-0112 - Incomplete fix for ClassLoader manipulation via ParametersInterceptor  CVE-2014-0113 - ClassLoader manipulation via CookieInterceptor when configured to accept all cookies |

## Problem

The excluded parameter pattern introduced in version 2.3.16.1 to block access to getClass() method wasn't sufficient. It is possible to omit that with specially crafted requests. Also CookieInterceptor is vulnerable for the same kind of attack when it was configured to accept all cookies (when "\*" is used to configure `cookiesName` param).

## Solution

In Struts 2.3.20 improved "class" pattern was introduced directly to ParametersInterceptor and CookieInterceptor.

## Backward compatibility

No backward compatibility problems are expected.

## Workaround

## If you cannot upgrade to version 2.3.20 immediately - **which is strongly advised -** you can apply below workarounds:

### Exclude 'class' parameter

Replace the previous class related pattern with '(.\*\.|^|.\*|\[('|"))class(\.|('|")]|\[).\*' on the list of excludeParams as below

```
<interceptor-ref name="params">
  <param name="excludeParams">(.*\.|^|.*|\[('|"))(c|C)lass(\.|('|")]|\[).*,^dojo\..*,^struts\..*,^session\..*,^request\..*,^application\..*,^servlet(Request|Response)\..*,^parameters\..*,^action:.*,^method:.*</param>
</interceptor-ref>
```

It isn't possible to do the same with CookieInterceptor, so don't use wildcard mapping to accept cookie names or implement your own version of CookieInterceptor based on code provided in Struts 2.3.20.

Please be aware that this workaround is not as complete as the corrections in Struts 2.3.20
