The provided content relates to CVE-2014-0379.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TaskSender area in Oracle Demantra 12.2.1 is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the "url" parameter in a POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the `url` parameter. The injected script is then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the vulnerable page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Session hijacking:** An attacker can steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can create fake login pages within the application or redirect users to attacker-controlled pages to steal credentials.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of web pages, damaging the company's reputation.
*   **Browser exploitation:** Attackers can leverage XSS to execute malicious code in the user's browser, potentially gaining full control of the user's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is initiated by sending a crafted POST request to `/demantra/TaskSender` with a malicious payload in the `url` parameter.
*   The injected payload is stored by the application.
*  When a user views the page containing the stored malicious URL, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/demantra/TaskSender` endpoint.
*   No special privileges are explicitly required; however, an authenticated session would be required to access the page containing the stored payload.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that will execute within a user's browser when the affected page is loaded.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the target application server to inject the malicious payload; they could send the exploit request from any location where they can reach the application.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code includes a POST request with the vulnerable parameter `url` containing the malicious Javascript payload `aaa"onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)"`. This code will trigger an alert displaying the user's cookies when the injected link is moused over by a user.

The response shows the injected payload being used in the `href` attribute of the HTML `<a>` tag, without sanitization.
