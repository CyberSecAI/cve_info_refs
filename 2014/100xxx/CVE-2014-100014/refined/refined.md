Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-100014

**Root Cause:** Stack buffer overflow when copying user-supplied input to a fixed-size stack buffer without boundary checks in `pdmwService.exe`. The copying process stops at a null byte, but there's no check on the overall size of data being copied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow. The software copies data into a fixed-size buffer without validating the length of the input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
*   **Lack of Boundary Check:** The code does not check the size of the user-supplied input against the buffer's size before performing the copy operation.
*   **Null Byte Termination:** The copy loop terminates on encountering a null byte, but this doesn't mitigate the overflow if the input data before the null byte is larger than the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit demonstrates a denial-of-service attack. By overflowing the stack buffer and overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and return address, the execution flow can be hijacked leading to crashes.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The exploit description also states that this vulnerability is related to Remote Code Execution. By controlling the execution flow (EIP), the attacker could inject and execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via network communication by sending a specially crafted payload to the vulnerable service through port 30000.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable SolidWorks Workgroup PDM service.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the protocol used by the service to construct a malicious payload, specifically regarding Opcode 2001 and related data structures.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code section performs a `MOVZX` operation to read a WORD from the user supplied buffer, and then it proceeds to copy it to a buffer at `[EDX+EAX]` using `MOV WORD PTR DS:[EDX+EAX],CX`, where `EDX` points to the stack buffer and `EAX` is incremented to continue the copy. The loop continues as long as the copied word is not null, hence making it possible for a larger buffer to overflow.
*   **Exploit Technique:** The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit overwrites the SEH and return address on the stack with address `0x00401000`. The exception is triggered by a read timeout at `0x004B9CB6`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit code provided targets both the SEH and return address for exploitation.
*   Opcodes 2002 and 2003 are also mentioned as vulnerable, implying the potential for similar attacks using different opcodes.
* The vendor was notified but did not respond, leading to public disclosure.
