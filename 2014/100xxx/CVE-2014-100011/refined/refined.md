Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) in the Sendy application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `c` parameter of the `send-to` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application database.
- This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    - Data exfiltration of sensitive data.
    - Data modification or deletion.
    - Potential for complete database takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the GET request parameter `c` in the `send-to` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious SQL payloads that are injected through this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- The exploit can be carried out remotely.
- The provided exploit uses `sqlmap`, which indicates that the attacker does not need to be authenticated, assuming the `PHPSESSID` and `logged_in` cookies can be obtained.
