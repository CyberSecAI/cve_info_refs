Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-100002

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine Support Center Plus versions 7916 and lower. The application fails to properly sanitize file paths when creating a ticket with an attachment, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the application's failure to validate or sanitize the `attach` parameter when creating a ticket. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server hosting the application. 
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download these files and potentially gain access to sensitive system or application data, depending on the location and content of the accessed files. 
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** The exploit-db entry notes that on Windows, the Support Center Plus instance usually runs with SYSTEM privileges, while on Linux, it often runs as root. An attacker could potentially leverage the ability to access arbitrary files to further compromise the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/WorkOrder.do` URL when creating a new ticket. The attacker manipulates the `attach` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **File Attachment:** The vulnerability is triggered by attaching a file to the ticket creation request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Support Center Plus instance.
*   **Ticket Creation Privilege:**  The attacker needs the ability to create tickets. The provided exploit details mention a `Guest` user, so it may be possible for any user to exploit this vulnerability, including users with low privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Server File Paths:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the server's file system to craft the appropriate file paths in the `attach` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry states that the vulnerability was fixed sometime in 2013, indicating that updating to a version higher than 7916 would mitigate this issue.
*   The provided `POST` parameters demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability by specifying a path to `/etc/passwd`.
