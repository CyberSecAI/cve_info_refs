The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in FlatPress version 1.0.2 and possibly earlier versions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when handling user-supplied data, specifically within the 'content' parameter of a POST request to the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability is present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the FlatPress application.
- These malicious scripts could be executed within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection of users to malicious sites.
    - Theft of sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a crafted URL using a POST request.
- The vulnerable parameter is 'content', where the malicious script is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a specific URL with a malicious script payload in the POST 'content' parameter.
- The attacker must be able to induce a user to visit the crafted link.
- No authentication is needed, as this is a reflected XSS.
