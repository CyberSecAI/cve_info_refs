{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `PreviewNum` and `CatID` parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to `ChangeEmail.php` with a malicious `PreviewNum` parameter",
    "HTTP GET requests to `ViewCat.php` with a malicious `CatID` parameter"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required."
