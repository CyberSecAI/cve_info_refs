The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the Js-Multi-Hotel WordPress plugin, which is likely related to CVE-2014-100009 based on the date.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Abuse of Functionality (WASC-42):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `show_image.php` script allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL in the `file` parameter, which the script attempts to process as an image.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `show_image.php` script with a malicious URL in the `file` parameter
    *   **Impact:** This can be abused to make the server fetch and process arbitrary content, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Attacker capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable plugin.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (WASC-10):**
    *   **Root cause:** Similar to the abuse of functionality, but specifically targets the server by providing the URL of a large file in the `file` parameter.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `show_image.php` script with a large file URL in the `file` parameter
    *   **Impact:** By causing the server to download and attempt to process a very large file, an attacker can cause a denial of service.
    *   **Attacker capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Additional info**: The vulnerability can be used for both manual and automated DoS/DDoS attacks, including with the aid of the DAVOSET tool.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (WASC-08):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `delete_img.php` script is vulnerable to XSS because the `path` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `delete_img.php` script with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `path` parameter
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *  **Attacker capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Additional info:** Another XSS vulnerability exists in `refreshDate.php` via the `roomid` parameter, previously disclosed.

*   **Full Path Disclosure (FPD) (WASC-13):**
    *  **Root cause:** The scripts reveal the server's full file path when accessed directly, due to lack of proper access control or error handling.
    *  **Attack vector:** Accessing various PHP scripts directly via the web browser, revealing the absolute file path.
    *  **Impact:** The disclosure of file paths can aid attackers in mapping the server's file system and potentially identify vulnerabilities in the application or other plugins.
    * **Attacker capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable plugin.
    * **Affected files:**
        *   `functions.php`
        *   `myCalendar.php`
        *   `refreshDate.php`
        *   `show_image.php`
        *   `widget.php`
        *   `phpthumb/GdThumb.inc.php`
        *   `phpthumb/thumb_plugins/gd_reflection.inc.php`

**Affected Versions:**

*   Js-Multi-Hotel plugin versions 2.2.1 and earlier are vulnerable.
