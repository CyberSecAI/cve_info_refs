Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-100015

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how SolidWorks Workgroup PDM handles file uploads. Specifically, it doesn't properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate the destination of the uploaded file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The core weakness is the ability to write arbitrary files to the server's file system.
- **Path Traversal:**  The vulnerability is achieved via path traversal, by using ".." sequences in the filename an attacker can write a file to an arbitrary location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By writing malicious executable files to specific locations like the startup folder, or by writing a MOF file to schedule a task, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the affected machine.
- **Data Manipulation:** Ability to write files allows for modifying existing files or creating new ones, leading to data corruption or tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based (Remote):** The attack is initiated over the network, targeting the vulnerable `pdmwService.exe` service which listens on port 30000.
- **Custom Crafted Packets:** The attacker sends specially crafted packets to the service. These packets include an opcode, filename (with path traversal sequences), file size and file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the machine running SolidWorks Workgroup PDM and access to the service listening on port 30000.
- **No Authentication:** The exploit does not require any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `pdmwService.exe`.
- The attacker sends an opcode `\xD0\x07\x00\x00`, followed by the length of the filename, the filename itself (including path traversal sequences like `..\..\`), the file size, and then the file's content.
- The provided Python script and Metasploit module demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The Metasploit module supports targeting different Windows versions by writing the payload to startup folders (for Vista and later) or by using a MOF file and WMI to execute the payload (for Windows XP and earlier).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified but did not respond.
- The exploit has been verified and successfully tested against SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2011 SP0 on both Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.
- The vulnerability affects SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2014 SP2 and prior.
