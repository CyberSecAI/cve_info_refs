![Self-Service Area](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/screenshots/home-self-service-area.png?v=1715357196)

### Self-Service Area

![Self-Service Area](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/screenshots/home-automation-and-tools.png?v=1715357196)

### Automation + Tools

Take advantage of a number of [useful tools](product/tour#automation-and-tools) to improve and automate parts of your workflow, so that you spend less time carrying out repetitive tasks and more on offering great support.

![Multi-Channel Support](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/channels.svg?v=1715357196)

### Multi-Channel Support

SupportPal elegantly brings all customer communication into one place. Communicate with customers via a wealth of channels - email, web, API, help widget, phone, SMS and social media.

![Multiple Frontends for Brands](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/screenshots/home-multiple-frontends.png?v=1715357196)

### Multiple Brands

SupportPal makes it easy to handle support requests for several companies (we call them brands) through a single backend, simplifying access for staff and management of the system. Each brand can have its own personalised frontend with a unique self-service area, and your users won't realise that the brands are connected.

Brand and department permissions are completely configurable, so operators can see and deal with only what is relevant to them.

![Multilingual Support](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/languages.png?v=1715357196)

### Multilingual Support

Offering support in multiple languages has never been easier. SupportPal lets you translate all dynamic text; such as department names, article content and email templates; so you can offer a seamless customer support experience to users around the world.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
