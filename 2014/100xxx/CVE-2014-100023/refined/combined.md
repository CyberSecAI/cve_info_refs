How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Очень хороший плагин!

Thought it would be easy to find an educational quiz plug, but so many of the ones I tried were really more suitable for marketing. After lots of frustrating dead ends, I found this one, which fits the bill perfectly. Audio, visuals and text, and works great on a touch screen mobile. Very happy to have found it.

This is a great plugin, my choice for quizzes always.
Only one request, please make the styles (mtq\_core\_style.css, mtq\_theme\_style.css) to load only on the pages where the shortcode is used. It’s two files that Page Speed Test is always complaining about and they are absolutely useless on most pages.
Thanks.

Everything has been good for years as far as I know but just recently this plugin has stopped working on a few of my friends’ phones. It’s not all the time so I’m not sure what the problem is. If you can update the code a bit I’m happy to bug hunt or help if I can.
2020/01/03: No updates for the past 3 versions of WordPress. Unfortunately, I’m moving all the quiz data into a spreadsheet as a backup before removing this plugin. I just wish the bugs could have been checked and the plugin was only loaded on pages we put the quizzes on. This plugin loads render-blocking code on your website’s top page.
