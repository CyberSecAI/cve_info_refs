Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-100023:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from unescaped output of a GET parameter in the `question.php` file of the mTouch Quiz plugin for WordPress.
*   **Weakness:**  The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (specifically, the `quiz` GET parameter) before displaying it in HTML context leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when an administrator visits the affected page. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Account takeover:** The attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the admin's account.
    *   **Malicious actions:**  The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the admin (e.g., create new admin users, modify plugin settings, etc.).
    *   **Defacement:** Inject arbitrary content on the website.
    *   **Data theft:** Exfiltrate sensitive data from the affected admin panel.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is network-based and requires a logged-in administrator to visit a crafted URL.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing Javascript.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to visit this URL.

**Technical Details from dxw advisory:**
*   The vulnerable file is `question.php` within the `mtouch-quiz` plugin.
*   The unescaped output occurs on lines 87 and 94 of the file.
*   An additional unescaped SQL query using the same parameter is present on line 117 (related to CVE-2014-100022).
*   The advisory provides a proof-of-concept URL demonstrating how to inject malicious JavaScript via the `quiz` parameter. This payload includes an external JavaScript resource. It also demonstrates how a simple XSS can be used to trigger a DoS attack by embedding multiple iframes loading SQL injections.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin is no longer available for download on the WordPress plugin directory because of this security issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in August 2013, reported in February 2014, and a fix was discovered in March 2014.
*   The advisory from dxw assigns a high CVSS score (9) to this vulnerability, given the potential for significant impact.
*  The issue was present in version 3.0.6.
*   The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to a fixed version, although the plugin was removed from the WordPress plugin directory.

**CVE Assignment:**

* CVE-2014-100023 is specifically assigned to the XSS vulnerability. CVE-2014-100022 was assigned to the SQL injection vulnerability in the same file.

In summary, CVE-2014-100023 describes a high-severity XSS vulnerability in the mTouch Quiz plugin that could allow attackers to compromise WordPress admin accounts and perform malicious actions.
