Allows even add a note, which displays after correct or wrong answer was clicked.

Очень хороший плагин!
Позволяет даже вставлять пояснение – как после правильного, так и после неправильного ответа.

Thought it would be easy to find an educational quiz plug, but so many of the ones I tried were really more suitable for marketing. After lots of frustrating dead ends, I found this one, which fits the bill perfectly. Audio, visuals and text, and works great on a touch screen mobile. Very happy to have found it.

This is a great plugin, my choice for quizzes always.
Only one request, please make the styles (mtq\_core\_style.css, mtq\_theme\_style.css) to load only on the pages where the shortcode is used. It’s two files that Page Speed Test is always complaining about and they are absolutely useless on most pages.
Thanks.

Everything has been good for years as far as I know but just recently this plugin has stopped working on a few of my friends’ phones. It’s not all the time so I’m not sure what the problem is. If you can update the code a bit I’m happy to bug hunt or help if I can.
2020/01/03: No updates for the past 3 versions of WordPress. Unfortunately, I’m moving all the quiz data into a spreadsheet as a backup before removing this plugin. I just wish the bugs could have been checked and the plugin was only loaded on pages we put the quizzes on. This plugin loads render-blocking code on your website’s top page.
