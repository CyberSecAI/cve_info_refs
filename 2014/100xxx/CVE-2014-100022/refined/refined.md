The provided content relates to CVE-2014-100022.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from unescaped output of a GET parameter within the `question.php` file of the mTouch Quiz plugin. Specifically, the `quiz` GET parameter is used in an unescaped SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct use of the `quiz` GET parameter in a SQL query.
- Unescaped output of a GET parameter, which could also lead to XSS (addressed by CVE-2014-100023).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection could lead to complete compromise of confidentiality and availability, as well as partial integrity impact. An attacker could read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user can manipulate the `quiz` GET parameter in the URL when accessing `question.php`.
- The vulnerable code is located within the WordPress admin panel: `wp-admin/edit.php?page=mtouch-quiz/question.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs, specifically the `quiz` parameter value.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in administrator to access this URL.
