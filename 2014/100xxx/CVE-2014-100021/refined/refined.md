Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `empsearch[employee_name][empId]` parameter within the OrangeHRM employee search functionality is vulnerable to XSS. The application does not properly sanitize user input before reflecting it in the web page.

**Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation for the employee ID search parameter.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/k/cms/orange/orangehrm-3.1.1/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewEmployeeList` with a specially crafted payload in the `empsearch[employee_name][empId]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
* Ability to send HTTP POST requests
* Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`empsearch[employee_name][empId]`)
* Ability to craft malicious JavaScript payload.
* Attacker must have access to an administrative account to perform the search.

**Impact:**
* Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when accessing the employee list, leading to potential:
    * Session hijacking
    * Data theft
    * Defacement of the web page
    * Other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session.

**Technical details:**
The provided POST request shows the structure of the malicious request:

```
POST /k/cms/orange/orangehrm-3.1.1/symfony/web/index.php/pim/viewEmployeeList HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.149.14.62
(...)
Content-Length: 418

empsearch%5Bemployee_name%5D%5BempName%5D=asdasd&empsearch%5Bemployee_name%5D%5BempId%5D='%3e"%3e%3cbody%2fonload%3dalert(9999)%3e&empsearch%5Bid%5D=&empsearch%5Bemployee_status%5D=0&empsearch%5Btermination%5D=1&empsearch%5Bsupervisor_name%5D=asdasd&empsearch%5Bjob_title%5D=0&empsearch%5Bsub_unit%5D=0&empsearch%5BisSubmitted%5D=yes&empsearch%5B_csrf_token%5D=109e14ec2ad65dc3a8eaa4bf8c28582a&pageNo=&hdnAction=search
```

The vulnerable parameter is `empsearch[employee_name][empId]`, which contains the XSS payload: `'><body onload=alert(9999)>` This will cause an alert box to appear if the XSS is successful.

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post mentions that this is an XSS vulnerability in OrangeHRM 3.1.1.
* The issue has been fixed in OrangeHRM 3.1.2.
* The vulnerability requires an admin user to perform the search operation.
