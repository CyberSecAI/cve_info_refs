### Automation + Tools

Take advantage of a number of [useful tools](product/tour#automation-and-tools) to improve and automate parts of your workflow, so that you spend less time carrying out repetitive tasks and more on offering great support.

![Multi-Channel Support](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/channels.svg?v=1715357196)

### Multi-Channel Support

SupportPal elegantly brings all customer communication into one place. Communicate with customers via a wealth of channels - email, web, API, help widget, phone, SMS and social media.

![Multiple Frontends for Brands](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/screenshots/home-multiple-frontends.png?v=1715357196)

### Multiple Brands

SupportPal makes it easy to handle support requests for several companies (we call them brands) through a single backend, simplifying access for staff and management of the system. Each brand can have its own personalised frontend with a unique self-service area, and your users won't realise that the brands are connected.

Brand and department permissions are completely configurable, so operators can see and deal with only what is relevant to them.

![Multilingual Support](https://www.supportpal.com/assets/img/languages.png?v=1715357196)

### Multilingual Support

Offering support in multiple languages has never been easier. SupportPal lets you translate all dynamic text; such as department names, article content and email templates; so you can offer a seamless customer support experience to users around the world.
