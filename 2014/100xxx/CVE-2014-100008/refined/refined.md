    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-100008",
      "root_cause": "The Js-Multi-Hotel WordPress plugin contains multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and insecure handling of file paths.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Abuse of Functionality: The `show_image.php` script allows arbitrary URLs to be provided as a 'file' parameter, potentially leading to abuse of functionality.",
        "Denial of Service (DoS): The `show_image.php` script can be used to cause a denial of service by requesting large files using the 'file' parameter, or by repeatedly requesting content from arbitrary URLs.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `delete_img.php` script is vulnerable to XSS, where malicious JavaScript can be injected via the 'path' parameter.",
         "Full Path Disclosure (FPD): Multiple PHP files within the plugin disclose their full server path when directly accessed."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to various negative impacts, including:\n - Arbitrary file retrieval, potential sensitive information disclosure \n - Denial of service attacks, making the affected website unavailable \n - Execution of arbitrary Javascript code within the context of the website, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities \n - Disclosure of server file paths, aiding further attacks",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests with crafted URLs targeting vulnerable PHP scripts.",
        "The 'file' parameter in `show_image.php` is used to include an arbitrary URL.",
        "The 'path' parameter in `delete_img.php` is used to inject malicious JavaScript.",
         "Direct access to vulnerable PHP files."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted website. No prior access or user privileges are required.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found in Js-Multi-Hotel plugin version 2.2.1 and prior. The identified vulnerabilities include Abuse of Functionality, Denial of Service, Cross-Site Scripting, and Full Path Disclosure. Specific vulnerable files are `show_image.php`, `delete_img.php`, `functions.php`, `myCalendar.php`, `refreshDate.php`, `widget.php`, `GdThumb.inc.php`, and `gd_reflection.inc.php`."
