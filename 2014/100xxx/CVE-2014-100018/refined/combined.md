## Description

If you run a WordPress or BuddyPress installation, you probably know that some of the biggest administrative headaches come from the activation process. Activation emails may be caught by spam filters, deleted unwillingly, or simply not understood. Yet WordPress itself has no UI for viewing and managing unactivated members.

Unconfirmed creates a Dashboard panel under the Users menu (Network Admin > Users on Multisite) that shows a list of unactivated user registrations. For each registration, you have the option of resending the original activation email, or manually activating the user.

Note that the plugin works for the following configurations:

1. Multisite, with or without BuddyPress

2. Single site, with BuddyPress used for user registration

There is currently no support for single-site WP registration without BuddyPress.

## Installation

1. Install
2. Activate
3. Navigate to Network Admin > Users > Unconfirmed

Thank you developers!
I used in a multisite and it has worked. If it helps any person, do not forget that the users (that not accepted) are located in the main network site, the Network Admin

Great that you’ve created this software. Easy to use, just go to network admin, users and unconfirmed and resend the activation link or enable the user. No hassle anymore. 🙂

Thank you for this plugin. Not sure why such a feature isn’t already part of Core, as it’s very useful when managing a multisite!
