Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that changing a user's email address in WordPress did not invalidate previously issued password reset emails/links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate session management related to password reset functionality. Specifically, the password reset mechanism did not track email changes and didn't invalidate existing password reset links when an email address was modified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has gained access to a password reset email (e.g., through eavesdropping or social engineering) could potentially use the link to reset the user's password, even after the user has changed their email address.
- This would effectively bypass the user's control over their account security and could lead to unauthorized access.
- If the email was obtained by an attacker prior to the legitimate user changing the email address, the attacker could still use the link, as it was not invalidated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs access to an old password reset email. This could be obtained through various means, like:
    - Intercepting the password reset email.
    - Gaining access to the victim's inbox through other means.
    - Through social engineering.
- The attacker does not need to interact with the victim directly after obtaining the email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have possession of a valid password reset email link. This email could have been generated before the user changed their associated email address.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have access to the server.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability if they have the reset email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress versions 4.0.1, 3.9.3, 3.8.5, and 3.7.5, where a change was made to invalidate password reset keys upon email modification.
- This issue is distinct from a CSRF vulnerability in the password reset process (CVE-2014-9033) which allows a user to be tricked into changing their password.
