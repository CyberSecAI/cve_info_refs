Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of corrupted WPG (WordPerfect Graphics) files within ImageMagick. Specifically, the program does not stop processing corrupted WPG files, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate the structure and integrity of WPG files.
- **Crash:** Continuing to process a corrupted WPG file results in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted, corrupted WPG file can cause ImageMagick to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File Input:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted, corrupted WPG file to ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to the ImageMagick application. This can be achieved through various means, including:
   -  Uploading the file to a web application that uses ImageMagick.
   -  Having the user process the file using a command-line tool or other ImageMagick interface.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this issue involves ensuring that ImageMagick does not continue processing corrupted WPG files, preventing the crash.
