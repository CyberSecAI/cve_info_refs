{
    "CVE-2014-9273": {
        "description": "The hivex library does not properly handle small-sized hive files and also doesn't check that pages do not extend beyond the end of the file. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
        "affected_component": "hivex library",
        "root_cause": "Missing size checks when reading hive files, allowing out-of-bounds memory access due to small, truncated or malformed files",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Out-of-bounds read",
            "Out-of-bounds write"
         ],
        "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, denial of service.",
         "attack_vectors": [
            "Maliciously crafted small or truncated hive files provided to an application using hivex."
         ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to supply a specially crafted hive file to an application that uses the vulnerable hivex library",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating a short or truncated hive file, leading to out-of-bounds read or write operations. The issue is that hivex attempts to read, and possibly write, beyond its allocated buffer when processing a specially crafted hive file. Exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application."
