  "CVE-2014-9528": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insecure handling of the `$lastEntryId` parameter in the `actionIndex()` function of `protected/modules_core/notification/controllers/ListController.php`. The parameter, fetched from the `from` GET parameter, isn't properly sanitized and is used in a SQL query without proper type checking. PHP's type-unstrict comparison allows an attacker to inject SQL by prepending integers before the SQL payload, which bypasses the integer comparison check.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Type-unstrict comparisons in PHP"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can perform SQL injection to gain access to the backend database and perform a binary search SQL injection. Additionally, the SQL error handling allows a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, leading to potential CSRF attacks.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET parameter (`from`) manipulation",
         "SQL injection via unsanitized parameter",
         "Reflected XSS via SQL error messages"
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a regular authenticated user of the Humhub system to exploit the vulnerability."
