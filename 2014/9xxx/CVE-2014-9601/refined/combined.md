### @wiredfool **[wiredfool](/wiredfool)** commented [Dec 29, 2014](#issue-53079105)

[@hugovk](https://github.com/hugovk) [@aclark4life](https://github.com/aclark4life)

Two outstanding bits:

1. interface for the developer -- It behaves a little differently than the decompression bomb warning in that this just tosses a value error. But it's less likely to have false positives.
2. It doesn't defend against images that have many just under the limit text segments.

Opinions?

(note that I had to change the test to pass -- I believe that the new version is also a reasonable representation of an invalid iTXt segment)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks [@wiredfool](https://github.com/wiredfool). Re: 1, Right now I'm more concerned about preventing a DOS than providing a consistent API and re: 2, can we reasonably defend against images with many-just-under-the-limit text segments? |

| That was less invasive than I'd thought. Implementation allowing 64 \* maxsize total memory usage for text chunks, and a test attempting to save 128 of them. ( ~8k or so of compressed text chunks in the image would expand to ~128M) |

`assertTrue` is a bit clearer (for me) than `assert_` here.

| 👍 in general, with minor review notes.  Did you want `test_dos_total_memory()` and `test_dos_total_memory()` to run on Travis CI? I'm guessing not, as they're in a file named `check_...` and not `test_...`. Are they terribly slow to run? If not, can they be moved under Travis? |

| They're not especially slow, and as most of the DOS ones go, it's not a problem once we've solved the issue. They may be a bit more of an issue running the tests in a resource constrained environment, so I'd rather not run them by default. |

## Security Advisory: Pillow security release

Posted by **Tim Graham** on Jan. 2, 2015

Yesterday, [Pillow 2.7.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.7.0) was released fixing [potential denial of service attacks using compressed text chunks](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/releasenotes/2.7.0.html#png-text-chunk-size-limits). Pillow is the library used to back Django's ImageField. If you are using ImageField, and particularly if you accept uploads from untrusted users, we encourage you to upgrade as soon as possible.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
