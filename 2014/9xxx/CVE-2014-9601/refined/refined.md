{
  "CVE-2014-9601": {
    "Description": "Pillow before 2.7.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a compressed text chunk in a PNG image that has a large size when it is decompressed.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Pillow handles compressed text chunks within PNG images. Specifically, it doesn't properly limit the size of decompressed data, allowing an attacker to create a specially crafted PNG image with a small compressed text chunk that expands to a very large size when decompressed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient checks on the size of decompressed data",
       "Lack of limits on the size of compressed text chunks"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exploiting this vulnerability. By sending a malicious PNG image to a system using a vulnerable version of Pillow, the system can be forced to allocate excessive memory during the decompression process, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the network, specifically by sending a malicious PNG image to a vulnerable system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted PNG file to the target system. No authentication is required.",
     "Additional Information": "The fix involved limiting the total size of decompressed text chunks to 64KB, preventing the excessive memory allocation."
