- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Java client used insufficient encoding to pass credentials, effectively transmitting them in a manner equivalent to plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate encryption strength (CWE-326). The method of encrypting credentials is not strong enough, allowing for easy decoding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor to gain complete access to the server by sniffing and decoding network traffic. This could result in unauthorized access and control of the SCADA system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sniffing network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs access to the network where the vulnerable Clorius Controls A/S Java web client is communicating. No specialized skills are required to exploit this vulnerability.
