The provided content is related to CVE-2014-9694.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Huawei server products do not use the Token mechanism for web access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of token-based access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow attackers to tamper with the server configuration or restart the system.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers need to trick users into accessing a website that contains malicious CSRF script. When the user, already logged into the Huawei server, accesses this website, the script is executed against the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to construct malicious websites accessible to the targeted users who are also logged into the affected Huawei servers. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the server itself.
