Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload implementation within the `senddocument.php` script found in both Zarafa WebAccess and Zarafa WebApp. This script allowed unauthenticated users to upload files to the server's `/tmp` directory without proper restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The `senddocument.php` script did not require any authentication, allowing any remote user to upload files.
*   **Lack of Size Limits/Restrictions:** While there was a default upload size limit of 30 MB, this was not enforced in a way that prevented multiple uploads leading to disk exhaustion
*  **Insecure temporary file creation:** The use of `tempnam()` to create temporary files, while not directly predictable, does not prevent filling the `/tmp` directory if the vulnerability is exploited with repeated uploads.
*   **Unused Script:** The `senddocument.php` script was not used by any other part of the Zarafa WebAccess or WebApp code, making it an unnecessary attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact was a denial of service caused by filling the `/tmp` directory. If `/tmp` was located on the root partition, it could exhaust the entire disk space of the server.
*   **Service Disruption:** A full `/tmp` directory could lead to the failure of other services on the server, not just Zarafa, making the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any user credentials.
*  **HTTP(S) requests:** The vulnerability was exploited by sending HTTP(S) requests to the vulnerable `senddocument.php` script containing uploaded files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needed network access to the server hosting Zarafa WebAccess or WebApp.
*   **No authentication required** The attacker didn't need any user credentials.
*  **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker should be capable of sending HTTP requests with file uploads

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Zarafa WebAccess versions >= 7.0.0 and in all versions of Zarafa WebApp until the fix was released.
*   The fix involved removing the vulnerable `senddocument.php` files.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Robert Scheck
*   The issue was tracked as ZCP-12596 in Zarafa's Jira.
*   The vendor was slow in providing a fix and public disclosure occurred before a final release from Zarafa.
*   The advisory from Robert Scheck lists all affected and fixed versions of Zarafa WebAccess and WebApp.
*   The Mageia bug report also includes patches that addressed related issues in the packaging of Zarafa.
