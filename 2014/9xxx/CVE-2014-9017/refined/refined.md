```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the task name field, leading to reflected XSS.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: A malicious user creates a task with a specially crafted name containing malicious JavaScript. This task is then assigned to a victim user. When the victim views the task notification, the malicious script is executed.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have an account on the OpenKM platform and be able to create tasks. They also need to know the username of the targeted victim.
