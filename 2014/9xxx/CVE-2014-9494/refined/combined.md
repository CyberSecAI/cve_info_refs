| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174872#c0)  Martin Prpič    2014-12-16 16:17:25 UTC  ``` In RabbitMQ, the 'loopback_users' configuration directive allows to specify a list of users that are only permitted to connect to the broker via localhost. It was found that the RabbitMQ's management plug-in did not sufficiently validate the 'X-Forwarded-For' header when determining the remote address. A remote attacker able to send a specially crafted 'X-Forwarded-For' header to RabbitMQ could use this flaw to connect to the broker as if they were a localhost user. Note that the attacker must know valid user credentials in order to connect to the broker.
