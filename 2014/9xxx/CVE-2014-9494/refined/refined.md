  "cveId": "CVE-2014-9494",
  "description": "The RabbitMQ management plugin trusts the easily-forged \"X-Forwarded-For\" header when determining the remote address. It is therefore possible to subvert this access control mechanism for the HTTP API. Attackers would still need to know or guess the username and password.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Insufficient validation of the 'X-Forwarded-For' header in the RabbitMQ management plugin.",
    "weakness": "The HTTP framework trusts the 'X-Forwarded-For' header, which can be easily forged.",
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass the 'loopback_users' access control mechanism and connect to the broker as if they were a localhost user.",
    "attackVector": "Sending a specially crafted 'X-Forwarded-For' header to RabbitMQ.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "Remote attacker needs to know or guess valid user credentials to connect to the broker."
