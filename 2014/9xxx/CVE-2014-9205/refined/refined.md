Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `PmBase64Decode` function in MICROSYS PROMOTIC software copies attacker-supplied data into a fixed-size buffer without validating the length of the data. This leads to a buffer overflow when the supplied data exceeds the buffer's capacity. The function ignores the passed-in length of the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Lack of input validation: The `PmBase64Decode` function does not validate the length of the attacker-supplied data, leading to the overflow.
- Vulnerable function: The `PmBase64Decode` function is specifically identified as the source of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected PROMOTIC process.
- Denial of service:  The overflow can lead to a crash of the application, resulting in a denial of service.
- Data leakage: There is also a mention of potential data leakage, although the specifics are not provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low skill level: The advisory indicates that an attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability, if the vulnerable demonstration application is running.
- Network access: The attacker must be able to communicate with the PROMOTIC system over the network.
- No authentication required: Exploiting the vulnerability does not require authentication.
- Running application: The vulnerability is only exploitable when a specific vulnerable demonstration application is running within PROMOTIC.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `PmBase64Decode` function.
-  A patch was released by MICROSYS in PROMOTIC versions 8.2.19 and 8.3.2.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID '17064'.
-  The advisory notes that there were no known public exploits at the time of disclosure, but also states that the exploitability is straightforward.
