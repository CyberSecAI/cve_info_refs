  "CVE-2014-9271": {
    "Description": "MantisBT is vulnerable to XSS in file uploads. An attacker can upload a Flash file with an image extension. If such an attachment is displayed inline, it becomes a vector for XSS attacks. This is due to improper handling of file content types, where the system relies on file extensions for determining content handling rather than MIME types.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the application's reliance on file extensions rather than MIME types to determine how to handle file uploads, coupled with a lack of proper sanitization and content-type validation, particularly for inline display.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Inadequate file type validation",
	  "Improper handling of file content-types"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when the malicious attachment is viewed inline. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the MantisBT application or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a malicious Flash file disguised with an image extension (e.g. .jpg, .png). When this file is displayed inline, it allows the embedded malicious code to execute.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload attachments to MantisBT and knowledge on how to craft a malicious Flash file."
