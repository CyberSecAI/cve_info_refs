Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2014-9130 vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an assertion failure within the `yaml_parser_save_simple_key` function in `scanner.c` of the libyaml library. This assertion is triggered when parsing specially crafted YAML input with wrapped strings, leading to an application crash. The root cause is improper handling of wrapped strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reachable assertion:** An "impossible" assert statement in the `yaml_parser_save_simple_key` function can be reached with specific YAML input, leading to a program abort/crash. The vulnerability is in the C code, also affecting perl YAML-XS module as it includes the vulnerable code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in an application crash, leading to a denial of service. The application becomes unavailable for further processing of YAML input.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not confirmed, some sources mention the *possibility* of arbitrary code execution. This may be related to the buffer overflow that was fixed in the same time in the libyaml library with CVE-2014-2525 (see below).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted YAML input:** Attackers need to provide a specifically crafted YAML input to trigger the vulnerability. The input contains wrapped strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide untrusted YAML input:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable application with untrusted, specially crafted YAML input.
- The attacker needs network access to an application that parses user supplied YAML data.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `scanner.c` within the libyaml library.
- The issue affects not only the core libyaml library but also libraries that embed parts of it, like perl's YAML-LibYAML (YAML-XS) module, and python's PyYAML which has similar assert that can be exploited.
- The vulnerable assertion was intended to be "impossible," according to the source code comment, indicating the logic error.
- A fix involves either removing the problematic assertion or properly handling the input scenario that triggers the assertion.
- Patches have been developed to address the issue. The assertion is removed in some patches. Other fixes focus on fixing the root cause to avoid triggering the assertion.
- The vulnerability was found using a fuzzer(afl).
- A sample YAML input that triggers the vulnerability is:
```yaml
  a: "
"
  b: true
```
- This issue is also related to CVE-2014-2525 (Heap overflow), which indicates similar issues were being investigated at the same time.
- Red Hat has classified this issue as having "Moderate" security impact.
