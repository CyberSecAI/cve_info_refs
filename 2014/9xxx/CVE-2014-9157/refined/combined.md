In case anyone is wondering how to cherry-pick this to 2.38 (as I was), I found a patch from Ubuntu at [this Debian bug](https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-packages/2014/12/msg00048.html).

Note: I'm not a graphviz developer; this is not authoritative :-)

Is there any known way to make `yytext` contain the format string?

I see it's possible to inject format string via file name and (after [dc6f1e0](https://github.com/ellson/MOTHBALLED-graphviz/commit/dc6f1e04533b459d521f39ad854e8cae13dc28fb)) via unclosed qstring or hstring, but I've not got to get it to `yytext`.

Quick grep over sources found few other `agerr()` calls with second argument not being a fixed string.

<https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/31158b1/lib/cgraph/scan.l#L168>

Same file, `chkNum()` function. Format string can be injected via graph file name:

```
$ cat fs4-%n%s%s%s%s%s%s.dot
graph G { a [ weight = 0g ] }

$ dot fs4-%n%s%s%s%s%s%s.dot
Warning: *** %n in writable segment detected ***
Aborted

```

<https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/31158b1/lib/graph/lexer.c#L463>

<https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/31158b1/lib/graph/lexer.c#L469>

<https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/31158b1/lib/graph/lexer.c#L472>

libgraph is deprecated since 2.30.0. In older graphviz versions, format string can be injected via graph file content.

<https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/blob/31158b1/cmd/tools/gmlscan.l#L130>

This case would require format string in `yytext`, so it's unclear to me if it's possible or not.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : graphviz
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9157
Debian Bug     : 772648

Joshua Rogers discovered a format string vulnerability in the yyerror
function in lib/cgraph/scan.l in Graphviz, a rich set of graph drawing
tools. An attacker could use this flaw to cause graphviz to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.26.3-14+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon in version 2.38.0-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.38.0-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
