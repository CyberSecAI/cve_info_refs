Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in Roundcube Webmail. Specifically, certain actions related to the address book, the Access Control List (ACL) plugin, and the Managesieve plugin were susceptible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the mentioned areas of Roundcube.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by tricking them into executing unintended actions via a malicious website or email. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized modifications to the user's address book.
    - Changes to the user's ACL settings
    - Unintended actions within the Managesieve plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that exploits the vulnerable endpoints. The request could be disguised as a legitimate action.
- The victim would need to be logged into their Roundcube account and be tricked into interacting with the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML or JavaScript that can be delivered to a Roundcube user.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the Roundcube server.
- The attacker needs the user to interact with a malicious link or content.
