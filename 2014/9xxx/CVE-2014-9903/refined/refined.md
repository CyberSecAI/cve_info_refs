Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9903:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `sys_sched_getattr()` function, where the code copies an on-stack structure to userspace. The issue is that the code was using a user-supplied size (`usize`) when copying data to user space using `copy_to_user` instead of the actual size of the structure (`attr->size`). The `usize` variable could be larger than the actual size of the on-stack struct, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** Due to the incorrect size parameter in `copy_to_user()`, the kernel copies more data than intended from the stack to userspace. This extra data could include sensitive information from the stack, such as parts of other kernel structures and addresses.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds read because `copy_to_user` reads beyond the intended boundary of the on-stack structure in kernel memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user-space process could exploit this flaw to read kernel memory, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like:
    - Kernel addresses
    - Data belonging to other processes
    - Internal kernel states

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by calling the `sys_sched_getattr()` system call with a user-provided size parameter that's larger than the actual structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local system and have the ability to call the `sys_sched_getattr()` system call.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using kmemcheck and the trinity fuzzer.
- The fix was to use `attr->size` instead of `usize` in the `copy_to_user()` function.
- The commit message mentions the fix relates to commit `d50dde5`, which introduced the new scheduler syscalls.
