{
  "CVE-2014-9710": {
    "Description": "The Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure that the visible xattr state is consistent with a requested replacement, which allows local users to bypass intended ACL settings and gain privileges via standard filesystem operations (1) during an xattr-replacement time window, related to a race condition, or (2) after an xattr-replacement attempt that fails because the data does not fit.",
    "Root cause": "Race condition during xattr replacement in Btrfs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Non-atomic xattr replacement",
      "Inconsistent xattr state",
      "Lack of proper checks for data fitting during xattr replacement"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can bypass intended ACL settings and potentially gain privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local users performing standard filesystem operations on Btrfs.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local user access to a system with a vulnerable Btrfs implementation."
  }
