The provided content contains information about **two** distinct vulnerabilities affecting the PTC IsoView ActiveX control, both assigned the same CVE ID: CVE-2014-9267. This is likely due to a misconfiguration or error during the assignment of CVE IDs. I will summarize both.

**Vulnerability 1 (ZDI-14-398):**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of arguments to animation-related methods within the IsoView ActiveX control
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution in the context of the browser
*   **Attack vector:** Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious webpage or file that includes an overly long object identifier to trigger the stack buffer overflow. User interaction is required to visit the malicious content.

**Vulnerability 2 (ZDI-14-399):**

*   **Root cause:** Heap buffer overflow
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of the "ViewPort" property within the IsoView ActiveX control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution in the context of the browser.
*   **Attack vector:** Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker must craft a malicious webpage or file that sets the ViewPort property to a malicious value to trigger the heap buffer overflow. User interaction is required to visit the malicious content.

Both vulnerabilities require user interaction to be exploited and allow for remote code execution.
