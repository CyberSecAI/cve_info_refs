Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-9835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

-   A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of WPG (WordPerfect Graphics) files within ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   Heap overflow: The software improperly handles the size of data when processing a WPG file, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Code execution: A successful heap overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical data structures on the heap.
-   Denial of service: If the overflow is not controlled, it can lead to a crash of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

-   Malicious file: By crafting a specially designed WPG file, an attacker can trigger the heap overflow when the file is processed by ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious WPG file to ImageMagick. This could be done by directly processing the file or by causing it to be processed through another application that uses ImageMagick to handle image files.
