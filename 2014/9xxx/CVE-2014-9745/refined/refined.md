{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `parse_encoding` function in `type1/t1load.c` doesn't properly handle a broken number-with-base, leading to an infinite loop.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Infinite loop due to improper handling of malformed input.",
        "Use of uninitialized data."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash or hang) due to the infinite loop, possibly exposing uninitialized memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted font file with a broken number-with-base in the PostScript stream.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker able to trick a user into using a malicious font file."
