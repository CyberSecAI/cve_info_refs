Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ajaxinit()` function within the `wpmarketplace/libs/cart.php` file of the WordPress Marketplace plugin. This function directly uses user-supplied input ($_POST['execute']) in a `call_user_func()` call without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted Function Call:** The `call_user_func($_POST['execute'],$_POST)` allows an attacker to call arbitrary PHP functions with attacker-controlled parameters.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There is no check on the `$_POST['execute']` parameter.
- **Direct use of user controlled data in `call_user_func`:** The `call_user_func` function directly uses user-controlled data `$_POST['execute']`.
- **Vulnerable Action:** The `wpmp_pp_ajax_call` action is accessible to any user from any post/page via a WordPress hook, making exploitation easy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP functions, effectively achieving remote code execution on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In the provided example, the attacker exploits this vulnerability to add a new WordPress administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Exploited Parameters:** The key parameters are `action` set to `wpmp_pp_ajax_call`, `execute` set to the desired PHP function (e.g. `wp_insert_user`), and parameters specific to the targeted function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit script demonstrates how to create a new administrator user using the vulnerable function.
- The script mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Kacper Szurek and exploited by Claudio Viviani.
- The vulnerability affects WordPress Marketplace plugin version 2.4.0.
