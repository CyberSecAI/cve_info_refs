Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability addressed by CVE-2014-9507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stemmed from the ability of users to change the content model of pages in other users' user space, specifically to CSS or JavaScript.
- When `$wgContentHandlerUseDB` was enabled, the content model of user subpages was no longer solely determined by the `.js` or `.css` file extension. This allowed users to change the content model of a page to JavaScript or CSS, even if they did not have the 'edituserjs' or 'editusercss' rights.
- The permission checks for editing user CSS/JS pages were insufficient, as they were not considering both the old and new content models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Bypassing Access Controls:** Unprivileged users could modify the content model of other users' pages to CSS or JavaScript, effectively granting them the ability to inject malicious code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By altering the content model of a page to Javascript, an attacker could inject and execute malicious code in the context of another user's session.
- **Vandalism:** Malicious users could mass-change user pages' content models, leading to broken pages that only the owner or an admin could fix.
- **Silent Disabling:**  Changing the content model of a user's JS/CSS page to something else (like wikitext) could silently disable the functionality of those pages if ResourceLoader ignored them, or lead to those pages being editable by anyone.
- **Exploitation of Accident:** If a user accidentally changed their `common.js` to a different content model (e.g. wikitext), a malicious user could then add arbitrary code to it and then change it back to a JavaScript content model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
- **Page Defacement/Disruption:** Users could deface or break the functionality of other users' user pages.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By mass-modifying pages, attackers could disrupt the site's functionality and require administrator intervention to correct the changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Manipulation:** The primary attack vector was through the MediaWiki API, which allowed modification of the content model parameter.
- **Web UI Exploitation:**  The web UI was also vulnerable, as hidden `model` and `format` fields could be modified using client-side JavaScript (e.g., through the browser's JS console) to change the content model when saving.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be an authenticated user of the MediaWiki instance.
- **Basic API Usage:** The attacker needed the ability to use the MediaWiki API to send requests that modified page properties.
- **Client-side JS manipulation:** Ability to modify hidden fields of the web UI using browser's JS console

**Mitigation:**

- The primary fix was to add a new user right, `editcontentmodel`, and require this right to change the content model of a page.
- Permission checks were updated to consider both the old and new content models during page edits.
- Code was modified to correctly check permissions for CSS and JavaScript subpages.
- The permission check was moved to `EditPage` to ensure that the hidden fields in the web UI were also covered
