Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in the `substring-index[-ci]` procedures of the `data-structures` unit within the CHICKEN Scheme compiler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `substring-index[-ci]` functions did not properly handle the optional `START` argument when it was an integer greater than zero, leading to a buffer overrun.
- There was a missing range check for the start index argument.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the vulnerable CHICKEN code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing a crafted integer greater than zero as the optional `START` argument to `substring-index[-ci]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to CHICKEN code that calls the vulnerable `substring-index[-ci]` functions with a malicious `START` argument. This could be through a remotely accessible service using the library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in CHICKEN versions 4.9.0.2, 4.9.1, and 5.0, and was patched in master (25db851) and chicken-5 (63d0445).
- The vulnerability affects all versions of CHICKEN prior to the fixes.
- A patch was created to fix the issue. The patch includes a range check for the start index argument.
- The provided Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201612-54) mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
