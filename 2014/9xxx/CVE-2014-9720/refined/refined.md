Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Tornado (a Python web framework) generated Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) tokens. The XSRF tokens were included in HTTP responses as cookies and were vulnerable to BREACH attack when used in conjunction with gzip compression.  The tokens were static and predictable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Predictable XSRF tokens:** The XSRF tokens were not masked and were predictable, allowing attackers to exploit the BREACH vulnerability.
*   **Exposure in compressed responses:** When gzip compression was used (either via the Tornado framework itself or by a proxy), the static XSRF tokens exposed sensitive information due to the BREACH attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of XSRF tokens:** An attacker could potentially recover XSRF tokens by observing the length of the compressed responses.
*   **Cross-site request forgery:** Once the XSRF token is recovered, an attacker can forge requests on behalf of the victim user and perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and observe the encrypted and compressed network traffic between the client and server.
*   **Injection of known text:** The attacker injects known text into the request before the XSRF token, to then observe the length of the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic.
*   **Ability to inject data:** The attacker needs to be able to inject known data into an HTTP request.
*   **Understanding of compression:** The attacker needs to understand how compression algorithms work and how they react to repeated data.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Tornado version 3.2.2 by masking the XSRF token with a random salt on each request.
*   The fix involves XORing the token with a random mask using the WebSocket masking function, which prevents BREACH attacks by ensuring the compressed content changes on each request.
*   The fix changes the format of the XSRF cookie. A transitional setting `xsrf_cookie_version=1` was available for applications running mixed versions of Tornado, allowing them to use the older cookie format while newer versions were deployed.
