The provided content includes four different vulnerabilities, all related to SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider, and all assigned the same CVE ID CVE-2014-9264. This is likely due to the vendor addressing multiple issues in the same patch.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap overflow in the handling of the `SPACE` function within SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider.
*   **Weakness:** An arithmetic truncation error can occur when processing the length argument of the `SPACE` function, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
*   **Attack vector:** Passing untrusted input as the length of a `SPACE` function in a query.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide input to an application using SAP SQL Anywhere and control the length of the `SPACE` function.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap overflow in the handling of the `REPLICATE` function within SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider.
*   **Weakness:** An arithmetic truncation error can occur when processing the length argument of the `REPLICATE` function, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
*   **Attack vector:** Passing untrusted input as the length of a `REPLICATE` function in a query.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide input to an application using SAP SQL Anywhere and control the length of the `REPLICATE` function.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow due to malformed integer constant handling within SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider.
*   **Weakness:**  A malformed integer constant used in a query can overflow a fixed-size stack buffer.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
*   **Attack vector:** Passing untrusted input as a malformed integer constant in a query.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide input to an application using SAP SQL Anywhere and control malformed integer constant in a query.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the handling of column aliases within SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider.
*   **Weakness:** A column alias with excessive length can overflow a fixed-size stack buffer.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
*   **Attack vector:** Passing untrusted input as the column alias in a query.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide input to an application using SAP SQL Anywhere and control the length of column aliases in a query.

In all four cases, even if the input is filtered against SQL injection, the vulnerabilities can still be exploited. These are not SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
