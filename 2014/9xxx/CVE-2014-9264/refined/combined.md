# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2014
## SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider SPACE Function Heap Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-14-413ZDI-CAN-2350

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-9264](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-9264) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.5, [AV:U/AC:M/Au:U/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:U/AC:M/Au:U/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [SAP](http://www.sap.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [SQL Anywhere](http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/sqlanywhere) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on applications which pass user provided data to the vulnerable API in SAP SQL Anywhere.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the SPACE function. If an application allows untrusted input to be used as the length of a SPACE function in a query, even if the input is correctly filtered against SQL injection, an attacker could take advantage of an arithmetic truncation error to overflow a heap buffer and execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | SAP released Security Note 2057277 (<http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-8218>) to address this issue. |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2014-04-06 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2014-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## SAP SQL Anywhere .NET Data Provider Malformed Integer Stack Buffer Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-14-415ZDI-CAN-2349

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-9264](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-9264) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.5, [AV:U/AC:L/Au:U/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:U/AC:L/Au:U/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [SAP](http://www.sap.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [SQL Anywhere](http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/sqlanywhere) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on applications which pass user provided data to the vulnerable API in SAP SQL Anywhere.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of a malformed integer constant. If an application allows untrusted input to be used in a query, even if the input is correctly filtered against SQL injection, an attacker could overflow a fixed size stack buffer and execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | SAP released Security Note 2057277 (<http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-8218>) to address this issue. |
