# RHSA-2015:0838 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: openstack-glance security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0838)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.
Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running
quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A storage quota bypass flaw was found in OpenStack Image (glance). If an
image was deleted while it was being uploaded, it would not count towards a
user's quota. A malicious user could use this flaw to deliberately fill the
backing store, and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9623)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Tushar Patil of NTT as the original reporter.

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1203227)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.
Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running
quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A storage quota bypass flaw was found in OpenStack Image (glance). If an
image was deleted while it was being uploaded, it would not count towards a
user's quota. A malicious user could use this flaw to deliberately fill the
backing store, and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9623)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Tushar Patil of NTT as the original reporter.

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1203275)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

The image data in /var/lib/glance/images/ cannot be removed when I delete a image that status is saving.

1. create a image

 glance image-create --name image-v1 --disk-format raw --container-format bare --file xx.image --is-public true

2. list the created image, the status is saving

[root@node2 ~]# glance image-list

+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

| ID | Name | Disk Format | Container Format | Size | Status |

+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

+--------------------------------------+----------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

3. delete the created image

glance image-delete image-v1

4. the image has been deleted but the image data still exists

[root@node2 ~]# glance image-list

+----+------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

| ID | Name | Disk Format | Container Format | Size | Status |

+----+------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

+----+------+-------------+------------------+------+--------+

[root@node2 ~]# ls /var/lib/glance/images

00ec3d8d-41a5-4f7c-9448-694099a39bcf

I remain dubious of the benefit of switching this bug to private after it was public (and for over a month at that).

The key reason is that currently glance can receives new image location and save it to database only after its bits saving logic return (affect by glance and glance\_store logics). So before upload execution 'thread' finish, glance doesn't know any location information of that 'saving' image, so delete 'thread' just think theres' no any locations/bits of the image need to remove. Figuring out solution.

Thanks zhiyan.

Sounds like we need to save the location earlier, ie before we start writing the bits. Would that be possible?

Hi Stuart,

Yes, it's a sensible solution, I'm thinking the details of this approach to make sure it's a best solution for this defect, it has some costs, e.g. how to get and handle these 'placeholder'/earlier location, and a little concerned on if this way can keep backward-compatible for glance code and client, e.g. not sure glance existing logics check image status instead of len(image.locations), outside as well, e.g. to make sure image under 'active' status before consume location data from metadata.

Thanks.

Hmm, it's tricky because when the image is in the deleted state any access to the registry from the api using the user's context (ie token) will return a 404 for the user.

Also, coordinating between an upload being processed on one api node and a delete coming in from another is tricky.

The upload won't be checking the database state so won't immediately detect that the image has been deleted.

I don't think we can disallow deleting images in a saving state either, because they could end up in a saving state eg if the upload node crashes.

It's almost like we need a form of opportunistic scrubbing even when delayed delete is not enabled.

Cleanup chunks for deleted image that was 'saving'

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that

    is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was

    deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we

    cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of

    v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload

    process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed

    v2: 410 Gone

Tushar Patil reported that [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1383973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1383973) can be leverage to conduct a denial of service attack on Glance backend store.

The image in saving state is not taken into account by global quota enforcement.

Attached is a script to reproduce the behavior:

Steps to reproduce (tested on file backend store)

1. Check how many images are present in the directory that the Filesystem backend store write the image data to (filesystem\_store\_datadir parameter).

  2. Run the program for 1 hour

  3. Again count images (step 1), it should be the same as recorded in Step 1.

We ran this program for 1 hour in our environment.

Before running the program, count of images in the file store (/opt/stack/data/glance/images) was 6.

After running the program for 1 hr,

\* Total count of images in the folder /opt/stack/data/glance/images = 806 (it should have been 6)

  \* Total count of images created = 1014

  \* Total count of images deleted in saving state = 800

  \* Total count of images deleted = 1014

Considering the bug is already public, fix should be proposed directly on gerrit, this new report will let us work on the impact statement and coordinate the security work in parallel to the public fix being merged.

I see [bug 1383973](/bugs/1383973) was switched to private security after being public for more than a month. Is the intent to mark one as a duplicate of the other?

@fungi Yes the idea would have been to discuss security implication here as [bug 1383973](/bugs/1383973) didn't have any security tags on it.

Also the former bug lack a description that the behavior overcome quotas settings...

Just to clarify, are we talking about this quota setting?

# Set a system wide quota for every user. This value is the total number

 # of bytes that a user can use across all storage systems. A value of

 #user\_storage\_quota = 0

@Stuart: yes, the attack is not mitigated by this setting.

I guess the reasoning is that most likely vulnerable setups would have set this value and it won't protect against this attack.

Anyone else get the reproducer to work on juno?

I had to go back to grizzly to get copy-from to work for me.

Any one else had success with copy-from on a later code base?

Based on zhiyan's update to [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1383973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1383973) the underlying inability to delete the bits of an image in a saving state still exists.

Hi,

I have done some testing using attached program by admin and normal user(demo).

In case of admin user, if image is deleted while it is in saving state, image data doesn't get deleted even after data is completely uploaded to the backend.

In case of normal user, if image is deleted while it is in saving state, data gets deleted after image upload completes.

In this case once upload is completed it tries to update the image meta-data, but as image is already deleted it raises ImageNotFound exception and cleans the data for that image from the backend.

user\_storage\_quota is not considered in the above case as the image is deleted. user\_storage\_quota doesn't considered 'deleted' or 'killed' images for checking the quota size. So if the image is deleted while the uploading is processing and user tries to add new image, the user\_storage\_quota will not consider the previous image size as it's status is deleted and doesn't throw 'StorageQuotaFull' exception even if quota size is exceeding.

IMO, image deletion should not be allowed when the image is in saving state.

Please let me know your opinion on the same.

Thanks Abhishek's analysis.

>>> IMO, image deletion should not be allowed when the image is in saving state.

IMO, seems it's a easiest solution as to make a limitation/checking on api level for end user. However I'm a little worried if it reduces usability from end user's perspective. And more, from some cross-project cases, image could dead on 'saving' status, e.g. Nova capture image failed/hang on upload step, then end user or client code e.g. Nova, need a way to delete the dead image from Glance.

OK, my understanding is that this is a valid vulnerability, even if the user is not an admin. Let me know if I got it wrong.

Considering the former report does not apply to normal user (see comment #9), the severity is lower than expected: The quota is overran only until the upload is completed and images are cleaned after.

I also did not consider malicious administrator.

Here is impact description draft #1

Title: Glance user storage quota bypass

Reporter: Tushar Patil (NTT)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user\_storage\_quota are affected.

Oh, I see where the bug description could have been misinterpreted--the expectation on this particular issue (since there's a corresponding public bug which doesn't mention any security implications) was that it could be fixed in public without discussing this private bug report. However the commit message unfortunately mentions both bug numbers rather than just the public bug.

Reviewers who see that bug number and attempt to view the resultant bug report will get a message which says "...you may not have permission to see it..." which is generally known to indicate a private bug (especially if they check that the next bug number following it is already allocated). This is then a hint to more closely scrutinize the review and the other public bug report for an indication of why it might indicate a vulnerable condition.

It's not a disaster, just an indication that we should perhaps go ahead and switch this bug to public as well so as to avoid any further confusion.

Cleanup chunks for deleted image that was 'saving'

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that

    is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was

    deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we

    cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of

    v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload

    process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed

    v2: 410 Gone

commit 7d5d8657fd70b20518610b3c6f8e41e16c72fa31

Author: Zhi Yan Liu <email address hidden>

Date: Tue Dec 30 22:25:50 2014 +0800

Cleanup chunks for deleted image that was 'saving'

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that

    is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was

    deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we

    cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of

    v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload

    process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed

    v2: 410 Gone

Subject: Re: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Glance

> A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
> ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
> attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an
> advisory was not sent yet.
>
> Title: Glance user storage quota bypass
> Reporter: Tushar Patil (NTT)
> Products: Glance
> Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1
>
> Description:
> Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images
> that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and
> thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into
> account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is
> completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are
> affected.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0644)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

A storage quota bypass flaw was found in OpenStack Image (glance). If an
image was deleted while it was being uploaded, it would not count towards a
user's quota. A malicious user could use this flaw to deliberately fill the
backing store, and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-9623)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Tushar Patil of NTT as the original reporter.

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1188390)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are affected.

### Bug Description

Tushar Patil reported that [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1383973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1383973) can be leverage to conduct a denial of service attack on Glance backend store.

The image in saving state is not taken into account by global quota enforcement.

Attached is a script to reproduce the behavior:

Steps to reproduce (tested on file backend store)

1. Check how many images are present in the directory that the Filesystem backend store write the image data to (filesystem\_store\_datadir parameter).

  2. Run the program for 1 hour

  3. Again count images (step 1), it should be the same as recorded in Step 1.

We ran this program for 1 hour in our environment.

Before running the program, count of images in the file store (/opt/stack/data/glance/images) was 6.

After running the program for 1 hr,

\* Total count of images in the folder /opt/stack/data/glance/images = 806 (it should have been 6)

  \* Total count of images created = 1014

  \* Total count of images deleted in saving state = 800

  \* Total count of images deleted = 1014

Considering the bug is already public, fix should be proposed directly on gerrit, this new report will let us work on the impact statement and coordinate the security work in parallel to the public fix being merged.

I see [bug 1383973](/bugs/1383973) was switched to private security after being public for more than a month. Is the intent to mark one as a duplicate of the other?

@fungi Yes the idea would have been to discuss security implication here as [bug 1383973](/bugs/1383973) didn't have any security tags on it.

Also the former bug lack a description that the behavior overcome quotas settings...

Just to clarify, are we talking about this quota setting?

# Set a system wide quota for every user. This value is the total number

@Stuart: yes, the attack is not mitigated by this setting.

I guess the reasoning is that most likely vulnerable setups would have set this value and it won't protect against this attack.

looks like an issue with copy-from.

I'm using juno stable code.

Anyone else get the reproducer to work on juno?

I had to go back to grizzly to get copy-from to work for me.

Any one else had success with copy-from on a later code base?

Based on zhiyan's update to [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1383973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1383973) the underlying inability to delete the bits of an image in a saving state still exists.

Hi,

I have done some testing using attached program by admin and normal user(demo).

In case of admin user, if image is deleted while it is in saving state, image data doesn't get deleted even after data is completely uploaded to the backend.

In case of normal user, if image is deleted while it is in saving state, data gets deleted after image upload completes.

In this case once upload is completed it tries to update the image meta-data, but as image is already deleted it raises ImageNotFound exception and cleans the data for that image from the backend.

user\_storage\_quota is not considered in the above case as the image is deleted. user\_storage\_quota doesn't considered 'deleted' or 'killed' images for checking the quota size. So if the image is deleted while the uploading is processing and user tries to add new image, the user\_storage\_quota will not consider the previous image size as it's status is deleted and doesn't throw 'StorageQuotaFull' exception even if quota size is exceeding.

IMO, image deletion should not be allowed when the image is in saving state.

Please let me know your opinion on the same.

Thanks Abhishek's analysis.

>>> IMO, image deletion should not be allowed when the image is in saving state.

IMO, seems it's a easiest solution as to make a limitation/checking on api level for end user. However I'm a little worried if it reduces usability from end user's perspective. And more, from some cross-project cases, image could dead on 'saving' status, e.g. Nova capture image failed/hang on upload step, then end user or client code e.g. Nova, need a way to delete the dead image from Glance.

OK, my understanding is that this is a valid vulnerability, even if the user is not an admin. Let me know if I got it wrong.

Considering the former report does not apply to normal user (see comment #9), the severity is lower than expected: The quota is overran only until the upload is completed and images are cleaned after.

I also did not consider malicious administrator.

Here is impact description draft #1

Title: Glance user storage quota bypass

Reporter: Tushar Patil (NTT)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user\_storage\_quota are affected.

Oh, I see where the bug description could have been misinterpreted--the expectation on this particular issue (since there's a corresponding public bug which doesn't mention any security implications) was that it could be fixed in public without discussing this private bug report. However the commit message unfortunately mentions both bug numbers rather than just the public bug.

Re @fungi, about bug number mentioning within patch's commit message, I think it's not a big deal due to this report is under private status, improper users couldn't even know the background and deeper affect from security perspective.

Reviewers who see that bug number and attempt to view the resultant bug report will get a message which says "...you may not have permission to see it..." which is generally known to indicate a private bug (especially if they check that the next bug number following it is already allocated). This is then a hint to more closely scrutinize the review and the other public bug report for an indication of why it might indicate a vulnerable condition.

It's not a disaster, just an indication that we should perhaps go ahead and switch this bug to public as well so as to avoid any further confusion.

Cleanup chunks for deleted image that was 'saving'

Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that

    is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is

    completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.

This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was

    deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we

    cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.

This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of

    v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload

    process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:

v1: 412 Precondition Failed

    v2: 410 Gone

Cleanup chunks for deleted image that was 'saving'
Currently image data cannot be removed synchronously for an image that
is in saving state. And when, the upload operation for such an image is
completed the operator configured quota can be exceeded.
This patch fixes the issue of left over chunks for an image which was
deleted from saving status. However, by the limitation of the design we
cannot enforce a global quota check for the image in saving status.
This change introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of
v1 and v2 APIs. The status codes which we will now see after the upload
process completes on an image which was deleted mid way are:
v1: 412 Precondition Failed
v2: 410 Gone

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-19 11:49:10 UTC  ``` Title: Glance user storage quota bypass Reporter: Tushar Patil (NTT) Products: Glance Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1  Description: Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user_storage_quota are affected.  References: <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1398830>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Tushar Patil of NTT as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-23 20:18:52 UTC  ``` Patches:  Kilo (development branch) fix: <https://review.openstack.org/144464>  Juno fix: <https://review.openstack.org/149387>  Icehouse fix: <https://review.openstack.org/149646>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c9)  Flavio Percoco    2015-01-29 14:48:57 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1117677](show_bug.cgi?id=1117677 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - glance image-delete on an image with the status \"saving\" doesn't delete the image's file from store") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 19:30:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:0644 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0644.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 13:58:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 5 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1183647#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 15:09:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2015:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0838.html>   ``` |  |

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# OSSA-2015-003: Glance user storage quota bypass

# OSSA-2015-003: Glance user storage quota bypass[Â¶](#ossa-2015-003-glance-user-storage-quota-bypass "Link to this heading")

Date:

January 26, 2015

CVE:

CVE-2014-9623

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Glance: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted state are not taken into account by quota and wonât be effectively deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured with user\_storage\_quota are affected.
