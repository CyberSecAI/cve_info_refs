Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9623:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly refers to CVE-2014-9623 and describes a vulnerability in OpenStack Glance related to storage quota bypass, which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   A storage quota bypass flaw exists in OpenStack Image (Glance).
    *   If an image is deleted while it is being uploaded (in a "saving" state), the space it occupies is not correctly accounted for in the user's storage quota. The quota is not enforced until the upload is completed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of image deletion during upload processes.
    *   Lack of consistent quota enforcement for images in the "saving" state.
    *   The system fails to remove image data immediately when an image in "saving" status is deleted.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A malicious user can exploit this flaw to deliberately fill the backing store, bypassing the configured user storage quota.
    *   This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the excessive consumption of storage resources.
    *   In some cases, normal users are affected as well, not just admin users.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
     * Remote. An attacker can leverage the Glance API to upload images and delete them during the upload process
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker requires the ability to create and delete images using the OpenStack Glance API, and a configured user quota. They do not require administrative access.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   The vulnerability is present in OpenStack Glance versions up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1
    *   The vulnerability can lead to a state where the storage used exceeds the user quota

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The reports mention that the fix was backported to the `stable/juno` and `stable/icehouse` branches.
*   The fix involves cleaning up "chunks" of data from deleted images that were in the 'saving' status, and introduces a inconsonance between http response codes of v1 and v2 APIs in such cases.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2015:0644, RHSA-2015:0837, RHSA-2015:0838) address this vulnerability for different versions of Red Hat OpenStack.
*   The fix for this issue will introduce a change of the http response codes, where
    * v1 returns a 412 (Precondition Failed)
    * v2 returns a 410 (Gone)

In summary, CVE-2014-9623 describes a quota bypass vulnerability in OpenStack Glance that can lead to a denial-of-service by allowing a malicious user to consume excessive storage by manipulating the image upload process.
