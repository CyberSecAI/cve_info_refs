    "CVE": "CVE-2014-9721",
    "description": "libzmq before 4.0.6 and 4.1.x before 4.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and bypass ZMTP v3 protocol security mechanisms via a ZMTP v2 or earlier header.",
    "affected_component": "libzmq",
    "root_cause": "The libzmq library is susceptible to a protocol downgrade attack when using the ZMTP v3 protocol. It fails to enforce the use of ZMTP v3 security mechanisms and allows connections using ZMTP v2 or earlier headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Protocol Downgrade Vulnerability",
      "Insufficient protocol version enforcement",
      "Bypass of security mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass ZMTP v3 security mechanisms by downgrading the connection to ZMTP v2 or earlier, potentially allowing for unauthorized access or manipulation of data transmitted through the affected sockets.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker able to send network packets to a service using libzmq. No authentication is needed for the attack",
