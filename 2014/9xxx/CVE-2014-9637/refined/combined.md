## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

## Details

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle file paths in

patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could

overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-4651](/security/CVE-2010-4651))

László Böszörményi discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle some

patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-9637](/security/CVE-2014-9637))

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle symbolic links in

git style patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that

could overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2015-1196](/security/CVE-2015-1196))

Jakub Wilk discovered that GNU patch did not correctly handle file renames in

git style patch files. An attacker could specially craft a patch file that

could overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2015-1395](/security/CVE-2015-1395))

Jakub Wilk discovered the fix for [CVE-2015-1196](/security/CVE-2015-1196) was incomplete for GNU patch.

An attacker could specially craft a patch file that could overwrite arbitrary

files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2015-1396](/security/CVE-2015-1396))

## Updated patch packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 17 Feb 2015

Modification date: 17 Feb 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-9637](CVE-2014-9637.html)
,
[CVE-2015-1196](CVE-2015-1196.html)
,
[CVE-2015-1395](CVE-2015-1395.html)

## Description

```
Updated patch package fixes security vulnerabilities:

It was reported that a crafted diff file can make patch eat memory and later
segfault (CVE-2014-9637).

It was reported that the versions of the patch utility that support Git-style
patches are vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw. This could allow an
attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by applying a specially crafted patch,
with the privileges of the user running patch (CVE-2015-1395).

GNU patch before 2.7.4 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via
a symlink attack in a patch file (CVE-2015-1196).
