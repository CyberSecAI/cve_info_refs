Subject: CVE Request, Use after free vulnerability in Dwarfdump

Hi,

we report a vulnerability in DwarfDump which is shipped
with every release of the SGI MIPS/IRIX C compiler.
we have reported the issue to vendor and linux Bugzilla:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177758>

the details as follows:

Advisory: Use after free vulnerability in Dwarfdump.
Advisory ID: -
Author : Qixue Xiao , Tao He
Affected Sofware:  dwarf-20130126 -- dwarf-20140805 (tested)
Vendor URL: <http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html>
Vendor Status:  reported
CVE-ID : -

================================
Vulnerability Description:
================================

There is a UAF(used after free) in  dwarf-20130126 and dwarf-20140805, and we have tested the two version, so we guess the versions which are between them will be affected too.
when an odd elf file passed to dwarfdump, it would use an object which have be freed before.

=========================================
Details:
==========================================

if an elf file is passed to dwarfdump, 'dwarf_elf_init' will be called and the 'Dwarf_Debug' object will be free in 'dwarf_elf_object_access_finish',  if the elf file is not in correct format.

--------------------------------
res = dwarf_object_init(binary_interface, errhand, errarg,
        ret_dbg, error);
    if (res != DW_DLV_OK){
        dwarf_elf_object_access_finish(binary_interface);
    }
--------------------------------

And the object will be refered again in 'print_error' :

--------------------------
    if (obj->object) {
        dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *internals =
            (dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *)obj->object;
--------------------------

when debugging it with gdb, the error information as follows:

--------------------------------
/home/xqx/test/dwarf_test/dwarf-20140805/dwarfdump/dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_elf_init:  DW_DLE_ELF_STRPTR_ERROR 30 a
call to elf_strptr() failed trying to get a section name (30)

CU Name =
CU Producer =
DIE OFF = 0x00000000 GOFF = 0x00000000, Low PC = 0x00000000, High PC = 0x00000000

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000436305 in dwarf_finish (dbg=0x1, error=0x7fffffffe030) at dwarf_original_elf_init.c:193
193         dwarf_elf_object_access_finish(dbg->de_obj_file);
-----------------------------------------------

====================
Status:
=====================

We have sent email to libdwarf-list@...thlink.net to report it.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  dwarf-20130126 and dwarf-20140805 were tested.  How reproducible:  run : dwarfdump a.out   Actual results: when debugging it with gdb, the error information as follows:  -------------------------------- /home/xqx/test/dwarf_test/dwarf-20140805/dwarfdump/dwarfdump ERROR:  dwarf_elf_init:  DW_DLE_ELF_STRPTR_ERROR 30 a  call to elf_strptr() failed trying to get a section name (30)  CU Name =  CU Producer =  DIE OFF = 0x00000000 GOFF = 0x00000000, Low PC = 0x00000000, High PC = 0x00000000  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x0000000000436305 in dwarf_finish (dbg=0x1, error=0x7fffffffe030) at dwarf_original_elf_init.c:193 193         dwarf_elf_object_access_finish(dbg->de_obj_file); -----------------------------------------------   Expected results:    Additional info: ========================================= Details:  ==========================================   if an elf file is passed to dwarfdump, 'dwarf_elf_init' will be called and the 'Dwarf_Debug' object will be free in 'dwarf_elf_object_access_finish',  if the elf file is not in correct format.  -------------------------------- res = dwarf_object_init(binary_interface, errhand, errarg,         ret_dbg, error);     if (res != DW_DLV_OK){         dwarf_elf_object_access_finish(binary_interface);     } --------------------------------  And the object will be refered again in 'print_error' :  --------------------------     if (obj->object) {         dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *internals =             (dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *)obj->object; --------------------------  ==================== Status: =====================  We have sent email to libdwarf-list to report it.   ================== references: ==================  <http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c1)  Tom Hughes    2014-12-30 10:02:21 UTC  ``` Can you clarify something - is this an issue in the libdwarf library? or in the dwarfdump tool?

If it's in the tool then is it dwarfdump or dwarfdump2 > (or both)?  It is in dwarfdump, but the Segmentation fault caused in dwarf_original_elf_init.c which is a file in libdwarf library. And It is not in dwarfdump2.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c3)  Tom Hughes    2014-12-30 13:46:20 UTC  ``` Right, the actual crash is in the library, but is it caused by a bug in the library or by dwarfdump misusing the library? That's what I'm trying to figure out...  If it is in dwarfdump then Fedora is not affected, as we actually ship dwarfdump2 as dwarfdump currently.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c4)  Tom Hughes    2015-01-05 12:17:56 UTC  ``` To answer my own question, it seems that this in fact effect dwarfdump2 (which we ship as dwarfdump) as valgrind reports two read after free errors:  ==24438== Invalid read of size 8 ==24438==    at 0x3D9B20DB55: dwarf_errmsg (dwarf_error.c:437 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x40E917: print_error_and_continue(Dwarf_Debug_s*, std::string const&, int, Dwarf_Error_s*) (dwarfdump.cc:1876 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40EB38: print_error(Dwarf_Debug_s*, std::string const&, int, Dwarf_Error_s*) (dwarfdump.cc:1862 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x412026: process_one_file(Elf*, std::string const&, int, dwconf_s*) [clone .constprop.133] (dwarfdump.cc:938 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40753F: main (dwarfdump.cc:388 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==  Address 0x62c6ce30 is 16 bytes inside a block of size 24 free'd ==24438==    at 0x62A5BE90: free (in /usr/lib64/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21E957: dwarf_tdestroy_inner.isra.2 (dwarf_tsearchhash.c:632 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21F346: _dwarf_tdestroy (dwarf_tsearchhash.c:665 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B20A94E: _dwarf_free_all_of_one_debug (dwarf_alloc.c:595 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B2156C3: dwarf_object_init (dwarf_init_finish.c:851 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21B2F6: dwarf_elf_init_file_ownership (dwarf_original_elf_init.c:173 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21B4E8: dwarf_elf_init (dwarf_original_elf_init.c:137 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x410054: process_one_file(Elf*, std::string const&, int, dwconf_s*) [clone .constprop.133] (dwarfdump.cc:932 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40753F: main (dwarfdump.cc:388 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump)  and:  ==24438== Invalid read of size 8 ==24438==    at 0x3D9B20DB35: dwarf_errno (dwarf_error.c:424 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x40E931: print_error_and_continue(Dwarf_Debug_s*, std::string const&, int, Dwarf_Error_s*) (dwarfdump.cc:1877 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40EB38: print_error(Dwarf_Debug_s*, std::string const&, int, Dwarf_Error_s*) (dwarfdump.cc:1862 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x412026: process_one_file(Elf*, std::string const&, int, dwconf_s*) [clone .constprop.133] (dwarfdump.cc:938 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40753F: main (dwarfdump.cc:388 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==  Address 0x62c6ce30 is 16 bytes inside a block of size 24 free'd ==24438==    at 0x62A5BE90: free (in /usr/lib64/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21E957: dwarf_tdestroy_inner.isra.2 (dwarf_tsearchhash.c:632 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21F346: _dwarf_tdestroy (dwarf_tsearchhash.c:665 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B20A94E: _dwarf_free_all_of_one_debug (dwarf_alloc.c:595 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B2156C3: dwarf_object_init (dwarf_init_finish.c:851 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21B2F6: dwarf_elf_init_file_ownership (dwarf_original_elf_init.c:173 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x3D9B21B4E8: dwarf_elf_init (dwarf_original_elf_init.c:137 in /usr/lib64/libdwarf.so.1.20140805.0) ==24438==    by 0x410054: process_one_file(Elf*, std::string const&, int, dwconf_s*) [clone .constprop.133] (dwarfdump.cc:932 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump) ==24438==    by 0x40753F: main (dwarfdump.cc:388 in /usr/bin/dwarfdump)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c5)  Tom Hughes    2015-01-05 12:27:05 UTC  ``` Switching back to dwarfdump (dwarfdump2 will be deprecated in the next release anyway) isn't going to help as it has exactly the same structure.  I'm inclined to this this is a library API problem - the dwarf_elf_init is returning DLV_ERROR but attempts to ask the library for details of the error are causing it to access freed memory. So I don't think the dwarfdump tools are doing anything wrong in the way they use the library.  Hopefully upstream will come up with something soon...   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c6)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-14 09:27:32 UTC  ``` libdwarf-20150112-1.fc21 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 21. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libdwarf-20150112-1.fc21>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758#c7)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-14 23:56:31 UTC  ``` Package libdwarf-20150112-1.fc21: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora 21 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days.

If dwarfdump is passed a corrupted ELF file, 'Dwarf_Debug' object will be freed in 'dwarf_elf_object_access_finish', but then this object is being referenced later in 'print_error':  -------------------------------- res = dwarf_object_init(binary_interface, errhand, errarg,         ret_dbg, error);     if (res != DW_DLV_OK){         dwarf_elf_object_access_finish(binary_interface);     } -------------------------------- ... --------------------------     if (obj->object) {         dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *internals =             (dwarf_elf_object_access_internals_t *)obj->object; --------------------------  [1]: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177758](show_bug.cgi?id=1177758 "CLOSED ERRATA - Use after free vulnerability in Dwarfdump.")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1178725#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-01-06 09:20:10 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-9482](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9482) to this issue: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/20>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1178725#c2)  Orion Poplawski    2015-01-24 04:06:28 UTC  ``` It appears to me that the EPEL6 version - 20140413 - is vulnerable to this as well.  I believe that upstream commit 9a2dfcfe020314672086e44bddd81c155cba2a6d is the primary fix for this, but it does not apply cleanly to 20140413.  I don't want to update to the latest release due to apparent ABI incompatibilities - see <http://upstream.rosalinux.ru/versions/libdwarf.html>   ``` |  |
