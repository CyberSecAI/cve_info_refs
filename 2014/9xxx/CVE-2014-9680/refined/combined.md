# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

You can, however, grab the sources from here:  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/pre-gnome2/sources/libgsf/libgsf-1.1.0.tar.bz2  More than likely, since it is a redhat project, the tarball should contain a spec file. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Spider (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-07-30 15:36:53 UTC  ``` thanks. will get on it when my buglist is smaller ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Gabriele Giorgetti    2002-08-05 20:15:10 UTC  ``` gnumeric 1.1.6 is now available in portage, still masked tought. libgsf has been added as well.  ``` |  |

arbitrary files or bypass security restrictions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/sudo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.12** |

### Background

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run
commands as other users. Access to commands may also be granted on a
range to hosts.

### Description

sudo does not handle the TZ environment variable properly.

### Impact

A local attacker may be able to read arbitrary files or information from
device special files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.8.12"

```

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1409)

## Topic

Updated sudo packages that fix one security issue, three bugs, and add one
enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system
administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute
privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes, without
having to log in as root.

It was discovered that sudo did not perform any checks of the TZ
environment variable value. If sudo was configured to preserve the TZ
environment variable, a local user with privileges to execute commands via
sudo could possibly use this flaw to achieve system state changes not
permitted by the configured commands. (CVE-2014-9680)

Note: The default sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux removes
the TZ variable from the environment in which commands run by sudo are
executed.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the sudo utility child processes could sometimes become

unresponsive because they ignored the SIGPIPE signal. With this update,
SIGPIPE handler is properly restored in the function that reads passwords
from the user, and the child processes no longer ignore SIGPIPE. As a
result, sudo child processes do not hang in this situation. (BZ#1094548)

* Prior to this update, the order in which sudo rules were processed did

not honor the user-defined sudoOrder attribute. Consequently, sudo rules
were processed in an undefined order even when the user defined the order
in sudoOrder. The implementation of SSSD support in sudo has been modified
to sort the rules according to the sudoOrder value, and sudo rules are now
sorted in the order defined by the user in sudoOrder. (BZ#1138581)

* Previously, sudo became unresponsive after the user issued a command when

a sudoers source was mentioned multiple times in the /etc/nsswitch.conf
file. The problem occurred when nsswitch.conf contained, for example, the
"sudoers: files sss sss" entry. The sudoers source processing code has been
fixed to correctly handle multiple instances of the same sudoers source.
As a result, sudo no longer hangs when a sudoers source is mentioned
multiple times in /etc/nsswitch.conf. (BZ#1147498)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* The sudo utility now supports I/O logs compressed using the zlib library.

With this update, sudo can generate zlib compressed I/O logs and also
process zlib compressed I/O logs generated by other versions of sudo with
zlib support. (BZ#1106433)

All sudo users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1191144#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-10 14:36:21 UTC  ``` sudo 1.8.12 will be released shortly [1] which includes sanity checks for the TZ environment variable.  This issue was previously discussed here:     <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/15/24>  There is an associated Debian bug:     <https://bugs.debian.org/772707>     From <http://www.sudo.ws/alerts/tz.html>   Summary:  Prior to sudo 1.8.12, the TZ environment variable was passed through unchecked.  Most libc tzset() implementations support passing an absolute pathname in the time zone to point to an arbitrary, user-controlled file.  This may be used to exploit bugs in the C library's TZ parser or open files the user would not otherwise have access to.  Arbitrary file access via TZ could also be used in a denial of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will block.  Beginning with sudo 1.8.12, TZ is only passed through by default if it is considered "safe".  The TZ variable is now considered "unsafe" if any of the following are true:      o   It consists of a fully-qualified path name that         does not match the location of the zoneinfo directory.      o   It contains a ".." path element.      o   It contains white space or non-printable characters.      o   It is longer than the value of PATH_MAX.  Sudo versions affected:  Sudo versions prior to 1.8.12 are affected.  Details:  Unix systems support a user-specified time zone value stored in the TZ environment variable.  On many systems, the value of TZ is ignored for set user ID processes (such as sudo) if it does not pass certain sanity checks.  However, while the value may be ignored, it is not actually removed from the environment.  As such, a program run via sudo will inherit the (possibly malicious) value of TZ.  A user with sudo access may take advantage of this to exploit bugs in the C library functions which parse the TZ environment variable. The TZ handling in most C libraries (including GNU libc and the tzcode used by BSD and others) supports reading arbitrary files.  By setting TZ to a fully-qualified path name, a command run via sudo may be used to read (but not disclose the contents of) files that the user would not otherwise be able to open.  This is generally benign for regular files, but it may be possible to change the behavior of the system by reading from device special files.  For instance, it may be possible to hijack the output from a terminal device file, consume kernel log messages or cause a tape drive to change position.  It may also be possible to cause a command run by sudo to hang if TZ is set to the value of a named pipe or a device special file that blocks on read.  Impact:  A user with sudo access may be able to exploit parsing bugs in the time zone parsing functions of the system's C library functions. The user may also be able to read arbitrary files, potentially causing changes in system behavior when reading certain device special files or simply causing the program run via sudo to block.  Fix:  The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.12.

The default configuration performs environment reset and does not keep TZ value.  Starting with sudo upstream version 1.6.9, environment handling was changed to reset environment by default:  <http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/file/dba251655c76/UPGRADE>  The env_reset was made the default in Fedora even earlier, in response to flaws as [CVE-2004-1051](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-1051), [CVE-2005-4158](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4158), and CVE-2006-0151:  <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2006-February/080598.html> <https://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/sudo.git/commit/?id=c5558ce>  This Fedora change was inherited by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later.  Until upstream versions 1.8.12 and 1.7.10p9, sudo included TZ variable in the env_keep list by default.  However, the sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later, and Fedora overrides that compiled-in upstream default by not including TZ in env_keep.  Hence the default configuration is not affected by this issue.  In affected configurations, this issue can be mitigated by ensuring that TZ environment setting is not preserved for commands executed by sudo.  In configurations that use env_reset but do not excluded TZ from env_keep (e.g. when env_keep is not used in sudoers at all and compiled-in default list including TZ is used), TZ can be removed from env_keep using sudoers directive:    Defaults env_keep -= "TZ"  In configurations that do not use env_reset (such as the default configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4), sudo can be configured to explicitly remote TZ from environment using sudoers directive:    Defaults env_delete += "TZ"  Where sudo is used to run specific commands without giving full shell access, it it recommended to use env_reset with a carefully selected list of variables to preserve rather than explicitly configure blacklist of variables to unset.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1191144#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-12 08:27:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the default sudo configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1191144#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 07:36:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1409 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1409.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1191144#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2016-03-09 21:03:07 UTC  ``` This issue was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via RHBA-2015:2424:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-2424.html>  Released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2.   ``` |  |

Subject: Abusing TZ for fun (and little profit)

By default, sudo preserves the TZ variable[1] from user's environment.
This is a bad idea on glibc systems, where TZ can be abused to trick the
program to read an arbitrary file. PoC:

$ echo moo > tz
$ chmod 0 tz
$ cat tz
cat: tz: Permission denied
$ TZ=$PWD/tz sudo -u root strace -e read date
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\300\233\1\0004\0\0\0"..., 512) = 512
read(3, "moo\n", 4096)                  = 4
read(3, "", 4096)                       = 0
Wed Oct 15 20:42:42  2014
+++ exited with 0 +++

Procmail is another program that recklessly whitelists TZ[2].

# Arbitrary file access via TZ environment variable

Feb 9, 2015

Prior to sudo 1.8.12, the `TZ` environment variable was passed through
unchecked. Most libc `tzset()` implementations support passing an
absolute pathname in the time zone to point to an arbitrary,
user-controlled file. This may be used to exploit bugs in the C
library’s `TZ` parser or open files the user would not otherwise have
access to. Arbitrary file access via `TZ` could also be used in a
denial of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will
block.

Beginning with sudo 1.8.12, `TZ` is only passed through by default
if it is considered *safe*.
The `TZ` variable is now considered *unsafe* if any of the following
are true:

* It consists of a fully-qualified path name, optionally
  prefixed with a colon (`:`), that does not match the
  location of the `zoneinfo` directory.
* It contains a `..` path element.
* It contains white space or non-printable characters.
* It is longer than the value of `PATH_MAX`.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo versions prior to 1.8.12 are affected.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2014-9680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9680)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

## Details:

Unix systems support a user-specified time zone value stored in the
`TZ` environment variable. On many systems, the value of `TZ` is ignored
for set user ID processes (such as sudo) if it does not pass certain
sanity checks. However, while the value may be ignored, it is not
actually removed from the environment. As such, a program run via
sudo will inherit the (possibly malicious) value of `TZ`.

A user with sudo access may take advantage of this to exploit bugs
in the C library functions which parse the `TZ` environment variable.
The `TZ` handling in most C libraries (including GNU libc and the
tzcode used by BSD and others) supports reading arbitrary files.

By setting `TZ` to a fully-qualified path name, a command run via
sudo may be used to read (but not disclose the contents of) files
that the user would not otherwise be able to open. This is generally
benign for regular files, but it may be possible to change the
behavior of the system by reading from device special files. For
instance, it may be possible to hijack the output from a terminal
device file, consume kernel log messages or cause a tape drive to
change position. It may also be possible to cause a command run
by sudo to hang if `TZ` is set to the value of a named pipe or a
device special file that blocks on read.

## Impact:

A user with sudo access may be able to exploit parsing bugs in the
time zone parsing functions of the system’s C library functions.
The user may also be able to read arbitrary files, potentially
causing changes in system behavior when reading certain device
special files or simply causing the program run via sudo to block.

## Fix:

The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.12 and 1.7.10p9.

## Credit:

Jakub Wilk began a discussion about abusing the `TZ` environment
variable on the oss-security mailing list.

Stephane Chazelas also reported the problem and supplied some
concrete examples of how it could be abused.
