  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sudo utility did not properly sanitize the TZ environment variable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unchecked environment variable",
      "Arbitrary file read"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially read arbitrary files or information from device special files, leading to system state changes not permitted by the configured commands. It could also potentially cause denial of service by reading from blocking files such as named pipes.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access by exploiting a vulnerability where sudo preserves the TZ environment variable.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute commands via sudo and the system should have sudo configured to preserve the TZ environment variable.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the TZ environment variable is not removed even when it's ignored due to failed sanity checks. This allows a program run via sudo to inherit the (possibly malicious) value of TZ. The TZ handling in many C libraries supports reading arbitrary files when TZ is set to a fully-qualified path name. Sudo versions prior to 1.8.12 are affected. The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring that TZ environment setting is not preserved for commands executed by sudo. The default sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux removes the TZ variable from the environment."
