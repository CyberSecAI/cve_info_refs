Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-9509:

**CVE-2014-9509 is not mentioned in the provided text.**

The provided content describes vulnerabilities associated with **TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-003** which was assigned **CVE-2014-9508** and one unassigned CVE.

**Vulnerability 1: Link Spoofing**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of anchor-only links on the homepage when `config.prefixLocalAnchors` is used, and `config.absRefPrefix` is not set. URL rewriting being enabled is a precondition.
*   **Weaknesses:** The system fails to properly validate and sanitize URL prefixes when generating anchor links on the homepage.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can forge a request to modify anchor links on the homepage to point to arbitrary domains, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities by redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker forges a request which modifies the anchor only links
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.

**Vulnerability 2: Cache Poisoning**

*   **Root Cause:** When the `config.prefixLocalAnchors` option is set to "all" or "cached", a request URL with arbitrary arguments pointing to the homepage can be cached.
*   **Weaknesses:** The caching mechanism doesn't properly normalize or sanitize URLs with added arguments, allowing the caching of URLs that should not be cached.
*   **Impact:** This results in unexpected behavior where clicking a section link leads to a full page reload instead of just jumping to the specified section on the page. This can negatively impact the user experience.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker forges a request which includes arbitrary arguments to the home page URL
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.

**Affected TYPO3 Versions:**

Both vulnerabilities affect versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.38, 4.6.0 to 4.6.18, 4.7.0 to 4.7.20, 6.0.0 to 6.0.14, 6.1.0 to 6.1.12, 6.2.0 to 6.2.8, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.1.

**Mitigation:**

*   For Link Spoofing: Set `config.absRefPrefix` to a suitable value or update to TYPO3 versions 4.5.39, 6.2.9, or 7.0.2.
*   For Cache Poisoning: Remove `config.prefixLocalAnchors` (and optionally `config.baseUrl`) and use `config.absRefPrefix` instead.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that the Link Spoofing vulnerability only affects TYPO3 versions 4.6.x and higher if the homepage is **not** a shortcut to a different page.
*   The document also notes that the URL rewriting must be enabled in the web server for the Link Spoofing vulnerability to be exploitable.

**CVE-2014-9508** is specifically mentioned in relation to the Link Spoofing vulnerability but the content includes details of a second unassigned CVE for cache poisoning.
