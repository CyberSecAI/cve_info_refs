| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1168146#c0)  Martin Prpič    2014-11-26 09:23:58 UTC  ``` It was found that when the UID and GID were changed in the <changeowner> section of the /etc/icecast.xml file, the supplementary groups were left in place. This could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges if the <changeowner> configuration was used.  The following fix was added to icecast version 2.4.0:  In case of <changeowner> only UID and GID were changed, supplementary groups were left in place. This is a potential security issue only if <changeowner> is used. New behaviour is to set UID, GID and set supplementary groups based on the UID Even in case of icecast remaining in supplementary group 0 this "only" gives it things like access to files that are owned by group 0 and according to their umask. This is obviously bad, but not as bad as UID 0 with all its other special rights. It's a security issue and we fix immediately and recommend users to update.

I think this icecast2 issue should also receive a CVE ID:
<https://trac.xiph.org/changeset/19137/>

### Icecast Release 2.4.0

We are pleased to announce release 2.4.0 of Icecast.
A summary of the changes is listed below, for details please
refer to the [ChangeLog](http://svn.xiph.org/icecast/tags/icecast-2.4.0/ChangeLog).

#### Downloads

* Source: [icecast-2.4.0.tar.gz](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/icecast/icecast-2.4.0.tar.gz)
* Windows [icecast\_win32\_2.4.0.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/icecast/icecast_win32_2.4.0.zip)

#### New features

* Support for Ogg Opus streams
* Support for WebM streams
* HTTP 1.1 PUT support for source connections. Deprecating SOURCE method.
* *Default mount*

  This allows you to define a global set of defaults for *all* mounts.
  This way you can use e.g. url-auth for sources and or listeners also for dynamically generated mounts.
* *Web interface redone*
  + Web output properly redone, credit to ePirat.
  + Added `<audio>` element for supported audio streams.
  + Now validates completely as XHTML1.0 strict.
  + Improves rendering on mobile devices.
* Added basic JSON API (`/status-json.xsl`) based on a xml2json template by Doeke Zanstra (see `xml2json.xslt`).
  Output is roughly limited to data also visible through `status.xsl`.
* Send charset in HTTP headers for everything, excluding file-serv and streams.
* Allow (standard `strftime(3)`) `%x` codes in `<dump-file>`. Disabled for win32.
* Added stream\_start\_iso8601, server\_start\_iso8601 to statitics. ISO8601 compliante timestamps for statistics.
  Should make usage in e.g. JSON much easier. Added as new variables to avoid breaking backwards compatibility.
* Now compiles for win32 using mingw
* Added options `headers` and `header_prefix` to URL based listener auth.
* Updated listener\_remove handler, added `ip=` and `agent=`
* Allow full URLs to be returned by the master server.

#### Fixes

* **Security Fix**: Override supplementary groups if `<changeowner>` is used
* Fixes for some race conditions
* Dropped debian packaging directory as debian use their own.
* Send proper HTTP headers in responses to clients.
* Corrected `Content-Length` header in admin (raw) requests. Thanks to paluh for reporting.
* Escape log entries in access log
* Fixed a memory leak. Lost headers of stream because of wrong ref counter in associated refbuf objects.
* Avoid memory leak in `_parse_mount()` when `type`-attribute is set
* Updated web interface to be XHTML compliant.
* Removed `status2.xsl` from release. It was only a broken example file anyway.

#### Known issues

* Will crash if certain config tags are left empty.
* Webinterface shows Login when using just `stream_auth`.
