Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When the UID and GID are changed using the `<changeowner>` section in the `/etc/icecast.xml` configuration file, the supplementary groups of the process are not updated. They are left as they were before the change of ownership.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete privilege dropping:** Icecast was not correctly updating the supplementary groups of the process when changing the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) using the `<changeowner>` directive.
- **Privilege escalation potential:** Leaving supplementary groups in place after changing the UID and GID can potentially lead to privilege escalation if the supplementary groups grant access to resources not intended for the new, less privileged user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially escalate privileges by exploiting the fact that supplementary groups are not updated after using `<changeowner>`.
- If a user changes to a less privileged user with `<changeowner>` but keeps supplementary group memberships, this less privileged user may retain access to resources only meant for the original (potentially privileged) user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Icecast configuration file `/etc/icecast.xml`, specifically the `<changeowner>` section. An attacker would need to somehow manipulate this configuration.
- An attacker could potentially modify the `icecast.xml` configuration to use the `<changeowner>` directive and specify a less privileged user but retain supplementary group memberships they should not have.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify the Icecast configuration file, `/etc/icecast.xml`.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the supplementary groups of the user Icecast runs under.
- The attacker needs to be able to restart Icecast after modifying the configuration.
- This issue is only exploitable if the `<changeowner>` configuration is used.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Icecast version 2.4.0, where supplementary groups are now correctly set based on the UID when `<changeowner>` is used.
- The issue is considered a security issue and users were recommended to update immediately.
- The issue was found by the Security Response Team.
