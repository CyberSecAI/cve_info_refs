Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9379:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `radius_get_attribute` function. The function passes `attr_len` by reference, which is later used as the length argument in `strncpy`. A subtraction operation (`-2`) is performed on the `attr_len` value which, due to the use of `u_int16`, might result in a negative number if the original value is less than 2 (e.g. 1). This negative value, when interpreted as an unsigned integer, becomes a large positive value (e.g., 0xffff - 0xfffe, represented as 65535 or similar). This large value is then passed to strncpy, resulting in a stack buffer overflow when copying the attribute data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient length check in `radius_get_attribute` function when handling the length of attributes and passing them to strncpy.
- Type casting issues when `u_int16` undergoes subtraction leading to an integer underflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack corruption, which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected process. This would allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the system or cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted RADIUS packets that cause the length calculation in `radius_get_attribute` to result in a negative value after subtraction. This likely involves sending a RADIUS attribute with a very small length value, leading to the underflow.
- This is a remote exploitation vulnerability as RADIUS is typically used as an authentication protocol over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send RADIUS packets to a vulnerable server running `ettercap`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to craft a RADIUS packet that triggers the vulnerability by providing a length value that causes an integer underflow.
- No specific user privileges are required by the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
