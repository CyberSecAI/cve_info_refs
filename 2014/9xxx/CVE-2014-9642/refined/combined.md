# Analysis Of An Interesting Windows Kernel Change Mitigating Vulnerabilities In Some Security Products

Last year I started researching into the Windows kernel to get a better understanding of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities in the kernel are a serious issue as they could be used to bypass browsers sandboxes and end up compromising the entire system. In general most people assume that security products are developed with security in mind and can be trusted, so I thought I would start my assessment on security products and see how secure they really are from kernel attacks.  Within a couple of months of research six vulnerabilities had already been discovered in various products from different vendors. What was particularly interesting is that they all exhibited the same type of vulnerability, which only seemed to exist on older operating systems.

This blog post details the technical research carried out in order to pinpoint the root cause as to what had changed from Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to later Windows operating systems.

**The vulnerability**

The vulnerability exists when drivers do not validate the output buffer address and output buffer size. Applications wanting to talk to the kernel communicate through the use of the **DeviceIOControl** function.

```
DeviceIoControl(hDevice, 0x00222000, inbuffer, BUFSIZE, (LPVOID)0xF4F5F6F7, 0, &dwRetBytes, NULL);
```

In this example we can see two things of interest, first is that using LPVOID we can send in a hardcoded output buffer address and second is the output buffer length has been defined to 0. Sending this to a vulnerable driver will trigger a bugcheck.

**Debugger Output**

In the bugcheck analysis below the write address is the same as passed through the DeviceIOControl function, which basically means we have found an arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability. If we look at the call stack, the bugcheck was triggered in function nt!IopCompleteRequest

```

**Vulnerable Driver Analysis**

Reverse engineering the driver the bugcheck is triggered after the call of the function **IofCompleteRequest**.

![](/images/iocompleterequestdemo.png)

The **IoCompleteRequest** function indicates that the driver has completed all processing for a given IRP and is returning the IRP back to the I/O manager. IRP is an I/O request packet and is how Windows communicates with drivers. The IRP data structure contains information used by drivers.

**Comparing IRP data**

Since the goal was to find the root cause as to why this vulnerability only applies to older versions of Windows, I started comparing Windows XP to Windows 7. Setting a breakpoint before our call to the IoCompleteRequest function and looking at the IRP data in WinDbg, we can see UserBuffer contains the address of our output buffer address. One noticeable change was the “Flags” value. Windows XP had a value of 0x70 whereas Windows 7 had a value of 0x60030

In Windows XP ebx contains pointer to IRP

**IoCompleteRequest Analysis**

The exported function IoCompleteRequest in **ntoskrnl.exe** ends up calling IopCompleteRequest function. We can see on Windows XP that it does a bitwise 40 AND 70 and jumps to the inlined memcpy code which ends up triggering the bugcheck.

![](/images/iopcompleterequestxp.png)

On Windows 7 we see the bitwise 40 AND 30 takes a different codepath and never hits our memcpy.

![](/images/iopcompleterequestw7.png)

The “test al, 40h” instruction on Windows 7 branches off to another codepath as its doing a bitwise 40 AND 30 instead of bitwise 40 AND 70 as al=30h on Windows 7 which is from the IRP flags value.

**IopXxxControlFile Analysis**

“So what causes the flags value to be 30h instead of 70h?” was my next question. After some investigation I discovered that **IopXxxControlFile** held the answer. The IopXxxControlFile function had been called earlier in our call stack. This function does a number of checks and validations on the inputs provided such as if addresses are in user space, buffer lengths, etc. and sets up our data in IRP.

In this function near the beginning it calls the **ProbeForWrite** function which checks if the address falls in the user space range and writable. The first thing the function does though is check the output buffer length, if zero it returns back to the IopXxxControlFile function without even checking the output buffer address. The ProbeForWrite function below is from Windows XP but is also the same for Windows 7.

[![](/images/probeforwritexp.png)](/images/probeforwritexp.png)

Returning back to the IopXxxControlFile function and after a number of checks near the end of the code we see our output buffer address being placed in the IRP UserBuffer field and Flags value being updated to 0x70, all it checks on Windows XP if an output buffer address is available.

![](/images/iopxxxcontrolfilexp.png)

On Windows 7 we finally discover the root cause as to what has changed in the IopXxxControlFile function. It checks the output buffer length instead of the output buffer address. Since the output buffer length is 0 the flags value does not get set to 0x70 thus mitigating the vulnerability.

![](/images/iopxxxcontrolfilew7.png)

**What do these flags values mean?**

So what do these values 10h, 30h, 40h and 70h represent? Searching through wdm.h header file I found these definitions:

```
#define IRP_BUFFERED_IO                 0x00000010
#define IRP_DEALLOCATE_BUFFER           0x00000020
#define IRP_INPUT_OPERATION             0x00000040
```

The values are set in IopXxxControlFile function by performing an OR operation. So doing an OR on IRP\_BUFFERED\_IO | IRP\_DEALLOCATE\_BUFFER produces a value of 30h

Converting into code it will look something like this

```
// Windows XP
Irp->Flags = IRP_BUFFERED_IO | IRP_DEALLOCATE_BUFFER;
Irp->UserBuffer = pBufferOut;
if (pBufferOut)
  Irp->Flags = IRP_BUFFERED_IO | IRP_DEALLOCATE_BUFFER | IRP_INPUT_OPERATION;
```
```
// Windows 7
Irp->Flags = IRP_BUFFERED_IO | IRP_DEALLOCATE_BUFFER;
Irp->UserBuffer = pBufferOut;
if (iBufferOutSize)
  Irp->Flags = IRP_BUFFERED_IO | IRP_DEALLOCATE_BUFFER | IRP_INPUT_OPERATION;
```

When it comes to carry its memcpy operation in IoCompleteRequest function it will look something like this

```
if (Irp->Flags & IRP_BUFFERED_IO)
{
  if ((Irp->Flags & IRP_INPUT_OPERATION)
     &&  (Irp->IoStatus.Status != STATUS_VERIFY_REQUIRED)
     && !(NT_ERROR(Irp->IoStatus.Status)))
  {
       RtlCopyMemory(Irp->UserBuffer, Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer, Irp->IoStatus.Information);
  }
}
```

Here is it does its bitwise AND operation and dictates its outcome, jump or not to jump.

**Conditions of a Vulnerable Driver**

During completion of an IRP the I/O Manager copies the data from the system buffer back to the user’s output buffer if using Buffered I/O method (METHOD\_BUFFERED) and the status is of a success or warning. The number of bytes to copy is taken from the Irp->IoStatus.Information field.

The following range values indicate error and warning status codes:

*NTSTATUS codes 0xC0000000 – 0xFFFFFFFF are errors*

*NTSTATUS codes 0x80000000 – 0xBFFFFFFF are warnings*

In the above code we can see it uses the macro NT\_ERROR() to evaluate if not an error status.

So if the data is too large for the buffer, the driver completes the IRP with a status STATUS\_BUFFER\_OVERFLOW (0x80000005), which falls in the warning range, and the Irp->IoStatus.Information will be updated with the buffer size and data copied over. If completed with status STATUS\_BUFFER\_TOO\_SMALL (0xC0000023) which falls in the error range, the I/O Manager does not copy any data back to the output buffer as it sets the Irp->IoStatus.Information to 0.

To reproduce a vulnerable driver for testing purposes use this code in your dispatch routine for Buffered I/O. The IoStatus.Information value has to be 1 or more for an overwrite to take place.

```
Irp->IoStatus.Information = 4;
Irp->IoStatus.Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;
IoCompleteRequest(Irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT);
```

Windows supports three I/O transfer methods, which the driver developer can use for reading and writing data to memory. One method being Buffered I/O where the I/O Manager allocates a system buffer of equal size to the users inputted buffer. For write operations, the I/O manager copies the user’s buffer data into the system buffer. For read operations, the I/O manager copies data from the system buffer to the users output buffer when the IRP completes and then frees the system buffer. Buffered I/O is defined in the driver for example like this

```
CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x800, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
```

So when using METHOD\_BUFFERED it copies our system data back to our UserBuffer address when IRP is completed using the IoCompleteRequest function.

**Fixing a Vulnerable Driver**

Asking the same question to all the vendors on how they each fixed the issue it was interesting to find different approaches had been taken. One approach was

to check if the output buffer address was in the user space

```
if (Irp->UserBuffer > MmHighestUserAddress)
{
    ntStatus = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
}
```

Another approach was to check the size of the output buffer

```
if (iBufferOutSize < sizeof(ULONG))
{
    ntStatus = STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```

Depending on the dispatch conditions just by changing the status value to an error status is enough to resolve the vulnerability.

I would like to thank BullGuard, AVG and K7 Computing for kindly sharing information. A special thanks to [BullGuard](http://www.bullguard.com) as they were very helpful and provided a lot more important information which saved me a lot of time on this research. I can’t say the same for the other three vendors: McAfee, Symantec and TrendMicro. All three decided not to share anything; do you see anything confidential in the above code?

**Published Advisories**

This table below provides information on the products where this vulnerability had been discovered.

Advisories published by some vendors were very unprofessional. Trend Micro had to be advised to correct their description, as they didn’t get it right the first time since it had a number of mistakes and was initially published without consultation. Also the fix applies all the way to Trend Titanium products 2015, which was stated in my vulnerability report but not mentioned in their advisory.

For Symantec, well they are not any better. After waiting nearly two months they ended up releasing an advisory advising only to uninstall the driver. Also, their advisory link in their mitigation information section refers to a knowledge base article [DOC7993](http://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&id=DOC7993) on how to remove the driver. However, if you take a look as this article it starts off mentioning the MQAC.sys driver and points to a Microsoft link. I had this flagged at the time but no action has been taken. It’s a similar vulnerability so they must have just copied and pasted it without reading it.

What is really shocking is that McAfee took 99 days to release an advisory to the public whereas BullGuard took only 16 days. Does that mean if an exploit was made public we would have had to wait 99 days for an update? Also, McAfee failed to mention in their advisory that it also affects Windows Server 2003, which was clearly stated in my vulnerability report as the product is supported on Windows Server 2003. I however did not test it on Windows Server 2003 R2 (32bit) but did reverse engineer ntoskrnl.exe from Windows Server 2003 R2 (64bit) and did have only the address check in the IopXxxControlFile function. There is a 64bit version for McAfee DLP so should be exploitable too.

**Other Vendors**

Assessment carried out on some of the security vendors’ products that were not affected from this type of vulnerability are listed below. This is no way an assurance that their products are free from this vulnerability, as there is a possibility some ioctls may have been missed, input buffer sizes may have changed the codepath, device handles not loaded, etc.

* Agnitum
* AhnLab
* Avast
* Avira
* BitDefender
* ClamAV
* Comodo
* Emsisoft
* Eset
* Fortinet
* FRISK Software
* F-Secure
* G Data
* Kaspersky Lab
* Kingsoft
* Malwarebytes
* Nano Security
* Norman
* Panda Security
* Sophos
* TrustPort
* ThreatTrack Security
* Webroot
* Zemana

**Other Windows Versions**

Since all my tests were on a fully patched Windows XP SP3 32bit and Windows 7 SP1 32bit I thought I’d check some other operating systems. Checking on Windows Server 2003 SP2 Standard Edition 32bit found to have the same issue as Windows XP and during tests exploited successfully. Windows Server 2003 has still got over 5 months before the end-of-life so for those of you still using Windows 2003 better upgrade to a later operating system if you’ve not already done so.

On a clean default installation of Windows Vista 32bit in an unpatched state the output buffer length check had been applied like Windows 7. This means Microsoft did know about this issue and added the check before release.

There are plenty of products designed only to run on Windows Servers, which I have not audited, so maybe it’s a good time for researchers to discover some low-hanging fruit.

**Final thoughts**

One thing is clear from this research and working with vendors: Just because it’s a big company doesn’t mean you’ll get great service. There are plenty of other vendors doing an excellent job so we should not blindly need to go with the likes of McAfee, Symantec or Trend Micro.

Updating machines is a tedious job at times so really we should be focusing on mitigation products like Microsoft EMET and MalwareBytes Anti-Exploit and not be so dependent on constantly updating machines for security. Bottom line is to upgrade to the latest operating systems as it will have a number of mitigations, checks, validations in place that we probably don’t even know about yet keeping us safe.

*I’ll start submitting the exploits to Exploit-DB in the next few days and tweet you all once published.*

   Hello there, I have a doubt regarding what you have described here.. you say the problem is when using buffered IO Method.. but here your example is using IRP->UserBuffer, which is only used if the method is NEITHER… and thats why you must not only the addresses but also the length of the data…

   When using buffered method, the IOManager do these checks for you on behalf… You will get an error if you call deviceIoControl for a buffered method IOCTL with an output buffer with that address.

   This is what most think that IRP->UserBuffer is only used by NEITHER I/O method which is not true. BUFFERED method does do some checks as I’ve explained as you can see the lack of size validation in older OS’s bypasses the address validation. So using BUFFERED method you can write to the output userbuffer.

Our mission is not only to help keep you Cyber Safe, but also to make sure your journey and experience with us is easy and straightforward.

##### Frequently Asked Questions

I cannot find my BullGuard app on my device anymore. Where did it go?

The icon has changed from the BullGuard logo to the Norton logo.

Please look out for this icon on your device: ![](images/norton-your-device.png)

Do my devices still have protection from BullGuard?

We migrated your BullGuard subscription to Norton. With this transition, your protection will continue uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).

I heard BullGuard products/services are discontinued. As a current BullGuard customer, what do I need to do?

We migrated your BullGuard subscription to Norton. The migration to Norton is automatic, and your protection continues uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).

**Note:** If you have backed up data using BullGuard, we recommend that you [restore your BullGuard backup data](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20221026195749447&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20221026195749447) first and then proceed with the migration steps.

I still see BullGuard app on my device. How do I migrate to Norton?

While migration to Norton is set to be automatic, it may not happen automatically in some cases. If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you manually migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).

How can I compare the different Norton GO plans?

Your current BullGuard subscription is migrated to an equivalent Norton subscription, at the same price as your BullGuard subscription. If you want to compare the different plans, you can find the comparison table [here](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220928185957303&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220928185957303).

With this change, will my BullGuard Customer Account continue to be accessible?

Your BullGuard account is already migrated to Norton. You will be able to [sign in to the Norton account](https://my.norton.com/?inid=hho_bg_eol_faq_to_ngp) with your existing BullGuard credentials.

**Note:** If you used a username for your BullGuard account, be sure to add **'@bullguard.com'** to the username while entering the email address field to access your Norton account.

Will my current BullGuard subscription still be able to renew, or will I be able to change it to another BullGuard subscription?

BullGuard products and services are no longer supported. Your current BullGuard subscription is migrated to an equivalent Norton subscription, at the same price as your BullGuard subscription. Rest assured; your protection will continue uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period. Your subscriptionâs length will also not change â all remaining days left on your current BullGuard subscription are kept and transitioned to your Norton subscription.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).

Will my BullGuard subscription still renew automatically?

Yes. If you have a BullGuard automatically renewing subscription, it is migrated to an equivalent Norton automatically renewing subscription, at the same price as your BullGuard subscription. Rest assured; your protection will continue uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period.

Your subscriptionâs length will also not change â all remaining days left on your current BullGuard subscription are kept and transitioned to your Norton subscription.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).
Your Norton subscription will renew automatically as long as your billing details are up to date in [my.norton.com](https://my.norton.com/).

If my product or service changes to Norton, will my data still be protected and processed the same way?

When it comes to your personal data, we are committed to providing you with transparency. We process personal data in accordance with applicable legislation.

We do not sell, share, lease, or rent your personal data to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

Do Norton products and services have the same security protection as BullGuard?

Yes. Norton technology blocks millions of cyberthreats every day and provides real-time protection against existing and emerging threats that could put your personal information at risk. Norton has four decades of consumer cybersecurity experience.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
