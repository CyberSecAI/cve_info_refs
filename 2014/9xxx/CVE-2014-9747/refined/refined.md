Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `t42_parse_encoding` function within `t42parse.c`. Specifically, when parsing an encoding array with only immediates, the code does not properly handle this case and will get into an infinite loop if there is no handling provided. The comment added to the code states: "Since the current position is not updated for immediates-only mode we would get an infinite loop if we don't do anything here."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Internal State Distinction (CWE-372):** The code fails to properly distinguish and handle the "immediates-only" mode of encoding arrays in Type 42 fonts. This results in an infinite loop if this mode is encountered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious Type 42 font file that triggers the infinite loop in `t42_parse_encoding`. This will lead to excessive CPU usage and a denial of service for applications using the FreeType library to render fonts. The application becomes unresponsive and unusable, crashing eventually.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Font File:** The primary attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted Type 42 font file containing an encoding array with only immediates to an application using FreeType.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply a malicious font file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Type 42 font file to a vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Embedding the malicious font in a document or web page
    - Providing the malicious font to the application through a file selection dialog.

In summary, CVE-2014-9747 is a vulnerability in FreeType's Type 42 font parsing that results from the library's failure to handle "immediates-only" encoding arrays properly, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious Type 42 font with a specific encoding array format.
