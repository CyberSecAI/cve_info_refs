# Lantronix xPrintServer Code execution and CSRF vulnerability

Hi,

The Lantronix xPrintServer is a small Linux powered print server for iOS. Main configuration happens through a web
interface.

The problem is that the configuration happens through some ‘RPC’ interface; the web interfaces uses AJAX requests to
talk to a CGI script that simply executes shell commands given to it. Take a look at the following screenshot:

So.. that’s not really so secure. Launching a request to <http://myip/ips?OP=rpc&c=whoami&a=0> tells me that everything
is running as root.

To make matters worse:
- The CGI script is accessible without needing to use credentials
- The devices uses bonjour that by defaults registers itself as xprintserver.local in the local network
- The device has no CSRF protection

Example code that allows any website to fetch the Linux version.
<script
src="<http://xprintserver.local/ips?OP=rpc&c=echo%20var%20version=%27%22%27%20$>(uname%20-a)%27%22%27&a=0”></script>

This vulnerability is not reported to the vendor yet (because I need to register talk to their support).

Greetings,
Jim
