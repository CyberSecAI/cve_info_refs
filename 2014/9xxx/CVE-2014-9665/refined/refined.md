  "CVE-2014-9665": {
    "Description": "The Load_SBit_Png function in sfnt/pngshim.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 does not restrict the rows and pitch values of PNG data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by embedding a PNG file in a .ttf font file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of rows and pitch values in PNG data during bitmap loading.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted TTF font file embedding a malicious PNG.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of providing the crafted font file."
