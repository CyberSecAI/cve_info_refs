Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application discloses database credentials due to informative error messages. Specifically, when a database connection fails, a stack trace is outputted that includes the database username and password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive database credentials (username and password) in error messages.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The application does not properly handle database connection errors, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Compromise of Database:** An attacker who obtains the database credentials can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete control over the data.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the database user, this could also lead to further compromise of the system running the database.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Triggering Database Connection Failure:** An attacker can trigger a database connection failure to reveal the credentials. In the provided example, this was achieved by causing a connection error during a password reset request by shutting down the database. The specific request sent is a POST request to the `/vvv/cmfive/auth/forgotpassword` endpoint with the user login and a token, but other methods to trigger a database connection error are not excluded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to trigger a database connection failure:** The attacker must be able to send a request that will cause the database connection to fail.
- **Basic understanding of web requests:** Knowledge of HTTP requests is required to send the payload.
