  "info": "The provided content describes a CAPTCHA bypass vulnerability in MantisBT, which is directly related to CVE-2014-9117.\n\nRoot cause: The CAPTCHA system used a predictable method for generating keys. The 'public_key' was passed as a GET parameter and used to generate a captcha value. This allowed an attacker to reuse the same key and captcha value to bypass the registration process.\n\nWeakness: The weakness is in how the CAPTCHA verification was implemented. The key was derived from a combination of a secret and a public key, where the public key was sent as a parameter. This made it possible for an attacker to predict the CAPTCHA and bypass the verification.\n\nImpact: By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious individual could perform a denial-of-service attack by indiscriminately creating new accounts, thus generating a high load on the server.\n\nAttack vector: The attack vector is the registration form of the application. The attacker would send a request to the registration page and capture the 'public_key' which is used to generate the captcha image, then reuse this value to bypass the captcha in subsequent requests.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MantisBT server, and to be able to capture the public key associated with the captcha image and then reuse it. No special privileges are needed.\n\nMore Detail: The fix for this vulnerability included changing the method of generating and using captcha keys to store the key in a session rather than passing it through form fields. Also, the entropy of the random number used to generate the key was increased by removing the upper limit of mt_rand(), using mt_getrandmax() instead.",
