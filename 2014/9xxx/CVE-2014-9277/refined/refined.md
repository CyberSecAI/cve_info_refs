Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki handles `<cross-domain-policy>` tags when generating API responses in PHP serialized format. The function `wfMangleFlashPolicy()` attempts to sanitize these tags by replacing them with `<NOT-cross-domain-policy>`. However, the regex used to find these tags could match variable lengths of whitespace while the replacement is always the same length. This length difference can be exploited after PHP serialization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary serialized values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Sanitization:** The core issue is the flawed sanitization logic within `wfMangleFlashPolicy()`. The regex replacement does not preserve the length of the matched string, creating an opportunity for injection.
*   **PHP Unserialization Vulnerability:** By injecting specially crafted serialized strings into the output, the attacker can trigger the unserialization of attacker-controlled data, which is a known vulnerability in PHP.
*   **API Exposure:** The vulnerability is exposed through the MediaWiki API when the `format=php` parameter is used, which returns PHP serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious serialized objects, an attacker could trigger the execution of arbitrary PHP code when the API response is unserialized. This could lead to a full compromise of the server running MediaWiki.
*   **File Overwriting:** An attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files on the server through the exploitation of the unserialization vulnerability.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may be able to manipulate application data or potentially gain unauthorized access through the crafted objects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Article Editing:** The attacker injects the malicious payload by editing an article on the wiki. The malicious payload includes a `<cross-domain-policy>` tag with carefully crafted whitespace, followed by serialized PHP code
*   **API Request:** The attacker then triggers the vulnerability by making a request to the MediaWiki API with the `format=php` parameter, requesting content of the edited page.
*   **Unserialization:** The API response containing the injected malicious serialized data will be unserialized on the client side, which leads to arbitrary code execution or file overwriting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Edit Articles:** The attacker must be able to edit wiki pages on the target MediaWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of PHP Serialization:** The attacker needs knowledge of PHP serialization techniques to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Access to the API:** The attacker must be able to make requests to the MediaWiki API.
*   **API Client that unserializes PHP:** The attacker needs a target which fetches data via the API and unserializes the data.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects API clients that use `format=php` and unserialize the response.
*   The `wfMangleFlashPolicy` function was originally designed to prevent flash-based attacks by stripping `<cross-domain-policy>` tags, but it was implemented incorrectly.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the provided patches that fix the mangling function and allow for disabling the functionality.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.23.7, 1.22.14 and 1.19.22.
*   The issue was reported by user PleaseStand.
