Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in Docker's handling of absolute symlinks during image processing. Specifically, Docker did not properly check for path traversals in absolute symlinks, only considering relative ones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to use absolute symlinks within a container image to traverse the host file system, writing files outside of the intended container environment.
- **Inadequate Symlink Handling:** Docker's symlink processing was flawed, allowing for absolute symlinks to bypass path traversal checks that were in place for relative symlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A malicious container image could overwrite arbitrary parts of the host filesystem.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting critical host files, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges on the host system.
- **Container Escape:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the container's isolation, impacting the host system directly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Container Images:** The primary attack vector is through crafted container images that include malicious absolute symlinks.
- **Archive Extraction:** The vulnerability could be exploited during the extraction of container image archives.
- **Volume Mounts:** It could also be exploited when using volume mounts with crafted symlinks.
- **Malicious Dockerfiles:**  Building images from malicious Dockerfiles that include absolute symlinks is another way to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious container images:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious container image.
- **Ability to deploy a container from the malicious image:** The attacker needs to be able to run a container created from the malicious image on a vulnerable Docker host.
- **No special privileges needed on the host:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the host system to carry out this exploit, as the vulnerability lies in how Docker processes the images.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Docker Inc.
- Red Hat acknowledged the issue and indicated that they do not recommend running untrusted container images.
- Fixes were released in later versions of docker (docker 1.3.3 according to bugzilla)
- This issue affects Docker versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
