| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c0)  Trevor Jay    2014-12-10 17:03:41 UTC  ```  A problem was reported by Docker Inc. whereby a malicious image could overwrite arbitrary portions of the host filesystem by including absolute symlinks. From the upstream report:  "Path traversal attacks are possible in the processing of absolute symlinks. In checking symlinks for traversals, only relative links were considered. This allowed path traversals to exist where they should have otherwise been prevented. This was exploitable via both archive extraction and through volume mounts.  This vulnerability allowed malicious images or builds from malicious Dockerfiles to write files to the host system and escape containerization, leading to privilege escalation."   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c1)  Trevor Jay    2014-12-10 17:24:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of Docker as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario. A future update may address this issue.  Red Hat does not support or recommend running untrusted images.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-11 20:50:37 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/docker-user/nFAz-B-n4Bw>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-11 21:01:59 UTC  ```  Created docker-io tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1173324](show_bug.cgi?id=1173324 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9357 CVE-2014-9356 CVE-2014-9358 docker-io: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1173325](show_bug.cgi?id=1173325 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9357 CVE-2014-9356 CVE-2014-9358 docker-io: various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c4)  Trevor Jay    2014-12-12 01:59:14 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Docker Inc. for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1172761#c5)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-15 04:32:41 UTC  ``` docker-io-1.4.0-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.
