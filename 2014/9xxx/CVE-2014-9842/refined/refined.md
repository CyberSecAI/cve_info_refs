  "CVE-2014-9842": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2014-9842",
      "CveDescription": "Memory leak in the ReadPSDLayers function in coders/psd.c in ImageMagick 6.8.9.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via unspecified vectors."
    },
    "Technical Description": {
      "RootCause": "The vulnerability is a memory leak within the ReadPSDLayers function.",
      "Vulnerability": "The ReadPSDLayers function in coders/psd.c of ImageMagick 6.8.9.9 fails to properly release allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.",
       "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory on the targeted system.",
      "AttackVectors": "The attack vector is remote and the vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes a crafted PSD file.",
      "AttackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PSD file to an application that uses ImageMagick"
    }
