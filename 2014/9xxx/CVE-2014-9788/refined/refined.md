{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm kernel driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device. This could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a local malicious application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the target device."
