Vulnerability title: Remote SSL VPN Endpoint Identity Not Verified In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-9755
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version: 2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:
        The hardware VPN client on the affected device connects to the remote VPN endpoint and initiates an SSL connection using TLSv1.1. The client then initiates a protocol exchange. The hardware VPN client does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange. This lack of validation allows for a protocol downgrade attack.
        In this example, a downgrade attack from protocol version 3 to protocol version 2 is performed. Version 3 of the protocol is also similarly affected.

Root cause of vulnerability: The hardware VPN client does not validate the remote VPN endpoint's SSL certificate.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Missing SSL certificate validation, allowing for protocol downgrade attacks.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially man-in-the-middle the VPN connection and potentially gain access to the communication.
Attack vectors: By intercepting the initial handshake of the VPN connection.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position between the client and the legitimate VPN endpoint.
