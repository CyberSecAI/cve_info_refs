Vulnerability title: Multiple Instances Of Cross-site Scripting In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-2045
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

        The data supplied to both the `old' and `new' web applications (the device has two web based management
interfaces) was permanently stored and could be retrieved later by other users. This is a normal feature of many
applications, however, in this instance the application failed to restrict the type of data that could be stored and
also failed to sanitise it, meaning that it could not be safely rendered by the browser.

        Stored cross-site scripting could be triggered by:

                Attempting to login with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>' (affects `old' interface and results
in post-authentication cross-site Scripting when a legitimate administrator views the realtime log)
                Creating an account with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>' (affects both `old' and `new'
interfaces once created)
                Setting the device's hostname to `<script>alert(1)</script>'  (affects `old' interface once created)

        A number of locations were identified as being vulnerable to reflective attacks, including:

http://<host>/exec?module=config&sessionid=<sessionid>&inspect=%3Cscript%20src=<http://localhost:9090%3E%3C/script%3E>
http://<host>/exec?tool=atcommands&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&commands=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
http://<host>/exec?tool=ping&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&host=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&pingcount=3&databytes=56

        The inclusion of session IDs in all URLs partially mitigates the reflective cross-site scripting but could
itself be considered a vulnerability since it is included in referred headers and log files.

        These are simply some examples of how this attack might be performed, and the it is believed that both the
`old' and `new' web applications are systemically vulnerable to this.

Vulnerability title: Remote SSL VPN Endpoint Identity Not Verified In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-9754, CVE-2014-9755
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

        In order for the hardware VPN client on the affected device to establish a VPN channel it connects to the
remote VPN endpoint and initiates an SSL connection using TLSv1.1. It then initiates the following exchange (protocol
version 2):

client> VERSION 3
server> ERROR
client> VERSION 2
server> +OK Protocol version 2 chosen
client> TUNNEL test
server> +OK Tunnel chosen
client> PASS test
server> +OK You are now authenticated
client> CHANNEL test
server> +OK Channel selected
client> DATA

        The hardware VPN client does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the
endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange.

        In this example, we perform a downgrade attack from protocol version 3 to protocol version 2, however as noted
in the impact, version 3 of the protocol is similarly affected.

        Note: MITRE have assigned CVE-2014-9754 to reference the missing certificate validation and CVE-2014-9755 to
reference the protocol downgrade attack.
