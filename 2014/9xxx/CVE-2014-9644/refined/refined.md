Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's crypto subsystem regarding how it screens module names for automatic module loading. Specifically, when a user attempts to load a crypto module via the AF_ALG socket type, the kernel performs a lookup based on the provided module name. The flaw lies in the insufficient sanitization of the module name, allowing a local attacker to bypass intended restrictions by including a valid crypto module name as part of a larger string, e.g., `vfat(aes)`. The kernel would then attempt to load modules based on the complete string (including `vfat`), increasing the attack surface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient input validation**: The crypto subsystem does not properly validate or sanitize the provided module names before attempting to load them.
- **Bypass of intended module loading restrictions:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing intended module loading restrictions via using a valid crypto module name as part of a larger string.
- **Automatic module loading abuse**: The kernel's mechanism for automatic loading of crypto modules is exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to load arbitrary kernel modules. This expands the attack surface of the running kernel and could be used to gain administrative privileges.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** Loading arbitrary kernel modules introduces code that was not explicitly intended to be loaded and executed, increasing the kernel's attack surface.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **AF_ALG Socket:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user tries to load a crypto module using the AF_ALG socket type.
- **Malicious Module Names:** The attacker crafts module names to bypass restrictions and load arbitrary modules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
- **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not need to be a privileged user.
- **Knowledge of Crypto Subsystem:** The attacker needs knowledge of the crypto subsystem and the module loading mechanism.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a variation of a previous issue (CVE-2013-7421) which was fixed by prefixing all module requests with `crypto-`. However, it was found that the template module loading was not handling the prefix correctly.
- The fix involves adding the `crypto-` prefix to the template lookup, ensuring that modules with names such as `vfat(aes)` are properly filtered.
- The fix includes adding MODULE_ALIAS\_CRYPTO for relevant crypto modules to be loaded correctly.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions before 3.19 and specifically targets systems with CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API enabled.
- The vulnerability can be triggered on systems where userspace applications can load kernel modules by abusing the `request_module()` kernel call.
