## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Eric Windisch discovered flaw in how the Linux kernel's XFS file system

replaces remote attributes. A local access with access to an XFS file

system could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges.

([CVE-2015-0274](/security/CVE-2015-0274))

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

The Linux kernel's splice system call did not correctly validate its

parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-7822](/security/CVE-2014-7822))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) failed to

verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous

UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9728](/security/CVE-2014-9728))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a

malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors.

([CVE-2014-9729](/security/CVE-2014-9729))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who

is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other

undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9730](/security/CVE-2014-9730))

Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system

(CONFIG\_UDF\_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file

system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel

memory. ([CVE-2014-9731](/security/CVE-2014-9731))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

                 CVE-2015-1420 CVE-2015-1421 CVE-2015-1593

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation.

CVE-2013-7421 / CVE-2014-9644

    It was discovered that the Crypto API allowed unprivileged users
    to load arbitrary kernel modules. A local user can use this flaw
    to exploit vulnerabilities in modules that would not normally be
    loaded.

CVE-2014-7822

    Akira Fujita found that the splice() system call did not validate
    the given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
    this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
    possibly other effects.

CVE-2014-8160

    Florian Westphal discovered that a netfilter (iptables/ip6tables) rule
    accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
    port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
    If only the generic connection tracking module (nf_conntrack) was
    loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
    this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
    protocol.

CVE-2014-8559

    It was found that kernel functions that iterate over a directory
    tree can dead-lock or live-lock in case some of the directory
    entries were recently deleted or dropped from the cache. A local
    unprivileged user can use this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2014-9585

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO
    in 64-bit processes is extremely biased. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
    mechanism.

CVE-2014-9683

    Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
    the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
    in local denial of service.

CVE-2015-0239

    It was found that KVM did not correctly emulate the x86 SYSENTER
    instruction. An unprivileged user within a guest system that has
    not enabled SYSENTER, for example because the emulated CPU vendor
    is AMD, could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation in that guest.

CVE-2015-1420

    It was discovered that the open_by_handle_at() system call reads
    the handle size from user memory a second time after validating
    it. A local user with the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability could use
    this flaw for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1421

    It was found that the SCTP implementation could free an
    authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
    corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-1593

    It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
    64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
    A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
    bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u2. Additionally this update fixes regressions
introduced in versions 3.2.65-1 and 3.2.65-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon (a subset is fixed already).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
(a subset is fixed already).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

crypto: include crypto- module prefix in templateThis adds the module loading prefix "crypto-" to the template lookup
as well.
For example, attempting to load 'vfat(blowfish)' via AF\_ALG now correctly
includes the "crypto-" prefix at every level, correctly rejecting "vfat":
net-pf-38
algif-hash
crypto-vfat(blowfish)
crypto-vfat(blowfish)-all
crypto-vfat

Subject: Re: CVE Request: Linux kernel crypto api unprivileged arbitrary module load

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> The Crypto API in the Linux kernel before 3.19 allowed unprivileged users to
> load arbitrary kernel modules.

> [https://plus.google.com/+MathiasKrause/posts/PqFCo4bfrWu](https://plus.google.com/%2BMathiasKrause/posts/PqFCo4bfrWu)

> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/4/70>
> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/5d26a105b5a73e5635eae0629b42fa0a90e07b7b>

Use CVE-2013-7421 for the original 2013 discovery by Mathias Krause,
with a "Try the code snippet below on a system with
CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API=y" attack.

The scope of CVE-2013-7421 does not include any other parts of the
related 2013-03-03 discussion. In particular, the scope of
CVE-2013-7421 does not include the general concepts of "making things
safer with no real cost" and "Allowing simple, safe, well understood
work-arounds" in the <https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/3/35> post. Also, the
scope of CVE-2013-7421 does not include any other security
implications, for other subsystems, of the "This isn't the case for
filesystems and a few others, unfortunately" observation in the
<https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/3/3/88> post.

> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/4943ba16bbc2db05115707b3ff7b4874e9e3c560>

Use CVE-2014-9644 for this second discovery in 2014, mentioned in
PqFCo4bfrWu as 'stumbled over the first flaw -- not handling crypto
templates correctly. This means, the patch would prevent loading the
vfat.ko module when requesting a cipher named "vfat" but would fail to
do so if one would request "vfat(aes)" instead.' As far as we can
tell, this is a discovery of a separate attack vector that wasn't
implied by the 2013 post.

> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e14dcf7cb80b34a1f38b55bc96f02d23fdaaaaf>

This isn't within the scope of either CVE-2013-7421 or CVE-2014-9644.
As far as we can tell, it is largely a usability fix. The example
mentioned is "This fixes, e.g., requesting 'ecb(blowfish-generic)',
which used to work with kernels v3.18 and below." Is there also a
security impact if 3e14dcf7cb80b34a1f38b55bc96f02d23fdaaaaf is
missing? For example, is it likely that code exists that requests
ecb(blowfish-generic) in an environment without
3e14dcf7cb80b34a1f38b55bc96f02d23fdaaaaf, and is able to continue
working afterward, but falls back to weak encryption?

Finally, here is one more CVE ID for the last issue that PqFCo4bfrWu
mentions:

> <https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=7652>
> <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=4e314faa0aecb66717418e9a47a4451aec59262b>

Use CVE-2014-9645. The scope of this CVE ID is the entire problem of
path stripping. (In other words, CVE-2014-9645 is not specific to the
'If one would request a cipher named "/vfat"' attack, and is not
specific to the Crypto API.)

[## Updates](/.)

This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers.

## [New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html "New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents ")

Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Note:**This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please [see this post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).
### ---

### What's Changing

Last year, we **[announced plans to wind down Currents](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/currents-spaces-migration.html)**, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published [detailed guidance](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13137538) for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for [automated migration of Currents data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12129320?p=currentsfaq&visit_id=637801097348316846-2249159324&rd=2) to spaces in Google Chat.

We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can [export Currents data using Takeout](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458) before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.

Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/), so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s16000/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s2074/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20%282%29.png)
This month, we’re enabling **new ways for organizations to share information** across the enterprise with [announcements in Google Chat](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcements-in-google-chat.html). This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.

We’ve already rolled out **new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging** such as [in-line threading](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/in-line-threading-in-Chat-spaces.html) to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and [custom emojis](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/custom-emojis-google-chat.html) to enable fun, personal expression.

We’ve also made it easier for individuals to **discover and join communities of shared interest**. By [searching in Gmail](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/chat-spaces-search-in-gmail.html), users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to [invite others to join](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/share-spaces-in-google-chat.html) via link. Last year, we increased [the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/building-larger-spaces-in-google-chat%20.html), and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.

As communities grow, it’s essential to provide **tools for content moderation and data management**. Last year, we introduced [space managers](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/define-and-manage-chat-spaces-space.html), a community lead with [abilities](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) to [moderate conversation](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) and [manage membership](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/improved-membership-management-google-chat-spaces.html), and last year at NEXT, we rolled out [data loss prevention](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/data-loss-prevention-google-chat-generally-available.html) (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.

Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through **integrations with essential third-party apps** such as [Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/how-to-be-more-productive-as-developer-5-app-integrations-for-google-chat-that-can-help.html), [Zendesk and Salesforce](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/release-notes-02-24-2023.html). Many organizations have **built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools**, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year.

For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.

(e.g. binfmt-XXXX, net-pf=NNN,snd-card-NNN, FOO-iosched, etc). This isn't the case for filesystemsand a few others, unfortunately:$ git grep 'request_module("%.*s"' | grep -vi prefixcrypto/api.c:           request_module("%s", name);drivers/mtd/chips/chipreg.c:    if (!drv && !request_module("%s", name))drivers/mtd/mtdpart.c:          if (!parser && !request_module("%s", *types))drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-drv.c:         request_module("%s", op->name);drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib_wx.c:           request_module("%s", tempbuf);fs/filesystems.c:       if (!fs && (request_module("%.*s", len, name) == 0))net/core/dev_ioctl.c:           if (!request_module("%s", name))Several of these come from hardcoded values, though (e.g. crypto, chipreg).>> > Eric Biederman, do you have any objections to that?>> -serge-Kees--Kees CookChrome OS Security ``` | \ |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1190546#c0)  Wade Mealing    2015-02-09 03:53:44 UTC  ``` Linux Kernel 2.6.38 through 3.18 are affected by a flaw in the Crypto API that allows any local user to load any installed kernel module on systems where CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API=y by abusing the request_module() call.  In the introduction of Crypto User API in the linux kernel in version 2.6.38 introduced a defect which granted userspace applications to load kernel modules on the system, by abusing the request_module() kernel call.  This patch also fixes the  The kernel accomplished loading algorithms by searching for the matching kernel module name provided when a user attempts to use a socket via the AF_ALG socket type.  Initially there were no checks involved in validating the name of the module, users could provide string and the kernel would attempt to load a module by that name in the default search path for the specific version of the kernel.  This CVE fixes additional attack vector which by abusing the template module loading format.  It solves the attack vector in which target_module(cipher) would evade the existing protection mechanism introduced when fixing in [CVE-2013-7421](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7421).

# USN-2546-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

24 March 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP

(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

([CVE-2015-1421](/security/CVE-2015-1421))

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets

to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker on the same subnet can exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-1465](/security/CVE-2015-1465))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [linux-image-3.16.0-33-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [3.16.0-33.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-33.44)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

crypto: include crypto- module prefix in template

This adds the module loading prefix "crypto-" to the template lookup
as well.

For example, attempting to load 'vfat(blowfish)' via AF_ALG now correctly
includes the "crypto-" prefix at every level, correctly rejecting "vfat":

	net-pf-38
	algif-hash
	crypto-vfat(blowfish)
	crypto-vfat(blowfish)-all
	crypto-vfat

crypto: add missing crypto module aliases
commit 3e14dcf7cb80b34a1f38b55bc96f02d23fdaaaaf upstream.
Commit 5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading with "crypto-"")
changed the automatic module loading when requesting crypto algorithms
to prefix all module requests with "crypto-". This requires all crypto
modules to have a crypto specific module alias even if their file name
would otherwise match the requested crypto algorithm.
Even though commit 5d26a105b5a7 added those aliases for a vast amount of
modules, it was missing a few. Add the required MODULE\_ALIAS\_CRYPTO
annotations to those files to make them get loaded automatically, again.
This fixes, e.g., requesting 'ecb(blowfish-generic)', which used to work
with kernels v3.18 and below.
Also change MODULE\_ALIAS() lines to MODULE\_ALIAS\_CRYPTO(). The former
won't work for crypto modules any more.

ACPI / PM: Do not disable wakeup GPEs that have not been enabled
commit 175f8e2650f7ca6b33d338be3ccc1c00e89594ea upstream.
In some cases acpi\_device\_wakeup() may be called to ensure wakeup
power to be off for a given device even though that device's wakeup
GPE has not been enabled so far. It calls acpi\_disable\_gpe() on a
GPE that's not enabled and this causes ACPICA to return the AE\_LIMIT
status code from that call which then is reported as an error by the
ACPICA's debug facilities (if enabled). This may lead to a fair
amount of confusion, so introduce a new ACPI device wakeup flag
to store the wakeup GPE status and avoid disabling wakeup GPEs
that have not been enabled.

netfilter: conntrack: fix race between confirmation and flush
commit 8ca3f5e974f2b4b7f711589f4abff920db36637a upstream.
Commit 5195c14c8b27c ("netfilter: conntrack: fix race in
\_\_nf\_conntrack\_confirm against get\_next\_corpse") aimed to resolve the
race condition between the confirmation (packet path) and the flush
command (from control plane). However, it introduced a crash when
several packets race to add a new conntrack, which seems easier to
reproduce when nf\_queue is in place.
Fix this race, in \_\_nf\_conntrack\_confirm(), by removing the CT
from unconfirmed list before checking the DYING bit. In case
race occured, re-add the CT to the dying list
This patch also changes the verdict from NF\_ACCEPT to NF\_DROP when
we lose race. Basically, the confirmation happens for the first packet
that we see in a flow. If you just invoked conntrack -F once (which
should be the common case), then this is likely to be the first packet
of the flow (unless you already called flush anytime soon in the past).
This should be hard to trigger, but better drop this packet, otherwise
we leave things in inconsistent state since the destination will likely
reply to this packet, but it will find no conntrack, unless the origin
retransmits.
The change of the verdict has been discussed in:

mm: get rid of radix tree gfp mask for pagecache\_get\_page
commit 45f87de57f8fad59302fd263dd81ffa4843b5b24 upstream.
Commit 2457aec63745 ("mm: non-atomically mark page accessed during page
cache allocation where possible") has added a separate parameter for
specifying gfp mask for radix tree allocations.
Not only this is less than optimal from the API point of view because it
is error prone, it is also buggy currently because
grab\_cache\_page\_write\_begin is using GFP\_KERNEL for radix tree and if
fgp\_flags doesn't contain FGP\_NOFS (mostly controlled by fs by
AOP\_FLAG\_NOFS flag) but the mapping\_gfp\_mask has \_\_GFP\_FS cleared then
the radix tree allocation wouldn't obey the restriction and might
recurse into filesystem and cause deadlocks. This is the case for most
filesystems unfortunately because only ext4 and gfs2 are using
AOP\_FLAG\_NOFS.
Let's simply remove radix\_gfp\_mask parameter because the allocation
context is same for both page cache and for the radix tree. Just make
sure that the radix tree gets only the sane subset of the mask (e.g. do
not pass \_\_GFP\_WRITE).
Long term it is more preferable to convert remaining users of
AOP\_FLAG\_NOFS to use mapping\_gfp\_mask instead and simplify this
interface even further.

KEYS: close race between key lookup and freeing
commit a3a8784454692dd72e5d5d34dcdab17b4420e74c upstream.
When a key is being garbage collected, it's key->user would get put before
the ->destroy() callback is called, where the key is removed from it's
respective tracking structures.
This leaves a key hanging in a semi-invalid state which leaves a window open
for a different task to try an access key->user. An example is
find\_keyring\_by\_name() which would dereference key->user for a key that is
in the process of being garbage collected (where key->user was freed but
->destroy() wasn't called yet - so it's still present in the linked list).
This would cause either a panic, or corrupt memory.

x86/apic: Re-enable PCI\_MSI support for non-SMP X86\_32
commit 38a1dfda8e77d7ba74c94d06d8bc41ba98a4bc8c upstream.
Commit 0dbc6078c06bc0 ('x86, build, pci: Fix PCI\_MSI build on !SMP')
introduced the dependency that X86\_UP\_APIC is only available when
PCI\_MSI is false. This effectively prevents PCI\_MSI support on 32bit
UP systems because it disables both APIC and IO-APIC. But APIC support
is architecturally required for PCI\_MSI.
The intention of the patch was to enforce APIC support when PCI\_MSI is
enabled, but failed to do so.
Remove the !PCI\_MSI dependency from X86\_UP\_APIC and enforce
X86\_UP\_APIC when PCI\_MSI support is enabled on 32bit UP systems.

x86, tls: Interpret an all-zero struct user\_desc as "no segment"
commit 3669ef9fa7d35f573ec9c0e0341b29251c2734a7 upstream.
The Witcher 2 did something like this to allocate a TLS segment index:
struct user\_desc u\_info;
bzero(&u\_info, sizeof(u\_info));
u\_info.entry\_number = (uint32\_t)-1;
syscall(SYS\_set\_thread\_area, &u\_info);
Strictly speaking, this code was never correct. It should have set
read\_exec\_only and seg\_not\_present to 1 to indicate that it wanted
to find a free slot without putting anything there, or it should
have put something sensible in the TLS slot if it wanted to allocate
a TLS entry for real. The actual effect of this code was to
allocate a bogus segment that could be used to exploit espfix.
The set\_thread\_area hardening patches changed the behavior, causing
set\_thread\_area to return -EINVAL and crashing the game.
This changes set\_thread\_area to interpret this as a request to find
a free slot and to leave it empty, which isn't \*quite\* what the game
expects but should be close enough to keep it working. In
particular, using the code above to allocate two segments will
allocate the same segment both times.
According to FrostbittenKing on Github, this fixes The Witcher 2.
If this somehow still causes problems, we could instead allocate
a limit==0 32-bit data segment, but that seems rather ugly to me.

x86, tls, ldt: Stop checking lm in LDT\_empty
commit e30ab185c490e9a9381385529e0fd32f0a399495 upstream.
32-bit programs don't have an lm bit in their ABI, so they can't
reliably cause LDT\_empty to return true without resorting to memset.
They shouldn't need to do this.
This should fix a longstanding, if minor, issue in all 64-bit kernels
as well as a potential regression in the TLS hardening code.

SYSENTER emulation is broken in several ways:
1. It misses the case of 16-bit code segments completely (CVE-2015-0239).
2. MSR\_IA32\_SYSENTER\_CS is checked in 64-bit mode incorrectly (bits 0 and 1 can
still be set without causing #GP).
3. MSR\_IA32\_SYSENTER\_EIP and MSR\_IA32\_SYSENTER\_ESP are not masked in
legacy-mode.
4. There is some unneeded code.

x86/tsc: Change Fast TSC calibration failed from error to info

Many users see this message when booting without knowning that it is

As explained by Paul Bolle in

"Fast TSC calibration failed" should not be considered as an error
since other calibration methods are being tried afterward. At most,
those send a warning if they fail (not an error). So let's change
the message from error to warning.

fix deadlock in cifs\_ioctl\_clone()

It really needs to check that src is non-directory \*and\* use
{un,}lock\_two\_nodirectories(). As it is, it's trivial to cause
double-lock (ioctl(fd, CIFS\_IOC\_COPYCHUNK\_FILE, fd)) and if the
last argument is an fd of directory, we are asking for trouble
by violating the locking order - all directories go before all
non-directories. If the last argument is an fd of parent
directory, it has 50% odds of locking child before parent,
which will cause AB-BA deadlock if we race with unlink().

commit 38bdf45f4aa5cb6186d50a29e6cbbd9d486a1519 upstream.
On Armada XP, 375 and 38x the MBus window 13 has the remap capability,
like windows 0 to 7. However, the mvebu-mbus driver isn't currently
taking into account this special case, which means that when window 13
is actually used, the remap registers are left to 0, making the device
using this MBus window unavailable.
As a minimal fix for stable, don't use window 13. A full fix will
follow later.

commit 8f1e8ee28660018a935c7576b9af8ffe1feab54c upstream.
The current hardware I/O coherency is known to cause problems with DMA

barriers, which is not compatible with the semantics expected by the
Linux DMA coherent buffers API.
So, in order to have enough time to validate a new solution based on

commit 55601c9f2467 (arm: omap: intc: switch over

SDMA legacy driver because that driver strictly depends
on INTC's IRQs starting at NR\_IRQs. Aparently
irq\_domain\_add\_linear() won't guarantee that, since we see
a 7 IRQs difference when booting with and without the
commit cited above.
Until arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c is properly fixed, we
must maintain OMAP2/3 using irq\_domain\_add\_legacy().
A FIXME note was added so people know to delete that
code once that legacy DMA driver is fixed up.

dm cache: fix problematic dual use of a single migration count variable
commit a59db67656021fa212e9b95a583f13c34eb67cd9 upstream.
Introduce a new variable to count the number of allocated migration
structures. The existing variable cache->nr\_migrations became
overloaded. It was used to:
i) track of the number of migrations in flight for the purposes of
quiescing during suspend.
ii) to estimate the amount of background IO occuring.
Recent discard changes meant that REQ\_DISCARD bios are processed with
a migration. Discards are not background IO so nr\_migrations was not
incremented. However this could cause quiescing to complete early.
(i) is now handled with a new variable cache->nr\_allocated\_migrations.
cache->nr\_migrations has been renamed cache->nr\_io\_migrations.
cleanup\_migration() is now called free\_io\_migration(), since it
decrements that variable.
Also, remove the unused cache->next\_migration variable that got replaced
with with prealloc\_structs a while ago.

dm cache: share cache-metadata object across inactive and active DM tables
commit 9b1cc9f251affdd27f29fe46d0989ba76c33faf6 upstream.
If a DM table is reloaded with an inactive table when the device is not
suspended (normal procedure for LVM2), then there will be two dm-bufio
objects that can diverge. This can lead to a situation where the
inactive table uses bufio to read metadata at the same time the active
table writes metadata -- resulting in the inactive table having stale
metadata buffers once it is promoted to the active table slot.
Fix this by using reference counting and a global list of cache metadata
objects to ensure there is only one metadata object per metadata device.

vb2: fix vb2\_thread\_stop race conditions
commit 6cf11ee6300f38b7cfc43af9b7be2afaa5e05869 upstream.
The locking scheme inside the vb2 thread is unsafe when stopping the
thread. In particular kthread\_stop was called \*after\* internal data
structures were cleaned up instead of doing that before. In addition,
internal vb2 functions were called after threadio->stop was set to
true and vb2\_internal\_streamoff was called. This is also not allowed.
All this led to a variety of race conditions and kernel warnings and/or
oopses.
Fixed by moving the kthread\_stop call up before the cleanup takes
place, and by checking threadio->stop before calling internal vb2
queuing operations.

ipr: wait for aborted command responses
commit 6cdb08172bc89f0a39e1643c5e7eab362692fd1b upstream.
Fixes a race condition in abort handling that was injected
when multiple interrupt support was added. When only a single
interrupt is present, the adapter guarantees it will send
responses for aborted commands prior to the response for the
abort command itself. With multiple interrupts, these responses
generally come back on different interrupts, so we need to
ensure the abort thread waits until the aborted command is
complete so we don't perform a double completion. This race
condition was being hit frequently in environments which
were triggering command timeouts, which was resulting in
a double completion causing a kernel oops.

The 00:01.0 window is illegal: it starts before the host bridge window, so
we have to assume the [0xbdf00000-0xbfffffff] region is inaccessible. We
can make it legal by clipping it to [mem 0xc0000000-0xddefffff 64bit pref].
Previously we discarded the 00:01.0 window and tried to reassign that part
of the hierarchy from scratch. That is a problem because Linux doesn't
always assign things optimally. For example, in this case, BIOS put the
01:00.0 device in a prefetchable window below 4GB, but after 5b28541552ef,
Linux puts the prefetchable window above 4GB where the 32-bit 01:00.0
device can't use it.
Clipping the 00:01.0 window is less intrusive than completely reassigning
things and is sufficient to let us use most of the BIOS configuration. Of
course, it's possible that devices below 00:01.0 will no longer fit. If
that's the case, we'll have to reassign things. But that's a separate
problem.

PCI: Pass bridge device, not bus, when updating bridge windows
commit 3f2f4dc456e9f80849b99d79600a7257690ca4b1 upstream.
pci\_setup\_bridge\_io(), pci\_setup\_bridge\_mmio(), and
pci\_setup\_bridge\_mmio\_pref() program the windows of PCI-PCI bridges.
Previously they accepted a pointer to the pci\_bus of the secondary bus,
then looked up the bridge leading to that bus. Pass the bridge directly,
which will make it more convenient for future callers.
No functional change.

workqueue: fix subtle pool management issue which can stall whole worker\_pool
commit 29187a9eeaf362d8422e62e17a22a6e115277a49 upstream.
A worker\_pool's forward progress is guaranteed by the fact that the
last idle worker assumes the manager role to create more workers and
summon the rescuers if creating workers doesn't succeed in timely
manner before proceeding to execute work items.
This manager role is implemented in manage\_workers(), which indicates
whether the worker may proceed to work item execution with its return
value. This is necessary because multiple workers may contend for the
manager role, and, if there already is a manager, others should
proceed to work item execution.
Unfortunately, the function also indicates that the worker may proceed
to work item execution if need\_to\_create\_worker() is false at the head
of the function. need\_to\_create\_worker() tests the following
conditions.
pending work items && !nr\_running && !nr\_idle
The first and third conditions are protected by pool->lock and thus
won't change while holding pool->lock; however, nr\_running can change
asynchronously as other workers block and resume and while it's likely
to be zero, as someone woke this worker up in the first place, some
other workers could have become runnable inbetween making it non-zero.
If this happens, manage\_worker() could return false even with zero
nr\_idle making the worker, the last idle one, proceed to execute work
items. If then all workers of the pool end up blocking on a resource
which can only be released by a work item which is pending on that
pool, the whole pool can deadlock as there's no one to create more
workers or summon the rescuers.
This patch fixes the problem by removing the early exit condition from
maybe\_create\_worker() and making manage\_workers() return false iff
there's already another manager, which ensures that the last worker
doesn't start executing work items.
We can leave the early exit condition alone and just ignore the return
value but the only reason it was put there is because the
manage\_workers() used to perform both creations and destructions of
workers and thus the function may be invoked while the pool is trying
to reduce the number of workers. Now that manage\_workers() is called
only when more workers are needed, the only case this early exit
condition is triggered is rare race conditions rendering it pointless.
Tested with simulated workload and modified workqueue code which
trigger the pool deadlock reliably without this patch.

libata: prevent HSM state change race between ISR and PIO
commit ce7514526742c0898b837d4395f515b79dfb5a12 upstream.
It is possible for ata\_sff\_flush\_pio\_task() to set ap->hsm\_task\_state to
HSM\_ST\_IDLE in between the time \_\_ata\_sff\_port\_intr() checks for HSM\_ST\_IDLE
and before it calls ata\_sff\_hsm\_move() causing ata\_sff\_hsm\_move() to BUG().
This problem is hard to reproduce making this patch hard to verify, but this
fix will prevent the race.
I have not been able to reproduce the problem, but here is a crash dump from
a 2.6.32 kernel.
On examining the ata port's state, its hsm\_task\_state field has a value of HSM\_ST\_IDLE:
crash> struct ata\_port.hsm\_task\_state ffff881c1121c000
hsm\_task\_state = 0
Normally, this should not be possible as ata\_sff\_hsm\_move() was called from ata\_sff\_host\_intr(),
which checks hsm\_task\_state and won't call ata\_sff\_hsm\_move() if it has a HSM\_ST\_IDLE value.

mfd: rtsx\_usb: Fix runtime PM deadlock
commit b166010f6afbadb896efa37ff85eb681a8f89392 upstream.
sd\_set\_power\_mode() in derived module drivers/mmc/host/rtsx\_usb\_sdmmc.c
acquires dev\_mutex and then calls pm\_runtime\_get\_sync() to make sure the
device is awake while initializing a newly inserted card. Once it is
called during suspending state and explicitly before rtsx\_usb\_suspend()
acquires the same dev\_mutex, both routine deadlock and further hang the
driver because pm\_runtime\_get\_sync() waits the pending PM operations.
Fix this by using an empty suspend method. mmc\_core always turns the
LED off after a request is done and thus it is ok to remove the only
rtsx\_usb\_turn\_off\_led() here.

can: m\_can: tag current CAN FD controllers as non-ISO
commit 6cfda7fbebe8a4fd33ea5722fa0212f98f643c35 upstream.
During the CAN FD standardization process within the ISO it turned out that
the failure detection capability has to be improved.
The CAN in Automation organization (CiA) defined the already implemented CAN
FD controllers as 'non-ISO' and the upcoming improved CAN FD controllers as
'ISO' compliant. See at http://www.can-cia.com/index.php?id=1937
Finally there will be three types of CAN FD controllers in the future:
1. ISO compliant (fixed)
2. non-ISO compliant (fixed, like the M\_CAN IP v3.0.1 in m\_can.c)
3. ISO/non-ISO CAN FD controllers (switchable, like the PEAK USB FD)
So the current M\_CAN driver for the M\_CAN IP v3.0.1 has to expose its non-ISO
implementation by setting the CAN\_CTRLMODE\_FD\_NON\_ISO ctrlmode at startup.
As this bit cannot be switched at configuration time CAN\_CTRLMODE\_FD\_NON\_ISO
must not be set in ctrlmode\_supported of the current M\_CAN driver.

can: dev: fix crtlmode\_supported check
commit 9b1087aa5e86448fe6ad40a58964e35f3ba423d5 upstream.
When changing flags in the CAN drivers ctrlmode the provided new content has to
be checked whether the bits are allowed to be changed. The bits that are to be
changed are given as a bitfield in cm->mask. Therefore checking against
cm->flags is wrong as the content can hold any kind of values.
The iproute2 tool sets the bits in cm->mask and cm->flags depending on the
detected command line options. To be robust against bogus user space
applications additionally sanitize the provided flags with the provided mask.

# USN-2514-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

26 February 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of

the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the

SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest

OS. ([CVE-2015-0239](/security/CVE-2015-0239))

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles

pivot\_root when used with a chroot directory. A local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop). ([CVE-2014-7970](/security/CVE-2014-7970))

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are

specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the

Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be

bypassed when conntrack rules are used. ([CVE-2014-8160](/security/CVE-2014-8160))

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local

user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or

possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. ([CVE-2014-9529](/security/CVE-2014-9529))

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing

rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

([CVE-2014-9584](/security/CVE-2014-9584))

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of

the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw

makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

([CVE-2014-9585](/security/CVE-2014-9585))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1460-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1460.80](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1460.80)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

Eric Windisch discovered flaw in how the Linux kernel's XFS file system

replaces remote attributes. A local access with access to an XFS file

system could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges.

([CVE-2015-0274](/security/CVE-2015-0274))

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

The Linux kernel's splice system call did not correctly validate its

parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-7822](/security/CVE-2014-7822))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) failed to

verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous

UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9728](/security/CVE-2014-9728))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a

malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors.

([CVE-2014-9729](/security/CVE-2014-9729))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who

is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other

undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9730](/security/CVE-2014-9730))

Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system

(CONFIG\_UDF\_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file

system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel

memory. ([CVE-2014-9731](/security/CVE-2014-9731))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-48-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-48.80~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-48.80~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-48-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-48.80~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-48.80~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of

the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the

SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest

OS. ([CVE-2015-0239](/security/CVE-2015-0239))

A flaw was discovered in the automatic loading of modules in the crypto

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to load

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles

pivot\_root when used with a chroot directory. A local user could exploit

this flaw to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop). ([CVE-2014-7970](/security/CVE-2014-7970))

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are

specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the

Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be

bypassed when conntrack rules are used. ([CVE-2014-8160](/security/CVE-2014-8160))

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local

user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or

possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. ([CVE-2014-9529](/security/CVE-2014-9529))

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing

rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

([CVE-2014-9584](/security/CVE-2014-9584))

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of

the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw

makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

([CVE-2014-9585](/security/CVE-2014-9585))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-77-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-77.112](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-77.112)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

installed kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially

using this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-7421](/security/CVE-2013-7421))

A flaw was discovered in the crypto subsystem when screening module names

for automatic module loading if the name contained a valid crypto module

name, eg. vfat(aes). A local user could exploit this flaw to load installed

kernel modules, increasing the attack surface and potentially using this to

gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9644](/security/CVE-2014-9644))

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP

(Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

([CVE-2015-1421](/security/CVE-2015-1421))

Marcelo Leitner discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's routing of packets

to too many different dsts/too fast. A remote attacker can exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-1465](/security/CVE-2015-1465))

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

crypto: add missing crypto module aliasesCommit 5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading with "crypto-"")
changed the automatic module loading when requesting crypto algorithms
to prefix all module requests with "crypto-". This requires all crypto
modules to have a crypto specific module alias even if their file name
would otherwise match the requested crypto algorithm.
Even though commit 5d26a105b5a7 added those aliases for a vast amount of
modules, it was missing a few. Add the required MODULE\_ALIAS\_CRYPTO
annotations to those files to make them get loaded automatically, again.
This fixes, e.g., requesting 'ecb(blowfish-generic)', which used to work
with kernels v3.18 and below.
Also change MODULE\_ALIAS() lines to MODULE\_ALIAS\_CRYPTO(). The former
won't work for crypto modules any more.
