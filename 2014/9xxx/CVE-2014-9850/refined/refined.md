Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-9850:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect thread limit logic in ImageMagick. Specifically, the code did not properly handle a scenario where the thread limit was set to 0, which could lead to excessive resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Logic error leading to resource exhaustion.
*   Improper handling of a 0 thread limit.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource consumption. An attacker could trigger this flaw to exhaust resources on a server, potentially crashing or severely impacting the system's performance.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A remote attacker could exploit this by providing an input that causes ImageMagick to process images using an unlimited number of threads, consuming excessive resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted input file or trigger processing in ImageMagick that results in the execution of the flawed thread limit logic. This attack can be carried out remotely via network.

**Additional details:**

* The Suse security advisory mentions this issue affects ImageMagick 6.8.9.9.
*   The SUSE bugzilla entries 982969 and 984149 are referenced, indicating that the issue was fixed within SUSE products, but does not offer technical details of the fix.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry 1343510 references this CVE as “ImageMagick: incorrect thread limit logic”. This entry does not provide additional information and is marked as WONTFIX.
* The Debian commit link provides some details that the flaw is related to a logical error that results in an infinite loop if the thread limit is set to zero.
* The advisory from ubuntu mentions an attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

This is a logic error in the code related to thread management, which can be triggered by supplying an input that causes excessive threads to be created, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
