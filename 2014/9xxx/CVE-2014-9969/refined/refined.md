  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The provided document does not contain specific details about CVE-2014-9969. However, it lists CVE-2014-9968, CVE-2014-9973, CVE-2014-9974, CVE-2014-9975, CVE-2014-9977, CVE-2014-9978, CVE-2014-9979, CVE-2014-9980, and CVE-2014-9731 as being present in Qualcomm closed source components and kernel. Based on the associated bulletin, they are listed to highlight that those fixes are included in the current android security patch level.",
    "weaknesses": "The document implies that the listed CVEs are present due to vulnerabilities in Qualcomm's closed-source components and kernel. However, no specific vulnerability details are provided. The CVEs are linked to closed source components that do not provide further vulnerability information in this document.",
    "impact": "Based on the document and listed vulnerabilities, the impacts may include elevation of privilege (EoP) which could lead to a malicious local application executing arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. It can also lead to Information Disclosure (ID) which can allow malicious apps to disclose information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector for EoP vulnerabilities is local, requiring a malicious application to be installed on the device. For Remote Code Execution (RCE) it is a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code. ",
    "required_capabilities": "For local exploitation, a malicious application needs to be installed on the device. For RCE, the attacker would need the ability to send a specially crafted file to the target device.",
     "additional_information": "The document does not provide the specific technical details for any of the CVEs. It primarily serves to acknowledge the existence of the vulnerabilities and indicate their resolution in the respective Android security patch levels. A common pattern identified is that an attacker can execute arbitrary code with a crafted file, either as a local or remote attacker."
