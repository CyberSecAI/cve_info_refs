Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9938:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `git-prompt.sh` script, which is used to display Git branch information in shell prompts, did not properly sanitize branch names before including them in the `$PS1` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script failed to properly escape or sanitize special characters within branch names. Specifically, it did not account for shell metacharacters.
*   **Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious Git branch name containing shell metacharacters and command substitutions (e.g., `$(command)`), an attacker could inject arbitrary commands into the user's shell prompt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A user navigating to a malicious Git repository, with their shell configured to display the current branch name in the prompt, could have arbitrary commands executed on their system, triggered when the shell tried to expand the `$PS1` variable. This could potentially lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Git Repository:** An attacker creates a Git repository with a specially crafted branch name containing malicious shell code.
*   **User Interaction:** A user clones or navigates to the malicious repository using a terminal with a vulnerable shell configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a Git repository with a malicious branch name.
*   The attacker is not required to have direct access to the target system. They rely on the user interacting with their malicious repository through the Git client.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable `git-prompt.sh` script uses the branch name directly in the `$PS1` variable when used with PROMPT_COMMAND, which gets evaluated by the shell before being displayed.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user's shell attempts to display the current branch name, leading to unintended execution of commands embedded in specially crafted branch names.
*   The fix involves using an intermediate shell variable to hold the branch name and correctly escaping special characters when inserting it in the PS1 variable.
*   The vulnerability only affects users who use the `git-prompt.sh` in the PROMPT_COMMAND, and not when used in the PS1 variable, using a command substitution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:2004) addresses this vulnerability by updating the Git package, patching `git-prompt.sh` to properly handle branch names.
*   The provided Git commit (8976500cbbb13270398d3b3e07a17b8cc7bff43f) details the upstream fix for this vulnerability by introducing a temporary variable to hold the branch name, and ensuring it is properly escaped for insertion into the prompt.

**Mitigation**
The vulnerability was mitigated by updating the git package to at least version `1.9.3`, which contains the fix from [8976500cbbb13270398d3b3e07a17b8cc7bff43f](https://github.com/git/git/commit/8976500cbbb13270398d3b3e07a17b8cc7bff43f)
