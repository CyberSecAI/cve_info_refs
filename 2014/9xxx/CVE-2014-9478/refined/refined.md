Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Special:ExpandTemplates` feature in the MediaWiki `ExpandTemplates` extension parses user-provided input as wikitext and displays a preview. However, it lacks an edit token in the form and does not validate it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** When the `$wgRawHtml` setting is enabled, the lack of an edit token allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript, into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can execute in the context of a user's browser when they access the `Special:ExpandTemplates` page.
*   This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   The vulnerability was noted to allow an attacker to perform CORS requests against other Wikimedia sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a URL to the `Special:ExpandTemplates` page with a malicious `wpInput` parameter containing the desired HTML and JavaScript payload.
*   The provided example demonstrates this vulnerability: `http://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ExpandTemplates&wpInput=%3Chtml%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E%3C/html%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special permissions or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker can simply craft a URL and trick a user into visiting the malicious link.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `$wgRawHtml` setting is enabled.
*   The vulnerability affects the 1.19 and 1.22 branches of the `ExpandTemplates` extension.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding an edit token to the form and checking it.
*   The issue is tracked as bug T73111 in the Wikimedia Phabricator.
*   Patches were created for the REL1\_19, REL1\_22, and REL1\_23 branches of the `ExpandTemplates` extension.
