    "ID": "CVE-2014-9436",
    "content": "The provided content describes an unauthenticated arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability in SysAid Server versions prior to 14.4.2. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to download sensitive files from the server including the database files that store user credentials, and potentially gain access to Active Directory.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the `getRdsLogFile` functionality within SysAid server which allows for arbitrary file retrieval without authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Unauthenticated file disclosure.\n    *   Lack of input sanitization on the file name parameter.\n    *   Exposure of sensitive data in database files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Disclosure of sensitive information including user credentials and password hashes.\n    *   Potential compromise of SysAid user accounts.\n    *   Possible access to the entire Active Directory or domain admin privileges when SysAid is configured to use LDAP authentication.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n    *   HTTP requests to the `getRdsLogFile` endpoint with a crafted `fileName` parameter.\n    *   No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Network access to the SysAid server.\n    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.\n\nThe provided example demonstrates how to use `wget` to exploit the vulnerability, downloading the `ilient.mdf` and `ilient_log.LDF` database files. It also notes that SysAid encrypts the LDAP password with a static key that is the same for all instances of the software, which further aggravates the impact."
