{
  "CVE-2014-9296": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-389",
      "Description": "A missing return statement in the receive() function could potentially allow a remote attacker to bypass NTP's authentication mechanism.",
      "CVSS": {
        "Base Score": 5.0,
        "Vector": "(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)"
      }
    },
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a missing return statement in the `receive()` function within `ntp_proto.c`. When a specific error occurs, the code path fails to terminate, potentially leading to further unintended processing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
       "Missing return statement in error code path"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially bypass the authentication mechanism. However, the specific exploit and impact on system integrity are not fully proven or understood. The risk is considered low because exploitation is difficult and the impact is limited, with no observed compromise of confidentiality or integrity.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via crafted NTP packets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated attacker",
      "Ability to send crafted NTP packets"
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.",
      "The vulnerability is fixed in NTP version 4.2.8.",
       "The vulnerability could be mitigated by removing or commenting out configuration directives that begin with the crypto keyword in `ntp.conf`."
