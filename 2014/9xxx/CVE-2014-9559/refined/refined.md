Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-9559

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `snipsnap-search` page, specifically with the `query` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-79:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (Cross-site Scripting).
*   The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `query` parameter in the `snipsnap-search` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Defacement of the website.
*   Theft of user credentials and sensitive information.
*   Malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the `query` parameter of the `/snipsnap-search` URL.
*   The application fails to sanitize this input, and the attacker's code is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing the crafted URL. This could be through social engineering tactics, or by embedding the malicious link in another website or email.

**Affected Versions:**
*   SnipSnap versions: 0.5.2a, 1.0b1, and 1.0b2
