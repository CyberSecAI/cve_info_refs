Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-9705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `enchant_broker_request_dict` function within the `enchant` extension of PHP. This occurs due to incorrect handling of memory when creating multiple dictionaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap-based buffer overflow: The `enchant_broker_request_dict` function does not properly manage the size of a heap buffer, allowing data to be written beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a PHP application to crash by triggering the buffer overflow which leads to a denial of service.
*   Arbitrary code execution: In some scenarios, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network access.
*   Specially crafted input:  The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted input that causes the `enchant` extension to create multiple dictionaries and overflow a heap buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Remote attacker: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `enchant` extension.
*   No authentication: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects PHP versions prior to 5.4.38, 5.5.x before 5.5.22, and 5.6.x before 5.6.6.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `ext/enchant/enchant.c` file of the PHP source code.
*   Patches and updates were released by various vendors, including Ubuntu, SUSE and Red Hat, to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.
