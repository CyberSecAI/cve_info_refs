Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['gpid']` parameter in the `view.php` file of the Google Document Embedder WordPress plugin. This parameter is directly used in an SQL query without being escaped or validated, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET['gpid']`) into a SQL query without any form of sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database compromise:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, configuration data, and other potentially valuable information.
    - Modify or delete data within the database, leading to data loss or corruption.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the WordPress site or server hosting the database.
- **Data exfiltration:** The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how an attacker can extract user credentials (specifically `user_pass`) from the `wp_users` table.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `view.php` file of the plugin, specifically targeting the `gpid` parameter.
- An attacker can craft a URL like: `http://wordpress-install/wp-content/plugins/google-document-embedder/view.php?embedded=1&gpid=0 UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, CONCAT(CAST(CHAR(97, 58, 49, 58, 123, 115, 58, 54, 58, 34, 118, 119, 95, 99, 115, 115, 34, 59, 115, 58) as CHAR), LENGTH(user_pass), CAST(CHAR(58, 34) as CHAR), user_pass, CAST(CHAR(34, 59, 125) as CHAR)) FROM \`wp_users\` WHERE ID=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `view.php` file.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided content includes a code snippet that shows the vulnerable code in `view.php`:
    ```php
    if ( isset( $_GET['gpid'] ) ) {
        if ( $profile = gde_get_profile( $_GET['gpid'] ) ) {
            $tb = $profile['tb_flags'];
            $vw = $profile['vw_flags'];
            $bg = $profile['vw_bgcolor'];
            $css = $profile['vw_css'];
        }
    }
    ```
- The `gde_get_profile` function in the same file is also provided:
    ```php
    function gde_get_profile( $id ) {
        global $wpdb;
        $table = $wpdb->prefix . 'gde_profiles';

        $profile = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $table WHERE profile_id = $id", ARRAY_A );
        $profile = unserialize($profile[0]['profile_data']);

        if ( is_array($profile) ) {
            return $profile;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 2.5.15 of the plugin.
- The changeset log shows a fix where the `$_GET['gpid']` is sanitized before being used in the sql query using `mysql_real_escape_string`.
