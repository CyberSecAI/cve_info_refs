- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HMM software allows an operator to use the `IPMICommand` to send commands to the iMana software. The vulnerability lies in the fact that this communication channel does not enforce proper privilege checks, allowing the operator to send commands that modify iMana user configurations, effectively escalating their privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to insufficient access control on commands sent via IPMI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An operator with access to the HMM software can modify the user configuration of the iMana software, potentially gaining full control over the iMana interface and its managed server resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the HMM software's `IPMICommand` interface. An attacker must first gain legitimate access to the HMM software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid operator account on the HMM software. No other special capabilities or prior access is described.
