Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the TP-Link TL-WR740N router's web server (httpd) failing to handle a specific HTTP GET request properly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of a specific HTTP GET request by the webserver.
- Lack of input validation for the 'isNew' parameter in the 'PingIframeRpm.htm' script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The router's httpd service crashes, making the admin control panel management interface inaccessible.
- Legitimate users are unable to manage the router or access its settings.
- The router requires a physical reboot to restore normal functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the router's web server.
- Specifically, resending the value 'new' to the 'isNew' parameter in the 'PingIframeRpm.htm' script through a proxy.
- The attack is conducted over the default TCP port 80.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, typically implying the attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the router.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects specific firmware versions of the TP-Link TL-WR740N router.
- The exploit involves sending a crafted GET request with specific parameters to the router's web server.
- The vendor did not respond to the vulnerability report before public disclosure.
