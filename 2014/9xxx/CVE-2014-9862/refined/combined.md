bspatch: Add a sanity-check for malformed patches.

This patch adds an extra sanity-check for malformed patches. A
corrupted patch should be cached by update_engine before reaching
this step anyway.

BUG=chromium:372525
TEST=emerge-link bsdiff && chroot/build/link/usr/bin/bspatch foo bar malformed_patch
bspatch segfaults without the patch and shows the error message with it.

Corrected:      2016-07-25 14:52:12 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-BETA2-p1)                 2016-07-25 14:52:12 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-BETA1-p1)                 2016-07-25 14:53:04 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)                 2016-07-25 15:04:17 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p6)                 2016-07-25 15:04:17 UTC (releng/10.2, 10.2-RELEASE-p20)                 2016-07-25 15:04:17 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p37)                 2016-07-25 14:53:04 UTC (stable/9, 9.3-STABLE)                 2016-07-25 15:04:17 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p45) CVE Name:       CVE-2014-9862  For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the following sections, please visit <URL:<https://security.FreeBSD.org/>>.  I.   Background  The bspatch utility generates newfile from oldfile and patchfile where patchfile is a binary patch built by bsdiff(1).  II.  Problem Description  The implementation of bspatch does not check for a negative value on numbers of bytes read from the diff and extra streams, allowing an attacker who can control the patch file to write at arbitrary locations in the heap.  This issue was first discovered by The Chromium Project and reported independently by Lu Tung-Pin to the FreeBSD project.  III. Impact  An attacker who can control the patch file can cause a crash or run arbitrary code under the credentials of the user who runs bspatch, in many cases, root.  IV.  Workaround  No workaround is available.  V.   Solution  Perform one of the following:  1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.  No reboot is needed.  2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:  Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:  # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install  No reboot is needed.  3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:  The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches.  a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.  # fetch [https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:25/bspatch.patch](https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16%3A25/bspatch.patch) # fetch [https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:25/bspatch.patch.asc](https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16%3A25/bspatch.patch.asc) # gpg --verify bspatch.patch.asc  b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:  # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch  c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as described in <URL:<https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>>.  VI.  Correction details  The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each affected branch.  Branch/path                                                      Revision - ------------------------------------------------------------------------- stable/9/                                                         r303301 releng/9.3/                                                       r303304 stable/10/                                                        r303301 releng/10.1/                                                      r303304 releng/10.2/                                                      r303304 releng/10.3/                                                      r303304 stable/11/                                                        r303300 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------  To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a machine with Subversion installed:  # svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base  Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:  <URL:<https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=NNNNNN>>  VII.

CVE Name: CVE-2014-9862
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The bspatch utility generates newfile from oldfile and patchfile where
patchfile is a binary patch built by bsdiff(1).
II. Problem Description
The implementation of bspatch does not check for a negative value on numbers
of bytes read from the diff and extra streams, allowing an attacker who
can control the patch file to write at arbitrary locations in the heap.
This issue was first discovered by The Chromium Project and reported
independently by Lu Tung-Pin to the FreeBSD project.
III. Impact
An attacker who can control the patch file can cause a crash or run arbitrary
code under the credentials of the user who runs bspatch, in many cases, root.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
No reboot is needed.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
No reboot is needed.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:25/bspatch.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:25/bspatch.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bspatch.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

X41 D-SEC GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2020-006

Advisory X41-2020-006: Memory Corruption Vulnerability in bspatch
=================================================================
Severity Rating: High
Confirmed Affected Versions: Colin Percival's bsdiff 4.3
Confirmed Patched Versions: FreeBSD's bsdiff
(<https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/usr.bin/bsdiff/bspatch/bspatch.c>)
Vendor: Colin Percival
Vendor URL: <https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/>
Vendor Reference: None
Vector: Patch file
Credit: X41 D-SEC GmbH, Luis Merino
Status: Public
CVE: CVE-2020-14315
CWE: 119
CVSS Score: N/A
CVSS Vector: N/A
Advisory-URL: <https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2020-006-bspatch/>

Summary and Impact
==================
A memory corruption vulnerability is present in bspatch as shipped in
Colin Percival’s bsdiff tools version 4.3. Insufficient checks when
handling external inputs allows an attacker to bypass the sanity
checks in place and write out of a dynamically allocated buffer
boundaries.

Even though the patching procedure is usually combined with integrity
and authenticity checks, an attacker that is able to deliver a
malicious patch can cause heap corruption in the process running
bspatch code, when the authenticity checks happen after applying the
patches. Depending on their ability to control and shape the heap
state before and during the processing of a malicious patch file,
remote code execution may be achieved. This has already been
demonstrated
(<https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e48209b03f1dd9625a992717e7b89c4f#file-freebsd-txt-L1192>)
as a proof-of-concept exploit in 2016 by an anonymous author against
the FreeBSD bspatch implementation on 32bit architectures.

This issue was initially reported for bspatch in bsdiff “as used in
Apple OS X before 10.11.6 and other products” with CVE-2014-9862 by an
anonymous researcher and was partially addressed by several projects,
including Android
([https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bsdiff/+/4d054795b673855e3a7556c6f2f7ab99ca509998%5E%21/#F0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bsdiff/%2B/4d054795b673855e3a7556c6f2f7ab99ca509998%5E%21/#F0)),
ChromiumOS
(<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issue/detail?id=372525>) and
FreeBSD
([https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16%3A25.bspatch.asc))
during 2016. This initial batch of fixes prevented the attack via
negative control values.

Nevertheless, huge control values that would integer overflow the
sanity checks and allow an attacker writing out of bounds were not
fixed. A subsequent patch was released by FreeBSD
([https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:29.bspatch.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16%3A29.bspatch.asc))
addressing the remaining issues together with additional hardening.
Unfortunately, most of bspatch copies didn’t port this fix.

It is worth mentioning that bsdiff 4.3, as hosted at Colin Percival’s
bsdiff website <https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/>, still ships a copy
of bspatch.c vulnerable to these issues via both negative and huge
control values. All the Linux distributions we have checked shipping
bsdiff are building from this sources, with some of them applying the
partial fix initially released.

Product Description
===================
bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to
binary files. They provide an efficient way to apply binary patches
for applications update mechanisms.

Analysis
========
Insufficient checks when calculating the buffer offset and size of
write operations allows writing out of a heap allocated buffer boundaries.

- -
-
------------------8<---------------------------------------------------------
    while(newpos<newsize) {
        /* Read control data /
        for(i=0;i<=2;i++) {
            lenread = BZ2bzRead(&cbz2err, cpfbz2, buf, 8);
            if ((lenread < 8) || ((cbz2err != BZOK) &&
                (cbz2err != BZSTREAMEND)))
                errx(1, "Corrupt patch\n");
            ctrl[i]=offtin(buf);
        };
        / Sanity-check */
        if(newpos+ctrl[0]>newsize)
            errx(1,"Corrupt patch\n");
    /* Read diff string */
    lenread = BZ2_bzRead(&dbz2err, dpfbz2, new + newpos, ctrl[0]);
- -
-
------------------8<---------------------------------------------------------

When ctrl[0] takes either negative values or big enough values to
overflow newpos+ctrl[0], the sanity check in place will pass allowing
operations that write out of buffer new boundaries via BZ2_bzRead().
It is worth mentioning that BZ2_bzRead() will truncate ctrl[0] from
64-bit off_t to 32-bit int.

It is expected that an attacker that is able to deliver an specially
crafted patch file can gain remote code execution capabilities when
certain conditions for exploitation are met.

Workarounds
===========
As a workaround, only patches passing integrity and authenticity
checks should be applied.

| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3-r4** |

### Background

bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary
files.

### Description

It was discovered that the implementation of bspatch did not check for a
negative value on numbers of bytes read from the diff and extra streams.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to apply a specially crafted patch
using bspatch, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binary diff users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/bsdiff-4.3-r4"

```

X41 D-SEC GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2020-006

Advisory X41-2020-006: Memory Corruption Vulnerability in bspatch
=================================================================
Severity Rating: High
Confirmed Affected Versions: Colin Percival's bsdiff 4.3
Confirmed Patched Versions: FreeBSD's bsdiff
(<https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/usr.bin/bsdiff/bspatch/bspatch.c>)
Vendor: Colin Percival
Vendor URL: <https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/>
Vendor Reference: None
Vector: Patch file
Credit: X41 D-SEC GmbH, Luis Merino
Status: Public
CVE: CVE-2020-14315
CWE: 119
CVSS Score: N/A
CVSS Vector: N/A
Advisory-URL: <https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2020-006-bspatch/>

Summary and Impact
==================
A memory corruption vulnerability is present in bspatch as shipped in
Colin Percival’s bsdiff tools version 4.3. Insufficient checks when
handling external inputs allows an attacker to bypass the sanity
checks in place and write out of a dynamically allocated buffer
boundaries.

Even though the patching procedure is usually combined with integrity
and authenticity checks, an attacker that is able to deliver a
malicious patch can cause heap corruption in the process running
bspatch code, when the authenticity checks happen after applying the
patches. Depending on their ability to control and shape the heap
state before and during the processing of a malicious patch file,
remote code execution may be achieved. This has already been
demonstrated
(<https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e48209b03f1dd9625a992717e7b89c4f#file-freebsd-txt-L1192>)
as a proof-of-concept exploit in 2016 by an anonymous author against
the FreeBSD bspatch implementation on 32bit architectures.

This issue was initially reported for bspatch in bsdiff “as used in
Apple OS X before 10.11.6 and other products” with CVE-2014-9862 by an
anonymous researcher and was partially addressed by several projects,
including Android
([https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bsdiff/+/4d054795b673855e3a7556c6f2f7ab99ca509998%5E%21/#F0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bsdiff/%2B/4d054795b673855e3a7556c6f2f7ab99ca509998%5E%21/#F0)),
ChromiumOS
(<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issue/detail?id=372525>) and
FreeBSD
([https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16%3A25.bspatch.asc))
during 2016. This initial batch of fixes prevented the attack via
negative control values.

Nevertheless, huge control values that would integer overflow the
sanity checks and allow an attacker writing out of bounds were not
fixed. A subsequent patch was released by FreeBSD
([https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:29.bspatch.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16%3A29.bspatch.asc))
addressing the remaining issues together with additional hardening.
Unfortunately, most of bspatch copies didn’t port this fix.

It is worth mentioning that bsdiff 4.3, as hosted at Colin Percival’s
bsdiff website <https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/>, still ships a copy
of bspatch.c vulnerable to these issues via both negative and huge
control values. All the Linux distributions we have checked shipping
bsdiff are building from this sources, with some of them applying the
partial fix initially released.

Product Description
===================
bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to
binary files. They provide an efficient way to apply binary patches
for applications update mechanisms.

Analysis
========
Insufficient checks when calculating the buffer offset and size of
write operations allows writing out of a heap allocated buffer boundaries.

- -
- -
-
------------------8<---------------------------------------------------------
    while(newpos<newsize) {
        /* Read control data /
        for(i=0;i<=2;i++) {
            lenread = BZ2bzRead(&cbz2err, cpfbz2, buf, 8);
            if ((lenread < 8) || ((cbz2err != BZOK) &&
                (cbz2err != BZSTREAMEND)))
                errx(1, "Corrupt patch\n");
            ctrl[i]=offtin(buf);
        };
        / Sanity-check */
        if(newpos+ctrl[0]>newsize)
            errx(1,"Corrupt patch\n");
    /* Read diff string */
    lenread = BZ2_bzRead(&dbz2err, dpfbz2, new + newpos, ctrl[0]);
- -
- -
-
------------------8<---------------------------------------------------------

When ctrl[0] takes either negative values or big enough values to
overflow newpos+ctrl[0], the sanity check in place will pass allowing
operations that write out of buffer new boundaries via BZ2_bzRead().
It is worth mentioning that BZ2_bzRead() will truncate ctrl[0] from
64-bit off_t to 32-bit int.

It is expected that an attacker that is able to deliver an specially
crafted patch file can gain remote code execution capabilities when
certain conditions for exploitation are met.

Proof of Concept
================
A crashing reproducer can be downloaded from
<https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/blob/master/X41-2020-006/x41-2020-006-bspatch-poc.patch>

Fix
===
Please, refer to the FreeBSD advisories
[https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch.asc](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16%3A25.bspatch.asc)

for fixes.

Workarounds
===========
As a workaround, only patches passing integrity and authenticity
checks should be applied.

## Binary packages built by this source

[bsdiff](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/bsdiff):
generate/apply a patch between two binary files

bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary files.

 By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and Sadakane's qsufsort) and

 taking advantage of how executable files change, bsdiff routinely produces

 binary patches 50-80% smaller than those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller

 than those produced by .RTPatch (a commercial patch tool).

[bsdiff-dbgsym](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/bsdiff-dbgsym):
