ICS Advisory
# Schneider Electric ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 29, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-020-02

## OVERVIEW

Narendra Shinde of Qualys Security has identified multiple vulnerabilities in Schneider Electric’s ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway. Schneider Electric has produced a firmware update that mitigates part of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway’s are affected:

* TSXETG3000 all versions,
* TSXETG3010 all versions,
* TSXETG3021 all versions, and
* TSXETG3022 all versions.

## IMPACT

The vulnerabilities allow unauthorized remote access to the gateway’s files and FTP account.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Schneider Electric corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in 190 countries worldwide.

The affected product, ETG3000 FactoryCast HMI Gateway, is a web-based SCADA system. According to Schneider Electric, these gateways are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Schneider Electric estimates that these products are used globally.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### UNAUTHENTICATED ACCESSCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.

Access to the rde.jar file containing configuration details is accessible without authentication. This could allow an attacker access to information on the setup and configuration of the gateway.

CVE-2014-9197NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9197, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.

### FTP HARD-CODED CREDENTIALSCWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.

The ftp server of the device has hard-coded credentials. This could allow the attacker to access the service without proper authentication.

CVE-2014-9198NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9198, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory.has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).CVSS Calculator, http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C, web site last accessed January 20, 2015.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Schneider Electric has produced an updated firmware, labelled V1.60 IR 04. This firmware release moves the jar files directory in a secure area. The new firmware also includes the ability to disable the FTP server. This updated firmware can be downloaded at:

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/download/WW/EN/details/681790255-TSXETG30xx-V160-IR4/?showAsIframe=true&reference=ETG30xxV160-IR04>

Schneider Electric recommends the FTP server be deactivated when not needed. The firmware update does not remove the hard-coded credentials.

Narendra Shinde also found that configuration files were accessible using default credentials. Schneider Electric recommends users change the default login credentials. This will protect configuration files from unauthorized access.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
