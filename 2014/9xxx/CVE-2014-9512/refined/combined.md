| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-08-05 07:22:23 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Michael Samuel discovered that rsync was vulnerable to checksum collisions. This could prevent  rsync from running and syncing files successfully, which could break various applications that use  and rely on rsync.  Details are available in the original report:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/07/28/1>  This will require work with upstream to bring in Michael's proposed libdetectcoll and blake2b  changes/get rsync to use something other than MD5.   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-04-05 23:33:07 UTC  ``` Upstream Fix:  <https://git.samba.org/?p=rsync.git;a=commit;h=eac858085e3ac94ec0ab5061d11f52652c90a869>  This fix was included in 3.1.2 release.  Added to existing GLSA. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2016-05-30 20:02:22 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201605-04 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201605-04> by GLSA coordinator Yury German (BlueKnight). ``` |  |

The countermeasure was implemented for the new incremental recursive algorithm (inc-recurse) only. The new algorithm is used by the default since rsync 3.0. However both server and client must support protocol >= 30.  A malicious server can bypass the symlink check by negotiating a protocol version < 30. Thus it can still overwrite arbitrary files (although with \0 bytes it seems, needs more investigation) ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=915410#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2016-01-19 11:40:24 UTC  ``` <http://xteam.baidu.com/?p=169> has ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=915410#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-19 23:11:44 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2016:0173-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

The countermeasure was implemented for the new incremental recursive algorithm (inc-recurse) only. The new algorithm is used by the default since rsync 3.0. However both server and client must support protocol >= 30.  A malicious server can bypass the symlink check by negotiating a protocol version < 30. Thus it can still overwrite arbitrary files (although with \0 bytes it seems, needs more investigation) ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=915410#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2016-01-19 11:40:24 UTC  ``` <http://xteam.baidu.com/?p=169> has ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=915410#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-19 23:11:44 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2016:0173-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.
