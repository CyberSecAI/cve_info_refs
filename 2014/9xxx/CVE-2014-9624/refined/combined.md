| Summary | 0017984: CVE-2014-9624: CAPTCHA bypass is way easier than it should be | | | | |
| Description | One can get an unlimited amount of "samples" with different perturbations for the same challenge... which makes the whole captcha utterly useless and very easy to bypass.  Solutions involve either caching the captcha or changing the challenge | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | 1) load the following in a browser tab <https://bugs.freenetproject.org/signup_page.php>  2) load this in a new tab <https://bugs.freenetproject.org/make_captcha_img.php>  3) refresh the second tab until you're 100% confident your poor OCR got it right | | | | |

By seeding the random number generator, we ensure that the generated CAPTCHA is always the same for a given private key.  The commit also removes several unnecessary calls to srand().

As Florent pointed out, the cure was worse than the disease as it reduced the effective number of distinct captchas to a mere 2^31, making it easy for an attacker to precompute the lot to bypass the challenge.  In addition, debug mode now works in context of make_captcha_img.php, i.e. it doesn't set the image/jpeg content type header, and displays the generated captcha as an image within an html page.

One can pre-compute the whole lot and instantly lookup the challenge...  The proposed cure looks worst than the disease in this case...  Please credit "Florent Daigniere from Matta Consulting" |

One can pre-compute the whole lot and instantly lookup the challenge...  I didn't think about that.  Seeding the RNG sounded like a simple and effective approach, but I guess it was just too easy ;-)  The only alternative I can think of ATM (short of changing the whole captcha code, which is not worth the effort as we're switching to a new one in 1.3 anyway) would be to cache the generated image in the user's session. Thoughts ? |

As I was testing this code, I noticed a regression bug in the 1.2.18 captcha validation, which was also reported by another user (see [0017993](/bugs/view.php?id=17993 "[closed] User creation with captcha broken by fix for issue #17811")), you might want to check out the fix in the proposed pull request [1] too (feedback welcome).

If what you're trying to avoid is session fixation attacks, changing the session identifier is the only thing that needs to happen... there's no need to void the content of the session itself (that's what session\_regenerate\_id() does) |

I would move the session\_delete before the trigger\_error() call in signup.php  Makes sense, will do.  I'm not sure I understand why the session is trashed in the first place.  I'm not sure either, tbh... Never touched this code before.  My understanding is that signing up implies logging out of Mantis, which is necessary because when signing up, someone may currently be logged in, either as anonymous or less likely as themselves (in which case signup\_page.php needs to be accessed manually). I think it makes sense to clear the session's contents when logging out.  Does that make sense to you ? |

For the rest not really. Traditionally applications allow concurrent sessions for users... anonymous/guest sessions are handled the same way... and that allows for "upgrading" an unauthenticated session to an authenticated one (sessions are independent so there's no problem there).  I suspect that Mantis sessions aren't handled that way... whether it makes sense to change it for this stable branch I'm not sure ^-^ |

Cache the generated CAPTCHA to ensure uniqueness

```
Prior to this, the code would be the same but the displayed CAPTCHA
would vary slightly with each call to make_captcha_img.php, allowing an
attacker unlimited attempts to train their OCR software to decode the
image.

This issue was reported by Florent Daignière from Matta Consulting.

In addition, CAPTCHA debug mode now works in make_captcha_img.php's
context, i.e. it doesn't set the image/jpeg content type header, and
displays the generated captcha as an image within an html page.

Fixes #17984

Cache the generated CAPTCHA to ensure uniqueness

```
Prior to this, the code would be the same but the displayed CAPTCHA
would vary slightly with each call to make_captcha_img.php, allowing an
attacker unlimited attempts to train their OCR software to decode the
image.

This issue was reported by Florent Daignière from Matta Consulting.

In addition, CAPTCHA debug mode now works in make_captcha_img.php's
context, i.e. it doesn't set the image/jpeg content type header, and
displays the generated captcha as an image within an html page.

Fixes #17984

Use CVE-2014-9624.  (Although 17984 apparently was not publicly accessible
until 2015, the 39a92726 commit appears to have been uploaded to GitHub on
December 29, 2014, and it clearly describes a security issue.  Therefore a
2014 ID is used.)

Cache the generated CAPTCHA to ensure uniqueness

```
Prior to this, the code would be the same but the displayed CAPTCHA
would vary slightly with each call to make_captcha_img.php, allowing an
attacker unlimited attempts to train their OCR software to decode the
image.

This issue was reported by Florent Daignière from Matta Consulting.

In addition, CAPTCHA debug mode now works in make_captcha_img.php's
context, i.e. it doesn't set the image/jpeg content type header, and
displays the generated captcha as an image within an html page.

Fixes #17984
