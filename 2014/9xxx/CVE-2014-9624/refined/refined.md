{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CAPTCHA image was not unique per user session. The CAPTCHA image was generated using a random number generator seeded with a value that only varied slightly on each request. This allowed an attacker to generate multiple CAPTCHA images for the same challenge, making it easy to bypass the CAPTCHA with OCR software by training on the multiple variants of a single challenge. Additionally, seeding the RNG with a simple integer further reduced the keyspace, making it feasible to precompute CAPTCHAs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient randomness in CAPTCHA generation",
      "Lack of session-based uniqueness for CAPTCHA images"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could easily bypass the CAPTCHA mechanism, potentially leading to unauthorized account creation or other malicious activities that depend on CAPTCHA verification.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability could be exploited by repeatedly loading the CAPTCHA generation script to obtain multiple variants of the same challenge, which could then be used to train OCR software to recognize the pattern. Alternatively an attacker could pre-compute all CAPTCHAs since the random number generator is seeded with low entropy value.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to access the CAPTCHA generation script and submit signup requests. No special system privileges are needed."
