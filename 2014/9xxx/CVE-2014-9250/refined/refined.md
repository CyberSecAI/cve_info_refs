Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-9250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure cookie authentication. The authentication cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on the authentication cookie. This allows access to the cookie via client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can retrieve the authentication cookie can determine the user's username and password. With this information, the attacker can impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to the Zenoss system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could use a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, if present, to steal the cookie.
- An attacker who has access to the user's browser or machine could retrieve the cookie.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted traffic (HTTP) could also expose the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a way to retrieve the authentication cookie from the user's browser. This could be achieved through:
  - Exploiting an XSS vulnerability.
  - Having access to the user's computer or browser.
  - Intercepting network traffic if the site is using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided spreadsheet indicates that this issue is marked as CLOSED with no planned product change, with a recommendation to use SSL/HTTPS.

This vulnerability is related to a lack of secure cookie handling and could lead to user impersonation if exploited.
