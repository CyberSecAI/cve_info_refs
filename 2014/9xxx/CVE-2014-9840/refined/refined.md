Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of PSD (Photoshop Document) files. Specifically, it involves issues with throwing exceptions and a memory leak during PSD file processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Exception Handling:** The code had issues related to throwing exceptions during PSD file processing, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
- **Memory Leak:** A memory leak occurred in the PSD file handling code, potentially leading to resource exhaustion over time if the vulnerable code is repeatedly used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting the exception handling issue could lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior.
- The memory leak could lead to denial of service if an attacker can repeatedly trigger the vulnerable code, eventually exhausting available memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted or corrupted PSD file that triggers the exception handling issues and the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to provide a malicious PSD file to the vulnerable ImageMagick instance. This could involve:
    - Uploading a malicious image to a web server that uses ImageMagick for image processing.
    - Tricking a user into opening a malicious image using an application that relies on ImageMagick.
