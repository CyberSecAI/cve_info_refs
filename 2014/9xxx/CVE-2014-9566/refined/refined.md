```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The 'sort' and 'dir' parameters in the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints of the AccountManagement.asmx service in Solarwinds Orion Platform are vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of proper input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to privilege escalation by inserting a new admin user, data exfiltration or modification. The attacker can also cause denial of service by using time-based injections.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending crafted requests to the GetAccounts or GetAccountGroups endpoints with malicious SQL payloads in the 'sort' or 'dir' parameters."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. It can even be the default Guest account, which has no password by default and is enabled.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is exploitable even with the guest account due to a lack of ACL checks on the vulnerable endpoints. The Metasploit module leverages this to create a new admin user using a stacked query injection. Boolean-based, time-based and stacked SQL injection techniques are possible through this vulnerability. The vulnerability affects multiple Solarwinds products using the core Orion service."
