Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9419:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `__switch_to` function in `arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c` of the Linux kernel. This function is responsible for switching between processes, and it failed to ensure that Thread Local Storage (TLS) descriptors were loaded before performing other actions related to segment registers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect TLS Handling:** The kernel did not load TLS descriptors correctly during context switching, specifically before actions involving segment registers, potentially leading to corrupted stack data.
- **ASLR Bypass:** Due to the incorrect TLS handling, a local attacker could leak the user space TLS base address of an arbitrary process, facilitating Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage**: An unprivileged local user can leak the user space TLS base address of an arbitrary process.
- **ASLR Bypass**: The leaked information can be used to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Crafted Application:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability using a crafted program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local user access**: Ability to execute code on the targeted system.
- **Knowledge of vulnerability:** Understanding of how the TLS descriptor loading is mishandled during context switching and how to manipulate the flawed code using `SYS_set_thread_area`.
