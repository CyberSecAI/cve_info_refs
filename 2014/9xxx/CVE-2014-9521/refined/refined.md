The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the InfiniteWP Admin Panel.

**Issue 1: login.php unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** User-controlled parameter `email` is used in a SQL query without proper escaping. The `filterParameters()` function does not perform escaping because `$DBEscapeString` is set to false.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection due to lack of proper input sanitization/escaping.
*  **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated HTTP requests to `login.php`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with a malicious `email` parameter.

**Issue 2: execute.php unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** User-controlled parameters `historyID` and `actionID` are used in a SQL query without proper escaping. The `filterParameters()` function does not perform escaping because `$DBEscapeString` is set to false. Also, the `historyID` parameter appears without quotes in the SQL query.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection due to lack of proper input sanitization/escaping.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated HTTP requests to `execute.php`.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with malicious `historyID` and `actionID` parameters.

**Issue 3: uploadScript.php unrestricted file upload vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated users can upload arbitrary file types, including PHP files, to the uploads directory if the `allWPFiles` parameter is set. Although filenames are suffixed with `.swp`, this can lead to PHP code execution if the web server is misconfigured.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unrestricted file upload, leading to potential PHP code injection.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated HTTP requests to `uploadScript.php` with the `allWPFiles` parameter set.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with a file to upload and the `allWPFiles` parameter. The webserver must interpret `.php.swp` as PHP.

**Issue 4: Insecure password storage**
*   **Root Cause:** Passwords are stored as unsalted SHA1 hashes in the `iwp_users.password` field.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use of unsalted SHA1 hashes for password storage.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can easily crack these passwords, leading to unauthorized access to the admin panel.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Access to the database containing user hashes.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Access to the database or the ability to retrieve password hashes (e.g. by exploiting another vulnerability).
