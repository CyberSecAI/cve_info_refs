Onapsis Security Advisory ONAPSIS-2014-034: SAP Business Objects Search
Token Privilege Escalation via CORBA

1. Impact on Business
=====================

By exploiting this vulnerability a remote and potentially
unauthenticated attacker would be able to access or modify any
information stored on the SAP BusineesObjects server.
The attacker could also connect to the business systems depending on the
configuration of the BO infrastructure.

Risk Level: Critical

2. Advisory Information
=======================

- - Public Release Date: 2014-12-16
- - Subscriber Notification Date: 2014-12-16
- - Last Revised: 2014-12-14
- - Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2014-034
- - Onapsis SVS ID: ONAPSIS-00121
- - CVE: CVE-2014-9320
- - Researcher: Will Vandevanter, Juan Perez-Etchegoyen
- - Initial Base CVSS v2: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

3. Vulnerability Information
============================

- - Vendor: SAP
- - Affected Components:
  * BussinessObjects Edge 4.1
    (Check SAP Note 2039905 for detailed information on affected releases)

- - Vulnerability Class: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)

- - Original Advisory:
<http://www.onapsis.com/resources/get.php?resid=adv_onapsis-2014-034>

4. Affected Components Description
==================================

SAP Business Objects allows a remote user, potentially using a Guest
account if enabled, to perform CORBA calls to resources that should be
restricted by correctly checking the privileges of the user performing
the request.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

Using CORBA calls it is possible to escalate privileges from any valid
user to System privileges in BusinsessObjects. The System Account can
perform any action in BusinessObjects.

An unauthenticated attacker (if Guest user is enabled, so no credentials
are required) can obtain the SI_PLATFORM_SEARCH_SERVER_LOGON_TOKEN via
CORBA. This token can be used, also via CORBA, to perform actions as
SYSTEM, thus escalating privileges.

6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2039905 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2039905>

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
