Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an off-by-one error in the `pcf_get_properties` function within the `pcf/pcfread.c` file of FreeType. Specifically, a size value (0xffffffff) is read from a crafted PCF file and then improperly incremented. This increment leads to an integer overflow when allocating memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** When a 0xffffffff size value is read from a PCF file and then incremented, an integer overflow occurs due to the 32 bit limit. This overflow results in a zero-sized buffer allocation.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The memory allocation functions within FreeType return NULL when the allocation size is zero.  This NULL pointer is then dereferenced later in the code, causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service, manifested as a NULL pointer dereference and application crash.  This means that software that relies on FreeType to render fonts could terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a specially crafted PCF font file with a malicious size value (0xffffffff), which triggers the integer overflow in the `pcf_get_properties` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** A remote attacker needs to provide a crafted PCF file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User interaction:** A user must open or process the malicious font file using a program utilizing a vulnerable FreeType library for the attack to succeed.

**Additional notes:**

*   The bug report from Red Hat Bugzilla #1191094 states that the issue is an integer overflow, rather than an off-by-one as stated by the CVE description.
*   The issue was introduced as a side effect of a fix for CVE-2012-1130.
*   A regression was found in the original fix that caused some PCF fonts not to load and was fixed in later commits.
*   Red Hat's RHSA-2015:0696 security advisory states that the vulnerability was corrected through backported patches.

In summary, CVE-2014-9671 details an exploitable integer overflow flaw in FreeType that can lead to a denial of service. This flaw is triggered when processing a specially crafted PCF font file. The vulnerability is addressed in FreeType version 2.5.4.
