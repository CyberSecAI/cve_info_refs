{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `member_download` task within the Cart66 plugin. The plugin uses `$_GET['path']` to determine the file path for download without sufficient sanitization. Specifically, it only attempts to remove `../` and `./` from the path using `str_replace`, but doesn't account for other potential path traversal attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability: The plugin fails to properly sanitize the file path provided by the user.",
       "Insecure Direct Object Reference: The plugin directly uses the user provided path to fetch files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to the disclosure of configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to the WordPress site with the `task=member_download` parameter and a malicious `path` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the member download functionality of the plugin. They also need knowledge of the directory structure of the server to construct the malicious path."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The plugin sanitizes the requested file path in the member download functionality to prevent path traversal attacks.",
    "The plugin now uses `str_replace(array('../','./'),'',$_GET['path'])` to sanitize the path provided by the user, mitigating the path traversal vulnerability. "
