Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-9050:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in ClamAV's PE file scanning functionality. This occurs when scanning specially crafted, crypted Portable Executable (PE) files, specifically those using the y0da Crypter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the PE file parsing/scanning code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) of the ClamAV scanner.
- It's also possible, though not explicitly confirmed, that the vulnerability could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code due to the nature of buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by scanning a maliciously crafted PE file that has been obfuscated with the y0da Crypter.
- Attackers need to provide ClamAV with a specially crafted PE file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs the ability to submit a malicious file for scanning by ClamAV. This could be through various channels depending on ClamAVâ€™s use case (e.g. email attachment scanning, file upload).
- No special privileges are needed, the vulnerability is present in the scanning logic.

**Additional details:**
-  The vulnerability was fixed in ClamAV version 0.98.5.
- The fix is part of a commit: `fc3794a54d2affe5770c1f876484a871c783e91e`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Damien Millescamp of Oppida.
- The patch involves changes to `libclamav/pe.c`, which is related to Portable Executable file parsing.
- The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper bounds checking or size validation during PE file processing when encountering a specific condition within the section headers. The fix involves adding checks to avoid reading beyond the end of a file when parsing section headers.

The provided information gives a good understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, and its potential impact, as well as the affected software versions. It also provides details about the fix and affected components.
