Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-9305

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Cart66Ajax::shortcodeProductsTable()` function within the Cart66 Lite WordPress plugin.
- Specifically, the `$postId` variable, which is taken from user input, is not properly escaped before being used in a SQL query. It only strips html tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.
- The injection point is within the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query which retrieves products, `where id=$postId`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials and other stored data.
- An attacker can potentially modify the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `shortcode_products_table` and a malicious `id` parameter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a registered user of the WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the target website's `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject a time-based blind SQL injection. This allows attackers to infer information by observing the server's response time.
- The vulnerable version of the plugin is 1.5.1.17.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.2 of the plugin.
- The plugin is now closed and no longer available for download.
