Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9028:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_residual_partitioned_rice_` function of the libFLAC decoder. This occurs when processing specially crafted .flac files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow.  The decoder attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size, leading to corruption of the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This is mentioned in several sources.
- Crash/Denial of service. If code execution is not achieved the heap overflow may cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted .flac files.  The primary attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted .flac file to a system for decoding using the vulnerable libFLAC library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to deliver a malicious .flac file to be processed by vulnerable software.  This could be through various means, including user download, network transfer, or embedding the file within a website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team.
- The fix for the heap overflow was introduced with the upstream commit: <https://git.xiph.org/?p=flac.git;a=commit;h=fcf0ba06ae12ccd7c67cee3c8d948df15f946b85>
- Some sources suggest the initial fix for this issue wasn't fully complete and a second fix was needed, but this was resolved by commit: <https://git.xiph.org/?p=flac.git;a=commit;h=5a365996d739bdf4711af51d9c2c71c8a5e14660>
- Affected products include, but are not limited to: various distributions of Linux, embedded systems and applications that use the vulnerable library.
