The content is related to CVE-2014-9119.

- **Root cause:** The `download.php` script in the DB Backup plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize user input, specifically path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). The `readfile()` function is used without sanitizing its input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `wp-config.php` which contains WordPress authentication keys, salts, and database credentials. This could lead to privilege escalation and execution of malicious PHP code in certain environments.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `download.php` script with a malicious `file` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior authentication.
