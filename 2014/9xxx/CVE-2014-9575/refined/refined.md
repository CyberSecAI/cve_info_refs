The provided content describes multiple critical vulnerabilities in VDG Security SENSE (formerly DIVA) version 2.3.13.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerabilities stem from a combination of insecure coding practices, flawed authentication mechanisms, and the use of plain text protocols. Specific issues include:

*   **Insecure web server implementation:** allowing arbitrary file downloads.
*   **Authentication bypass:** Inadequate handling of HTTP Authorization headers.
*  **Hardcoded credentials:** The presence of default, unchangeable credentials for the PostgreSQL database and local Windows users.
*   **Information disclosure:** Unrestricted access to the user database via the proprietary protocol.
*   **Lack of encryption:** Use of plain text protocols for all communication.
*   **Buffer overflow:** Vulnerability in the web service API's user authentication processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Local File Disclosure:** Arbitrary files can be read from the filesystem with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Certain parts of the application lack proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to configuration settings.
*   **Clear Text Password Disclosure:** Configuration files and plugin settings contain clear text passwords.
*   **Insecure Service Configuration:** The PostgreSQL database is accessible remotely with hardcoded credentials that cannot be changed.
*   **Hardcoded Default Credentials:** Several Windows users created during the DIVA setup have hardcoded passwords.
*  **User Database Leakage:** The user database, including password hashes, is leaked upon successful authentication, regardless of user privileges.
*   **Use of Plain Text Protocols:**  All communication channels lack encryption.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The web service API is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow during user authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain system-level access.
*  **Lateral Movement/Privilege Escalation:** The compromised server can be used as an entry point to other systems.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information, including user credentials, configuration data, and password hashes, can be exposed.
*   **Service Disruption:** Attackers can modify plugin configurations.
*  **Loss of Confidentiality:** Due to the use of clear text protocols.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the proprietary web server and web service API using specially crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Network Access:** Exploiting the exposed PostgreSQL database and the DIVA's proprietary protocol via network connections.
*   **Local Access:** Utilizing the default Windows user credentials to gain access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the VDG SENSE server.
*  **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  For exploiting web-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** For exploiting the database and Windows user vulnerabilities.
*  **Ability to Connect to Proprietary Protocol:** To leverage the user database leakage.
