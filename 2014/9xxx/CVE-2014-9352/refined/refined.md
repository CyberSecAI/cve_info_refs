Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. XML External Entity Injection (XXE)**

*   **Root cause:** The Scalix Web Access XML parser resolves external XML entities.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The application processes XML input without properly sanitizing it, allowing for the inclusion of external entities.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An unauthenticated attacker can gain read access to the filesystem of the Scalix Mail Server host.
    *   Sensitive information such as configuration files can be obtained.
    *   Internal port scanning is possible.
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the affected host.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a specific handler (details removed).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing valid user credentials or authentication.

**2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root cause:** The Scalix mail administration login panel reflects user-supplied parameters without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input in a specific script.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include malicious HTML or JavaScript code, which is then executed within the browser of users who visit the manipulated URL.
*   **Attack vectors:** Manipulated URL containing malicious code via specific script (details removed).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user to visit the manipulated URL to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Information:**
