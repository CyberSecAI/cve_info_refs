Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the "Web Site" input field within the profile section of the Social Microblogging PRO 1.5 application. This field does not properly sanitize or filter user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Web Site" field. This code is then stored in the application's database and executed whenever a user views the profile, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This can have a wide range of impacts, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript payload through the vulnerable "Web Site" input field in the profile settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account to access and modify the profile settings.
- No special privileges or elevated access is required.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable "Web Site" input field.
