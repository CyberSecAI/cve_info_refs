Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `name` and `url` parameters within the `Extension:Listings` of MediaWiki. This lack of validation allows for the injection of arbitrary URLs, including those with the `javascript:` scheme, and arbitrary HTML into the `name` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious URLs in the `url` parameter or HTML in the `name` parameter can be injected. Specifically:
    *   The `url` parameter allows `javascript:` URLs, leading to script execution.
    *   The `name` parameter allows for reflected/stored XSS through HTML injection, such as `<script>alert(2)</script>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying page content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `buy` tag within the `Extension:Listings`, where a crafted `name` or `url` parameter is included. For example:
    *   `<buy name="<script>alert(2)</script>">anything</buy>`
    *   `<buy name="asdf" url="javascript:alert(1)" >anything</buy>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or edit content using the `buy` tag within MediaWiki. This would typically require a valid user account with the necessary permissions to modify pages utilizing the `Listings` extension.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding validation to the URL parameters and sanitizing the `name` parameter to prevent XSS.
*   Patches were created and applied across multiple MediaWiki versions including master, REL1_22, REL1_23 and REL1_24 branches
*   The issue was initially reported as allowing arbitrary URLs, including javascript: URLs, in the extension. However, further investigation found that the "name" parameter also allowed for XSS.
