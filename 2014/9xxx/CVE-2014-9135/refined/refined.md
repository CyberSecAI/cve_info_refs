Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-9135

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `PackageInstaller` module of the Huawei P7 smartphone. Specifically, it stems from an insufficient validity check when installing third-party applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application installation process does not properly verify the source of the application package.
- The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the validity check by manipulating specific information within the malware package. This allows the device to consider the package as downloaded from a whitelisted source, which it is not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is that malicious applications can be installed without any warning or notification to the user.
- Once installed, the malware could perform any malicious actions it is designed for.
- The bypass of security checks could lead to data theft, system compromise, or other harmful effects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves tricking users into installing a malicious application package. This could be achieved through various means, such as social engineering, phishing emails, or distributing malware through untrusted sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be able to create a malicious application package.
- An attacker must be able to trick the user into downloading and installing this malicious package from outside of trusted sources like the official application store.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities within the PackageInstaller module to manipulate the package in order to bypass the validity check.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Huawei P7-L10 smartphone and older versions.
- Huawei has released a software update (V100R001C00B136) to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Information Security Lab of National Tsing Hua University.
- The CVSS v2 base score for the vulnerability is 7.5, indicating a high-severity vulnerability.
- The attack requires user interaction to install the malicious app, but after that no user input is required.
