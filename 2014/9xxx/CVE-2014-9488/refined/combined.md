## [less out of bounds read access - TFPA 002/2014](/3-less-out-of-bounds-read-access-TFPA-0022014.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Sunday, November 30. 2014

An out of bounds read access in the UTF-8 decoding can be triggered with a malformed file in the tool less. The access happens in the function is\_utf8\_well\_formed (charset.c, line 534) due to a truncated multibyte character in the sample file. It affects the latest upstream less version 470. The bug does not crash less, it can only be made visible by running less with valgrind or compiling it with Address Sanitizer. The security impact is likely minor as it is only an invalid read access.

This issue has been found with the help of Address Sanitizer.

The upstream developers have been informed about this issue on 4th November 2014, no fix is available yet. The less webpage has no bug tracker, no open mailing list and no other way to publicly report and document bugs.

**Conclusion**

Even tools that only do very minor file parsing can expose bugs due to charset encoding, especially in multibyte characters. Please note that the bigger security threat in less comes from the use of lesspipe.

It is unsettling that the upstream project of an important tool like less is completely unresponsive to bugs and has no public way to discuss them.

[CVE-2014-9488](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9488)

**Update 2014-12-15:** less released a new version 471 and this issue is **not** fixed.

**Update 2015-03-10:** Version 475 of less contains a fix for this issue. I never received any reply from the developers.

less doesn't have public release announcements or a repository, so it's hard to track their changes. The file version.c contains some entry mentioning this issue (without any credit):

*v475 3/2/15 Fix possible buffer overrun with invalid UTF-8*

The fix is in the file charset.c. [Here is a patch.](/uploads/less-CVE-2014-9488-utf8-overflow.diff "less-CVE-2014-9488-utf8-overflow.diff")

**Update 2015-06-03:** It has been pointed out in the comments that the patch I provided was wrong (it was an unrelated fix for another issue). I have replaced it with the correct patch now. Also for clarification it should be pointed out that the latest "stable" version (according to the less webpage) 458 is not affected.

#### stsp on Wednesday, June 3. 2015:

The bug was in the utf\_bin\_count() function in charset.c, not line.c.

The patch you've linked shows another caller of is\_utf8\_well\_formed that was updated to pass a new parameter but is otherwise unrelated to the problem.

Thanks for noting that, you are right. I've replaced the patch with the correct one now and added an update notice.
