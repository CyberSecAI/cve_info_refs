Vulnerability title: Multiple Instances Of Cross-site Scripting In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-2045
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

        The data supplied to both the `old' and `new' web applications (the device has two web based management
interfaces) was permanently stored and could be retrieved later by other users. This is a normal feature of many
applications, however, in this instance the application failed to restrict the type of data that could be stored and
also failed to sanitise it, meaning that it could not be safely rendered by the browser.

        Stored cross-site scripting could be triggered by:

                Attempting to login with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>' (affects `old' interface and results
in post-authentication cross-site Scripting when a legitimate administrator views the realtime log)
                Creating an account with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>' (affects both `old' and `new'
interfaces once created)
                Setting the device's hostname to `<script>alert(1)</script>'  (affects `old' interface once created)

        A number of locations were identified as being vulnerable to reflective attacks, including:

http://<host>/exec?module=config&sessionid=<sessionid>&inspect=%3Cscript%20src=<http://localhost:9090%3E%3C/script%3E>
http://<host>/exec?tool=atcommands&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&commands=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
http://<host>/exec?tool=ping&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&host=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&pingcount=3&databytes=56

        The inclusion of session IDs in all URLs partially mitigates the reflective cross-site scripting but could
itself be considered a vulnerability since it is included in referred headers and log files.

        These are simply some examples of how this attack might be performed, and the it is believed that both the
`old' and `new' web applications are systemically vulnerable to this.

Vulnerability title: Remote SSL VPN Endpoint Identity Not Verified In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-9754, CVE-2014-9755
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

        In order for the hardware VPN client on the affected device to establish a VPN channel it connects to the
remote VPN endpoint and initiates an SSL connection using TLSv1.1. It then initiates the following exchange (protocol
version 2):

client> VERSION 3
server> ERROR
client> VERSION 2
server> +OK Protocol version 2 chosen
client> TUNNEL test
server> +OK Tunnel chosen
client> PASS test
server> +OK You are now authenticated
client> CHANNEL test
server> +OK Channel selected
client> DATA

        The hardware VPN client does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the
endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange.

        In this example, we perform a downgrade attack from protocol version 3 to protocol version 2, however as noted
in the impact, version 3 of the protocol is similarly affected.

        Note: MITRE have assigned CVE-2014-9754 to reference the missing certificate validation and CVE-2014-9755 to
reference the protocol downgrade attack.

# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

## Using Fulldisclosure
