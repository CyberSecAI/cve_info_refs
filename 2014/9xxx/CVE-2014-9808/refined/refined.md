Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a flaw in ImageMagick's handling of corrupted DPC (Display PostScript) image files. Specifically, the software crashes when processing a corrupted DPC image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Crash/SEGV:** The primary vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV), indicating a memory access violation that leads to a crash. This occurs when ImageMagick attempts to process a DPC image that has been corrupted or is malformed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the ImageMagick application. Repeated crashes can lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable for legitimate use.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or corrupted DPC image file. An attacker would need to supply a malicious image file to ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Upload/Processing:** The attacker would need the ability to provide input to the vulnerable application, specifically a malformed DPC image. This could involve uploading the image to a web application or having it processed via a command-line interface where ImageMagick is used.
*   **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation of the vulnerability does not appear to require any special privileges, as the application crashes due to a processing error rather than a privilege escalation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The upstream patch for this issue is available at: `<https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/imagemagick.git/commit/?h=debian-patches/6.8.9.9-4-for-upstream&id=82f779cbc24045af2eaecb95d0842ca7b97c71f4>`.
*   This CVE was assigned as a result of a security audit of ImageMagick, where multiple vulnerabilities were discovered.

In summary, CVE-2014-9808 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick that allows a remote attacker to cause a crash by providing a specially crafted DPC image file, leading to a denial of service.
