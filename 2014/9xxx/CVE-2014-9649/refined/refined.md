Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-9649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of error responses by the RabbitMQ management plugin's API. When an invalid URL under `/api/...` was requested, the server would generate an internal server error. This error response was formatted as an HTML page, embedding the unescaped text from the malformed URL directly into the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input (the URL) in the error response allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the HTML page.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The server's behavior of returning HTML for API errors, rather than a structured format like JSON, is a significant weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code. If a user, particularly an administrator, clicked on such a link, the injected script would execute within their browser session, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Unauthorized actions on the RabbitMQ management interface.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through maliciously crafted URLs targeting the `/api/...` endpoint. These URLs could be delivered to victims via:
    *   Phishing emails.
    *   Compromised websites.
    *   Other forms of social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker only needs the ability to craft a specific URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing that URL to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability existed since RabbitMQ 2.1.0.
*   The fix involved ensuring all `/api` endpoints returned `application/json` content type responses, even for errors.
*   The fix was implemented in RabbitMQ 3.4.1 and later.
*   Red Hat backported patches to address the vulnerability.
