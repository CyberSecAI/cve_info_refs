Message-ID: <54BFF440.7070001@canonical.com>

Subject: CVE Request: XSS and response-splitting bugs in rabbitmq management
 plugin

Hello,

The following issues were fixed in RabbitMQ 3.4.1:

(as described in
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/-3Z2FyGtXhs> )

26437 prevent /api/* from returning text/html error messages which could
       act as an XSS vector (since 2.1.0)
26433 fix response-splitting vulnerability in /api/downloads
       (since 2.1.0)

Bug 26437 allowed an attacker to create a URL to "/api/..." which would
provoke an internal server error, resulting in the server returning an
html page with text from the URL embedded and not escaped. This was
fixed by ensuring all URLs below /api/ only ever return responses with a
content type of application/json, even in the case of an internal server
error.

Bug 26433 allowed an attacker to specify a URL to /api/definitions which
would cause an arbitrary additional header to be returned. This was
fixed by stripping out CR/LF from the "download" query string parameter.

Fixed by:
<https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/commit/b5a5fc31bd49ad821a655ea9e2fe920d670a62ad>

Could CVEs please be assigned to these issue?

Thanks,

Marc.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1185514#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-24 05:14:10 UTC  ``` 26437 prevent /api/* from returning text/html error messages which could act as an XSS vector (since 2.1.0)   [Bug 26437](show_bug.cgi?id=26437 "CLOSED NOTABUG - XFree86 server seems highly unstable") allowed an attacker to create a URL to "/api/..." which would  provoke an internal server error, resulting in the server returning an  html page with text from the URL embedded and not escaped. This was  fixed by ensuring all URLs below /api/ only ever return responses with a  content type of application/json, even in the case of an internal server  error.

## Synopsis

Moderate: rabbitmq-server security and bugfix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0308)

## Topic

Updated rabbitmq-server packages that fix two security issues and a bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

RabbitMQ is an implementation of AMQP, the emerging standard for high
performance enterprise messaging. The RabbitMQ server is a robust and
scalable implementation of an AMQP broker.

A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in RabbitMQ, which
allowed using api/ path info to inject and receive data. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to create an "/api/..." URL, forcing a
server error that resulted in the server returning an HTML page with
embedded text from the URL (not escaped). (CVE-2014-9649)

A response-splitting vulnerability was discovered in RabbitMQ. An
/api/definitions URL could be specified, which then caused an arbitrary
additional header to be returned. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and possibly gain access to secure data.
(CVE-2014-9650)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, if the rabbit\_mirror\_queue\_master did not return when using

HA and 'auto\_delete' queues, the RabbitMQ server blocked channels during
termination. These channels would then have no associated connections and
were displayed as 'unknown'. This issue has been resolved. (BZ#1303747)

All rabbitmq-server users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
