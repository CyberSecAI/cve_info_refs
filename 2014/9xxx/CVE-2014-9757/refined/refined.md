Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-9757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2014-9757 is the use of an outdated version of the Smack XMPP library within Atlassian Bamboo. This old version of the library improperly deserializes XMPP messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is that the vulnerable version of the Smack library deserializes XMPP messages without proper validation, allowing for the injection of malicious serialized data. This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server running the vulnerable Bamboo instance. This gives the attacker complete control over the compromised system.
*   **Critical Severity:** Atlassian has rated this vulnerability as "critical," emphasizing the severity of the potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XMPP Message Manipulation:** An attacker needs to be able to modify XMPP messages that are destined for the vulnerable Bamboo instance. This implies a man-in-the-middle attack on XMPP communication, or possibly compromising the XMPP server itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the XMPP server that is configured to communicate with the vulnerable Bamboo instance.
*   **XMPP Message Interception/Modification:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify XMPP messages before they reach the Bamboo server. This could involve compromising the XMPP server or performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
*  **XMPP Configuration:** A XMPP connection must be configured on the Bamboo server in order for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Affected Product and Versions:**

*   **Product:** Atlassian Bamboo
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of Bamboo from 2.4 before 5.9.9 (the fixed version for 5.9.x) are vulnerable.

**Fix Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Bamboo versions 5.9.9 and 5.10.0.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability is related to BAM-17099 in Atlassian's Jira.
*   The advisory also mentions two other vulnerabilities that were addressed in the same fix. CVE-2015-8360 (Deserialization in Bamboo) and CVE-2015-8361 (Missing authentication checks in exposed services). These are separate vulnerabilities but were fixed in the same release.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to version 5.9.9 or higher.
*   The advisory also warns of a bug in Bamboo 5.9.9 that affects builds using git over SSH, which was fixed in 5.9.10.
