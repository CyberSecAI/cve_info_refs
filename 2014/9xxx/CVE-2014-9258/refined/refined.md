Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-9258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `$_GET['condition']` parameter in `ajax/getDropdownValue.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Specifically, the code uses `rawurldecode` and `stripslashes` which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection. The unsanitized input is directly concatenated into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification
  - Potential for privilege escalation, depending on the context of the SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `ajax/getDropdownValue.php` script, specifically manipulating the `condition` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is within a script accessed by logged-in users.
- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP GET parameters.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is present in GLPI versions before 0.85.1.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided which uses the `SLEEP()` function to demonstrate a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to update to version 0.85.1 or apply a backported patch to earlier versions of GLPI.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Mageia by backporting the patch from Fedora and releasing `glpi-0.84.3-1.2.mga4`.
