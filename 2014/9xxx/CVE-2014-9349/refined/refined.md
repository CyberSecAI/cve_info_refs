Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `robots.lib.php` file of RobotStats v1.0. Specifically, the script does not filter HTML code in the `nom` (name) and `user_agent` parameters before inserting them into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is HTML injection. Arbitrary HTML code can be injected into the `nom` and `user_agent` fields via the `robots.php` administration page due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The provided text also mentions "no security for admin folder (session control, login panel or anyone...)". This is not part of the described HTML injection vulnerability but points to a lack of authentication mechanism for the admin panel and is a separate issue.
*   **XSS Possibility:** While the text describes HTML injection, it is implied that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is also possible. The injected HTML can include JavaScript, which would enable XSS attacks, though this is not directly stated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Content Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content, potentially altering the visual appearance of the `info-robot.php` and `admin/robots.php` pages. This includes redirecting users or displaying malicious content.
*   **XSS Execution:** If JavaScript is injected, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, and other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/robotstats/admin/robots.php` endpoint. Specifically, the `rub=ajouter` parameter allows for creating new robots. The `nom` and `user_agent` parameters in the query string contain the malicious HTML/JavaScript payload.
*   **Direct Access to Admin Panel:** As the advisory points out, lack of proper authentication for the admin panel allows direct access for any attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable RobotStats application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL endpoint (`/robotstats/admin/robots.php`) and how to form a crafted request with the injected payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Due to the lack of proper security controls on the admin panel, the attacker doesn't need prior access or valid admin login credentials to access the vulnerable page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject HTML using GET parameters.
*   The vulnerable parameters are `nom` and `user_agent`.
*   The injected HTML will be displayed on `/robotstats/info-robot.php` and `/robotstats/admin/robots.php` after submitting.
*   The exploit-db entry is more detailed than the official CVE description, specifically regarding the location of the vulnerable code and parameters.

This analysis provides a clear view of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how to exploit it.
