    "ID": "CVE-2014-9471",
    "content": "The `parse_datetime()` function in coreutils has flaws that can be exploited if `date` or `touch` (or other programs using the function) accept untrusted input for specific parameters.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of user-supplied input in the `parse_datetime()` function.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n  - Improper input validation in `parse_datetime()`\n  - Memory corruption due to a double free or invalid pointer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n  - Denial of Service (DoS) via a crash.\n  - Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable process (though not explicitly proven by the provided content).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n  - Command-line arguments to `date` and `touch` utilities, specifically the `--date` parameter, with a crafted timezone string (e.g., `TZ="123"345"`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n  - Ability to provide crafted command-line arguments to the vulnerable applications.\n  - Local access is sufficient to trigger the DoS. Remote exploitation is also possible if the application using the vulnerable code is exposed to remote input.\n\n**Additional details:**\n  - The vulnerability was independently discovered by Bertrand Jacquin and Fiedler Roman, and reported to the GNU bug tracker.\n  - The vulnerability can be triggered with commands like `touch '--date=TZ="123"345" @1'` and `date '--date=TZ="123"345" @1'`.\n  - The provided patches aim to fix the issue by adding better input validation to the `parse_datetime()` function, preventing the double free.\n",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was found while fixing PHP session cleanup code running with root privileges, which could allow passing arbitrary parameters to touch.\n\nMultiple sources confirm the described issue as CVE-2014-9471. Patches are available in associated bug reports and advisories. The vulnerability was reported to affect versions of coreutils prior to 8.23, with a resolution involving upgrades to the affected packages."
