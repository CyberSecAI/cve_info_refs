Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An integer underflow in the `ksba_oid_to_str()` function within the libksba library. This underflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when processing malformed Object Identifiers (OIDs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The code doesn't properly validate the input OID encoding, which allows an attacker to craft input that causes an integer underflow during the conversion process.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The integer underflow results in calculating an incorrect, excessively large size for a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when writing the OID string representation into it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause the application using libksba to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the primary impact is DoS, the possibility of arbitrary code execution cannot be completely ruled out, as overwriting memory in a heap-based overflow can potentially overwrite critical data structures. This is noted as "unlikely but cannot be ruled out" by the original researcher.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted S/MIME Messages:** Exploiting this vulnerability is possible by using specially crafted S/MIME messages that contain malformed OIDs.
*   **ECC-Based OpenPGP Data:** The vulnerability can also be triggered by processing malformed ECC-based OpenPGP data containing crafted OIDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with specially crafted input, such as S/MIME messages or OpenPGP data.
*   No special access or privileges appear to be required; the vulnerability can be triggered by a user or an external entity that can provide the malicious data to a system using the library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in libksba versions prior to 1.3.2.
*   It affects applications that use libksba, including `gpgsm` and `dirmngr` which are part of GnuPG.
*   The issue was discovered through fuzzing.
*   The fix for this issue involves properly checking the OID encoding and performing bounds checks before converting OIDs to their string representation.
