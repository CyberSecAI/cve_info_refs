| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14663#c0)  David Walser    2014-11-26 14:42:14 CET  ``` A CVE has been assigned for an issue fixed in libksba 1.3.2: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/26/3>  Freeze push requested for Cauldron.  Updated package uploaded for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4.  libksba is used through gnupg2, so that's what you need to use to test this.  We have a gnupg test procedure; you just need to use "gpg2" instead of "gpg" as the command to test gnupg2: [https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11306#c3](show_bug.cgi?id=11306#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - gnupg2 new security issue CVE-2013-4351")  This probably isn't the most serious issue in the world, but the testing procedure is quick and easy, so if we're able to get it tested today, then great.  Advisory: ========================  Updated libksba packages fix security vulnerability:  By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based OpenPGP data, it is possible to create a buffer overflow, which could lead to a denial of service (CVE-2014-9087).

Package        : libksba
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9087
Debian Bug     : 770972

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the ksba_oid_to_str() function of libksba, an X.509 and CMS
(PKCS#7) library. By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based
OpenPGP data, it is possible to create a buffer overflow, which could
cause an application using libksba to crash (denial of service), or
potentially, execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-2+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.3.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libksba packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2427-1: Libksba vulnerability

27 November 2014

Libksba could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libksba](/security/cves?package=libksba) - X.509 and CMS support library

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Buffer overflow and other minor issues in GnuPG and libksba - TFPA 001/2014](/2-Buffer-overflow-and-other-minor-issues-in-GnuPG-and-libksba-TFPA-0012014.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Wednesday, November 26. 2014

Fuzzing GnuPG uncovered a couple of issues with potential security impact. All issues found with american fuzzy lop and Address Sanitizer.

**Buffer Overflow in OID decoding**

A Buffer Overflow has been found in the OID decoding function with malformed OIDs. The code is shared between GnuPG and libksba. libksba is used for OID decoding by gpgsm and dirmngr. In GnuPG the error can be triggered by using the --list-packets parameter on the fuzzing sample.

The bug can be used for Denial of Service. Code execution is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.

Affected are GnuPG 2.1.0 and its beta versions and all libksba versions before 1.3.2. The issue is fixed in libksba 1.3.2 and will be fixed in the soon to be released GnuPG 2.1.1. GnuPG 2.0.x and 1.x versions are not affected.

[CVE-2014-9087](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9087)

**Multiple invalid memory access issues**

Malformed packets can cause access to uninitialized variables and an off by one access with --list-packets. A NULL pointer dereference can happen on --verify (already independently discovered and fixed). A malformed encrypted packet causes a call to BUG() (no security impact, just a funny error message). Likely all minor issues.

All issues have been privately reported to GnuPG developer Werner Koch on 2014-11-23/24/25 who quickly fixed them.

**Conclusion**

More people should fuzz GnuPG.

```
Hello!

I am pleased to announce version 1.3.2 of Libksba.

This is a *security fix* release and all users of Libksba should update
to this version.  Note that GnuPG 2.x makes use of Libksba and thus all
user of GnuPG 2.x need to install this new version of libksba and at
least restart the dirmngr process.

Libksba is an X.509 and CMS (PKCS#7) library.  It is for example
required by the S/MIME part of GnuPG-2 (gpgsm and dirmngr).  The only
build requirement for Libksba itself is the libgpg-error package.  There
are no other dependencies; actual cryptographic operations need to be
done by the user.  Libksba is distributed under the LGPLv3+/GPLv2+.
There are no user tools accompanying this software, thus it is mostly
relevant to developers.

You may download the library and its OpenPGP signature from:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.3.2.tar.bz2     (587k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.3.2.tar.bz2.sig

The SHA-1 checksum is

37d0893a587354af2b6e49f6ae701ca84f52da67  libksba-1.3.2.tar.bz2

Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.2
===================================

 * Fixed a buffer overflow in ksba_oid_to_str.

Impact of the security bug
==========================

By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based OpenPGP data, it
is possible to create a buffer overflow.  The bug is not easy to exploit
because there only 80 possible values which can be used to overwrite
memory.  However, a denial of service is possible and someone may come
up with other clever attacks.  Thus this should be fix.

Affected versions: All Libksba versions < 1.3.2

Background: Yesterday Hanno Böck found an invalid memory access in the
2.1 branch of GnuPG by conveying a malformed OID as part of an ECC key.
It turned out that this bug has also been in libksba ever since and
affects at least gpgsm and dirmngr.  The code to convert an OID to its
string representation has an obvious error of not considering an invalid
encoding for arc-2.  A first byte of 0x80 can be used to make a value of
less then 80 and we then subtract 80 from it as required by the OID
encoding rules.  Due to the use of an unsigned integer this results in a
pretty long value which won't fit anymore into the allocated buffer.
The actual fix for lib Libksba is commit f715b9e.

Support
=======

For help on developing with Libksba you should read the included manual
and optional ask on the gnupg-devel mailing list [1].  A listing with
commercial support offers for GnuPG and related software is available at
the GnuPG web site [2].

The driving force behind the development of GnuPG is my company g10 Code
GmbH.  Maintenance and improvement of GnuPG and related software takes
up most of my time.  To allow me to continue this work, I kindly asks to
either purchase a support contract, engage g10 Code for custom work, or
to donate money:

  <https://gnupg.org/donate/>

Thanks
======

Thanks to Hanno Böck for taking the time to run fuzzing tests on GnuPG
and reporting them.

Happy hacking,

  Werner

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
