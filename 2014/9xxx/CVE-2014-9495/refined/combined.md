# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - July 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016

Thank you for clarifying.

CVE-2014-9495 remains associated with the png_combine_row() issue found by
John Bowler.  We will update its description and references if needed.

Use CVE-2015-0973 for the png_read_IDAT_data/png_handle_IHDR issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: libpng 1.6.15 Heap Overflow

I thought it might be helpful to add some additional clarity to this bug.
There were two bugs patched in the latest updates to libpng. The first
bug is an overflow in png_read_IDAT_data, and is triggerable due to
checks on image width that were removed a while ago in libpng branches
1.6.x and 1.5.x. This is the bug against which the following write up
applies: <http://tfpwn.com/files/libpng_heap_overflow_1.6.15.txt> .
While fixing this bug, John Bowler found a second, unrelated overflow in
png_combine_row. His mailing list post on that bug is found here:
<http://sourceforge.net/p/png-mng/mailman/message/33172831/> . It looks
like CVE-2014-9495 was assigned against this bug, but attributed to me
by accident.
As the fixes to either bug don't fix the other, there are actually two
overflows that need to be tracked for libpng. People backporting changes
should ensure they fix both bugs.
Both of these bugs are evidence of a larger issue in libpng 1.6.x and
1.5.x. Those branches allow abnormally large width and height values. On
64-bit platforms, widths and heights of 0x7fffffff are still allowed.
Somewhat smaller, but abnormally large widths, and still very large
heights, are available on 32-bit platforms. The 1.2.x branch only allows
for the safer values.
Safe limits can be enabled in these libpng branches with
-DPNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED. These limits are not enabled by default.
<http://sourceforge.net/p/libpng/code/ci/libpng-1.6.16-signed/tree/pngpriv.h#l300>
I very strongly recommend individuals building libpng 1.5.x and 1.6.x
use PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED.
