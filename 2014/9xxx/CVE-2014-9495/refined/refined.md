Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9495:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A heap overflow exists in the `png_combine_row` function of libpng.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap overflow in the `png_combine_row` function.
*   Libpng 1.5.x and 1.6.x branches allow abnormally large width and height values, potentially leading to overflows.
*   The `PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED` option to enable safe limits is not enabled by default, further exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Processing a maliciously crafted .png file may lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   Application termination

**Attack vectors:**
*   Processing a specially crafted PNG image

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted PNG image to an application using the vulnerable libpng library

**Additional details:**

*   The CVE was initially assigned against a different overflow in `png_read_IDAT_data`, but was later corrected to refer to the `png_combine_row` issue found by John Bowler.
*   The `png_read_IDAT_data` overflow is tracked under CVE-2015-0973.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in libpng versions 1.6.9-1.6.15, and potentially some revisions of the 1.5 branch.
*   The issues are addressed by updating libpng to version 1.6.16 or later and applying provided patches.
*   It is recommended to build libpng with `PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED` to prevent these issues.
