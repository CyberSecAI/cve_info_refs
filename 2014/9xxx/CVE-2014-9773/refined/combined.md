Subject: CVE request: atheme: security fixes

Hi,

Multiple security issues were found in Atheme, an IRC services package,
which will be fixed in the upcoming 7.2.7 release. Could CVEs be
assigned to the issues summarized below?

Fix:
<https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/c597156adc60a45b5f827793cd420945f47bc03b>
Description: A remote attacker could change Atheme's behavior by
registering/dropping certain accounts/nicks.
Reference: <https://github.com/atheme/atheme/issues/397>

Fix:
<https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/87580d767868360d2fed503980129504da84b63e>
Description: Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could cause
denial of service due to a buffer overflow in the XMLRPC response
encoding code.

Regards,
Max Teufel

# Nick-/ChanServ: Registering "clear", "modify" or "list" breaks /msg ChanServ flags #channel clear/modify/list #397

## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Nov 2, 2014](https://github.com/atheme/atheme/issues/397#issue-47521859)

There is some kind of ironic "Anope compatibility" implemented in ChanServ here:

<https://github.com/atheme/atheme/blob/master/modules/chanserv/flags.c#L195>

It seems to be a feature, but it is completely weird, that any user can register the nicks "clear", "modify" and "list", resulting in a network-widely changed command syntax:

#### before registration:

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel list"

--> shows the flags for #channel

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel modify Username +-modification"

--> modifies the flags for Username on #channel

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel clear"

--> *clears the channel's flags* (!)

#### after registration:

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel list"

--> shows the flags for the user who grouped the nick "list"

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel modify Username +-modification"

--> *[ChanServ] Invalid template name given, use /msg ChanServ TEMPLATE #channel for a list* (!)

"/msg ChanServ flags #channel clear"

--> shows the flags for the user who grouped the nick "clear"

#### issues caused by this behavior:

This is highly theoretical, but it could actually lead to annoyance in certain cases:

* If Alice uses the nick "clear" and the founder of #channel wants to give them privileges, Alice could quickly drop/ungroup their "clear" nick to cause the founder to clear their whole #channel flags list. This can be *very* annoying and hard to restore. As it - as far as I know - also includes all AKICK entries, it could even be abused to cause the founder to unban all people on the AKICK list.
* If there is someone who has a nick that matches a template, the FLAGS MODIFY command can be abused. Let's say someone added "lover" as a template for +AVeiorstv in their #channel (this actually happened). This someone is used to the Anope compatibility syntax and wants to give the user "LoVeR" the +V flag, and nothing more.

This someone now wants to use the following command to first check the current flags of LoVeR:

/msg ChanServ flags #channel modify LoVeR

--> Expected result: [ChanServ] No flags for LoVeR in #channel.

Then they would like to use "/msg ChanServ flags #channel modify LoVeR +V" to give them the needed flag.

However, LoVeR quickly and silently - for example using an identified webchat in the background - groups the "modify" nick to their account. Now someone uses the command:

/msg ChanServ flags #channel modify LoVeR

...to see LoVeR's flags on #channel, as that has always worked like this. They got used to this Anope command syntax and are happy to be able to use it here, too. However, as "modify" is now grouped, the command will produce the following result:

--> [ChanServ] Flags +AVeiorstv were set on LoVeR in #channel.

Whoops, LoVeR got some permissions they should not have received, by changing the behavior of a services command just by grouping the "modify" nick to their account. Before someone understands what happened, LoVeR abuses their privileges.

As I said, it's a highly theoretical issue, but in my opinion, it should be fixed anyway. It should not be possible for users to change the behavior of services commands by registering nicks that happen to match command names.

chanserv/flags: make Anope FLAGS compatibility an option

```
Previously, ChanServ FLAGS behavior could be modified by registering or
dropping the keyword nicks "LIST", "CLEAR", and "MODIFY".
Now, a configuration option is available that when turned on (default),
disables registration of these keyword nicks and enables this
compatibility feature. When turned off, registration of these keyword
nicks is possible, and compatibility to Anope's FLAGS command is
disabled.

Use CVE-2014-9773. We don't completely understand issues/397. We think
"This is rejected for Atheme, please consider reporting it to a
downstream fork instead" means that the vulnerability report was
originally rejected, but that decision was reconsidered many months
later.

> Fix:
> <https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/87580d767868360d2fed503980129504da84b63e>
> Description: Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could cause

Use CVE-2016-4478.

(Incidentally, our understanding is that this code, or at least related
code, is available in the Debian atheme-services package.)
