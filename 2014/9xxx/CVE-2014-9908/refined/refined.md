Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9908:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2014-9908" and describes it as a "Denial of Service vulnerability in Bluetooth" which matches the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability is related to a denial of service issue within the Bluetooth component of Android.
    - Specifically, the vulnerability allows a proximate attacker to block Bluetooth access.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to render the Bluetooth functionality unavailable.
    - The vulnerability lies in the way Android handles Bluetooth connections, potentially during the acceptance of a socket connection.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - A successful exploit results in a denial of service, effectively blocking Bluetooth access on the affected device.
    - The Android security bulletin classifies this as a "High" severity issue due to the possibility of remote denial of service.
  
**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is "proximate", meaning an attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the target device, within Bluetooth range.
    - No specific technical capabilities are detailed beyond the ability to interact with Bluetooth services.

**Additional Details from Content:**
   - The vulnerability affects Android versions 4.4.4, 5.0.2, and 5.1.1.
   - It was reported on May 5, 2014.
   - The fix involves a change in `BluetoothSocket.java`, specifically adding a `try-catch` block around `as.mSocket.closeExternalFd()` to prevent crashes.
