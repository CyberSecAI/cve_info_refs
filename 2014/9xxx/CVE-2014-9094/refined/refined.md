Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the DZS Video Gallery plugin for WordPress:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `preview.php` script within the plugin is vulnerable to XSS via the `swfloc` and `designrand` parameters. These parameters do not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious URLs with injected JavaScript code in the `swfloc` or `designrand` parameters.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

*   **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin leaks the full server path of the application through multiple files, specifically `videogallery.php` and `sliderexport.php`, and potentially other php files or error logs in all folders of the plugin.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the vulnerable files directly through a web browser.
    *   **Impact:** This information can be used by an attacker to gain a deeper understanding of the server's file structure, which can be leveraged in other attacks.

*   **OS Commanding (Remote Code Execution - RCE):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `img.php` script is vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization. By manipulating the `src` parameter with a crafted URL containing OS commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Crafted URLs with OS commands in the `src` parameter of `img.php`, utilizing the method of Pichaya Morimoto.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server via remote code execution.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of the DZS Video Gallery for WordPress are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin with crafted payloads in the query parameters.
*   For RCE, the attacker needs to be able to inject OS commands into the `src` parameter.

**Timeline:**

*   2014.04.24: Vulnerabilities discovered
*   2014.05.08: Announced at websecurity.com.ua
*   2014.05.09: Developer informed, but ignored
*   2014.07.12: Publicly disclosed at websecurity.com.ua

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability information was also disclosed on the Full Disclosure mailing list.
*   The OS Commanding vulnerability leverages a technique previously described by Pichaya Morimoto.
