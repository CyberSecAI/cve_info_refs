- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the failure to sanitize filenames uploaded to the `CollectorConfInfoServlet` servlet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability. Lack of input sanitization on uploaded filenames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on vulnerable ManageEngine NetFlow Analyzer installations.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by uploading malicious files through the `CollectorConfInfoServlet`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability. They need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server.
