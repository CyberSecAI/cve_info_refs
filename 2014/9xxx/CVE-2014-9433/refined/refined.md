Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9433:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the error-handling function of the CMS Contenido software. Specifically, when unexpected values are passed via the `idart`, `lang`, and/or `idcat` parameters to the `front_content.php` script, the application reflects these unsanitized values directly back to the user within the webpage.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through the vulnerable parameters. This injected script would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as changing their settings or data within the CMS.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with XSS payloads embedded within the vulnerable parameters (`idart`, `lang`, `idcat`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL, which could be distributed through various means (e.g., phishing emails, malicious links on other websites). The attacker doesn't need any special access to the web server, just the ability to send a crafted request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs specifically when the "Advanced Mod Rewrite (AMR)" feature is disabled. This feature is used to rewrite URLs for SEO purposes.
*   The vulnerable script is `front_content.php`, located within the `cms` directory of the Contenido installation.

**Payload Examples:**

The provided examples illustrate how an attacker could inject JavaScript code:

*   `http://{IP/HOSTNAME}/cms/front_content.php?idcat=41&lang=1<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
*   `http://{IP/HOSTNAME}/cms/front_content.php?idcat=41<iframe src="some_remote_src" height="200" width="200" ></iframe>&lang=1`
*   `http://{IP/HOSTNAME}/cms/front_content.php?idart=32<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

**Affected Software:**

*   CMS Contenido versions 4.9.x up to 4.9.5.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor released version 4.9.6 to address the issue. Users are advised to update to the latest version to remediate the vulnerability.
