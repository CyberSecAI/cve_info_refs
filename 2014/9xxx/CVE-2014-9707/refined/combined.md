# Advisory: CVE-2014-9707: GoAhead Web Server 3.0.0 - 3.4.1

*From*: Matthew Daley <mattd () bugfuzz com>

```
Affected software: GoAhead Web Server
Affected versions: 3.0.0 - 3.4.1 (3.x.x series before 3.4.2)
CVE ID: CVE-2014-9707

Description: The server incorrectly normalizes HTTP request URIs that
contain path segments that start with a "." but are not entirely equal
to "." or ".." (eg. ".x"). By sending a request with a URI that
contains these incorrectly handled segments, it is possible for remote
attackers to cause a heap overflow with attacker-controlled content or
perform a directory traversal attack.

Fixed version: 3.4.2
Bug entry: <https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/issues/106>
Fix: <https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/commit/eed4a7d177bf94a54c7b06ccce88507fbd76fb77>
Reported by: Matthew Daley

Detail:

The vulnerability lies in the websNormalizeUriPath function. This
function correctly handles the normalization of URIs consisting of
normal segments as well as "." and ".." segments, but fails to handle
other segments that start with a '.' character.

A quick runthrough of the important parts of this function:

The function starts by splitting up the URI into segments (at forward
slashes) into an array. At the same time, it calculates the total
length of these segments.

The function then iterates through the resulting array in order to
perform an in-place normalization (both the input and output pointers
point to the same array):

* If a given segment does not start with a '.', it is simply copied from the
  current input pointer to the current output pointer. The for loop's
  increment code will then advance both the input and output pointers.

* Otherwise, if the segment is "." or "..", the input and output pointers are
  adjusted appropriately (taking into account the for loop's increment code)
  but (correctly) no segment is copied.

* Otherwise the segment starts with a '.' but is not "." nor ".."; in this
  case the function incorrectly does nothing and both the input and output
  pointers are simply advanced by the for loop's increment code. This
  effectively skips over a segment in the segment array without any
  modification by the function.

After this iteration has completed, a string buffer for the final
output is allocated. The size used for this allocation comes from the
previously-calculated total segment length, with the addition of space
for forward slashes to join the segments back together again and a
null terminator. The segments in the array up to the final output
pointer are joined together in this buffer with forward slashes
separating them.

There are two ways to exploit this incorrect handling of certain segments:

1) Heap overflow

The heap overflow exploitation lies in the possibility to create a
disconnect between the lengths of the segments left in the segment
array after the iteration has completed and the previously-calculated
total segment length. The previously-calculated length should, in
theory, be the worst-case (longest) final output string buffer size
required (when all segments are left and none are removed by the
normalization iteration). However, since we can force the iteration to
skip over certain segments in the array, it is possible to effectively
duplicate segments in the resulting array; this is done by having the
segment copied from one location to another but then also having the
original copy skipped over, making it appear in the resulting array
twice. When this is done, the previously-calculated length is no
longer long enough for the final output's string buffer, and a heap
overflow occurs while joining together the final result.

As an example, take the following URI as input to the function:
"/./AAAAAAAA/.x".

The URI is first split into the segments "", ".", "AAAAAAAA" and ".",
with the total segment length calculated as 0 + 1 + 8 + 2 = 11 bytes.

The normalization iteration proceeds as follows:

* The "" segment is simply copied from input to output, and hence remains
  unchanged. Both the input and output pointers are then advanced.

* The "." segment causes the output pointer to stay in place while the input
  pointer advances forward.

* The "AAAAAAAA" segment is simply copied from input to output, and hence
  overwrites the previous "." segment. Both the input and output pointers are
  then advanced.

* Finally, the ".x" segment is incorrectly handled: no modification of
  segments is performed but both the input and output pointers are still
  advanced, moving the output pointer over the original "AAAAAAAA" segment.

Hence, the resulting segments in the array that are left up to the
final output pointer are "", "AAAAAAAA" and "AAAAAAAA". Note that the
"AAAAAAAA" segment has been duplicated. These segments, including
space for forward slashes to join them together with and a null
terminator, have a total length of 0 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 19 bytes.

A string buffer is then allocated for the final output, which uses the
previously-calculated total segment length of 11 bytes plus 3 bytes
for forward slashes and 1 byte for a null terminator, giving a total
size of 11 + 3 + 1 = 15 bytes.

The resulting segments are finally joined together into this final
output string buffer. In doing so in this case, however, the buffer is
overflowed by 19 - 15 = 4 bytes.

So, a remote attacker can make (ie.) a simple HTTP GET request for the
URI in question and cause a heap overflow. ASAN gives the following
output in this case, which shows the exact moment that the heap
overflow occurs:

(... snip ...)

As with all heap overflows, it's likely that this can then go on to be
exploited in order to gain full remote code execution, especially in
embedded systems which are less likely to have heap allocators with
modern hardening techniques.

2) Directory traversal

The directory traversal exploitation lies in the fact that we can
force the normalization iteration to skip over certain segments in the
array; namely, we can force it to skip over a ".." segment. The ".."
segment will pass through unchanged into the final output string
buffer, where it is treated by the rest of the server as an actual
parent-directory relative segment.

As an example, take the following URI as input to the function:
"/../../../../../.x/.x/.x/.x/.x/.x/etc/passwd".

The URI is first split into the segments "", "..", "..", "..", "..",
"..", ".x", ".x", ".x", ".x", ".x", ".x", "etc", and "passwd". (The
total segment length that is calculated during this operation is
irrelevant for this mode of exploitation.)

When the normalization iteration reaches the ".x" segments, the
contents of the segment array are still untouched (as all the previous
segments are either empty or are "..") and the output pointer is still
pointing back at the "" segment. The incorrect handling of the ".x"
segments only causes the output (and input) pointers to be advanced
forward over the "" and ".." segments.

When the iteration reaches the "etc" segment, all the "" and ".."
segments have been skipped over; the output pointer is now pointing at
the first ".x" segment. The "etc" is copied over the first ".x"
segment, and the "passwd" segment is copied over the second ".x"
segment.

Hence, the resulting segments in the array that are left up to the
final output pointer are "", "..", "..", "..", "..", "..", "etc" and
"passwd"; note that the ".." segments are still present.

The final output string buffer is created and the resulting segments
are joined together to give a string of "/../../../../../etc/passwd".

The rest of the server is expecting that the result from the function
is normalized and that it contains no relative segments. Hence, the
".." segments go unnoticed when opening the content file while
handling the HTTP request. The end result is that the local filesystem
is traversed up from the administrator-configured web root until
reaching the filesystem's root directory and back down again into the
"/etc/passwd" file. Hence, the file "/etc/passwd" is given in response
to the HTTP request, regardless of the configured web root.

So, a remote attacker can make (ie.) a simple HTTP GET request for the
URI in question and get the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file:

$ echo -ne 'GET /../../../../../.x/.x/.x/.x/.x/.x/etc/passwd
HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n' | nc localhost 4700
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: GoAhead-http
Date: Sun Nov 16 17:21:01 2014
Content-Length: 1346
Connection: close
Last-Modified: Sat Oct 25 17:07:25 2014

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin
(... snip ...)

Of course, 5 ".." segments may not be enough to reach the filesystem's
root directory in all cases and so the crafted URI may have to be
extended with more ".." and ".x" segments.

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
