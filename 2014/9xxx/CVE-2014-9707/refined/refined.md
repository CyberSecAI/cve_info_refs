{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-9707",
  "description": "The GoAhead Web Server versions 3.0.0 to 3.4.1 incorrectly normalizes HTTP request URIs containing path segments that start with a \".\" but are not entirely equal to \".\" or \"..\" (e.g., \".x\"). This can lead to a heap overflow or directory traversal.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `websNormalizeUriPath` function in the GoAhead web server improperly handles URI path segments that begin with a dot (\".\") but are not equal to \".\" or \"..\".  It skips these segments during normalization, leading to discrepancies in the calculated buffer size and allowing for heap overflows or directory traversals.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect URI normalization",
      "Improper handling of \".\" prefixed path segments",
      "Inconsistent segment length calculation during normalization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a heap overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution, or perform a directory traversal attack to access arbitrary files on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending HTTP requests with crafted URIs containing \".\" prefixed path segments (e.g., \".x\")",
         "Exploiting the heap overflow to achieve remote code execution.",
         "Using directory traversal to access sensitive server files."
        ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No special privileges or pre-existing access is required."
