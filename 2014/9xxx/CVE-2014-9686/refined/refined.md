Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-9686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the way the Google Maps plugin for Joomla handles requests through its proxy functionality (`plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` and `plugin_googlemap3_kmlprxy.php`). Specifically, the plugin fails to properly validate the requested URL, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, which is then fetched by the server. This enables a form of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not adequately validate the `url` parameter, allowing arbitrary URLs to be passed to the proxy script.
*   **Bypassing Security Filter:** The plugin includes a domain restriction filter, which is intended to prevent SSRF attacks. However, this filter can be bypassed by using the vulnerable plugin on a site which shares the same domain as the target site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a large number of requests or requesting large files from the target via the vulnerable plugin, an attacker can cause a denial of service on the target website or the server hosting the vulnerable site.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin can be used as an open proxy, potentially enabling an attacker to make requests to internal services which are not directly accessible from the outside. This could have serious consequences such as information disclosure, or allowing the attacker to interact with internal services not intended for public access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a GET request to the proxy script with a manipulated `url` parameter:

    ```
    http://site/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php?url=site.wordpress.com
    http://site/plugins/system/plugin_googlemap3/plugin_googlemap3_kmlprxy.php?url=site.wordpress.com
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to a Site Using Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker must have access to a website using a vulnerable version of the Google Maps plugin for Joomla.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the target they wish to attack.
*   **Control of a Subdomain:** The attacker controls a subdomain of the target's domain.
*   **Bypass Security Filter:** The attacker must be able to bypass the domain restriction filter, typically by using a target site which is a subdomain of a site using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Google Maps plugin v3.2 for Joomla and previous versions, except for versions 2.19, 2.20, and 3.1 where the proxy functionality was removed.
*   The vulnerability is related to the earlier CVE-2013-7428 (also a DoS), but is specific to the case where an attacker controls a subdomain of the victim's domain.
*   The content mentions that the attacker can utilize DAVOSET to conduct automated DoS or DDoS attacks.

**Summary of CVE-2014-9686**
CVE-2014-9686 describes a specific scenario of a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability found in the Google Maps plugin for Joomla, where an attacker can exploit a domain validation bypass to cause a denial of service against a site that shares the same domain as the vulnerable plugin. This is achieved by manipulating the `url` parameter of the proxy scripts within the plugin.
