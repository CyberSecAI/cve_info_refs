Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the ProConOs and MultiProg applications. The protocol used by these applications does not have any authentication mechanism, meaning that there is no requirement for a user to prove they are authorized before interacting with the process control or making changes to the ladder logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of any form of authentication in the software's protocol. This allows any network user to send commands without verification.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The lack of authentication implies no access controls are enforced, enabling unauthorized access to critical functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Control:** An attacker can remotely interact with the process control.
- **Logic Modification:** An attacker can change the ladder logic of the industrial control system. This could lead to unexpected or harmful behavior in the physical process being controlled.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The impact assessment stated that there is a complete compromise for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has network access to the affected system. This includes internal network users, and potentially external users if the system is exposed.
- **Direct Command Injection:** Attackers can inject commands directly into the protocol due to the absence of authentication, giving full control of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the device on the network.
- **Low Skill Level:** Exploitation is considered to be of low difficulty, meaning that an attacker with limited skills could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Protocol Knowledge:** While not explicitly stated, some basic knowledge of the protocol would likely be required to craft and send commands.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected software was intentionally written without authentication mechanisms, with the expectation that vendors would implement their own authentication within their products. This creates a vulnerability for systems that do not implement such protections.
- The vendor is considering adding authentication in future versions but has not confirmed this is part of a security update.
- The provided exploit code shows a proof-of-concept using python to connect to the device and query/modify its state.
