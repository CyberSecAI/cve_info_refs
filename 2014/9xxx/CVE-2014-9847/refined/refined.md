Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-9847 and its neighboring CVEs:

**CVE-2014-9847**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of the "previous" image in the JNG decoder within ImageMagick.
*   **Weaknesses:** The JNG decoder in ImageMagick does not handle the "previous" image correctly. This implies a logic error or a flaw in how the decoder manages the image data.
*   **Impact:** The CVE description is rather vague ("unspecified impact"). However, the SUSE and other sources specify it may result in a denial of service (application crash).
*  **Attack Vectors**: crafted image file over network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted JNG image to the affected service. No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9845**

*   **Root Cause**: A crash due to a corrupted DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) file.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Vulnerability in how ImageMagick processes corrupted DIB files, leading to a crash during processing
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash) of ImageMagick
*   **Attack Vectors:** A crafted DIB file over a network.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities**: Attacker needs to be able to send a corrupted DIB image to the affected service. No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9844**

*   **Root Cause**: An out-of-bounds read in the ReadRLEImage function of ImageMagick when handling a crafted RLE (Run-Length Encoded) image file.
*   **Weaknesses:** ImageMagick's RLE decoder is susceptible to an out-of-bounds read due to flawed boundary checks or handling of a corrupted image.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service (out-of-bounds read/crash)
*   **Attack Vectors:** A crafted RLE image over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted RLE image to the affected service. No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9848**

*   **Root Cause**: Memory leak in ImageMagick.
*   **Weaknesses**:  Incorrect memory management, that could lead to excessive memory consumption.
*  **Impact**: Denial of service (memory exhaustion).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker sends an image processed by ImageMagick
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required.

**CVE-2015-8894**

*   **Root Cause**: Double free vulnerability in the TGA (Targa) image decoder within ImageMagick.
*   **Weaknesses:** A flawed logic in the TGA decoder where memory is freed twice, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact**: Application crash (denial of service) due to a double free.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted TGA file over a network.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities**: Attacker needs to be able to send a corrupted TGA image to the affected service. No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9850**

*   **Root Cause**: Logic error in ImageMagick related to resource limits.
*   **Weaknesses**: The error is specifically related to thread limits and could lead to excessive resource consumption.
*   **Impact**: Denial of Service (resource exhaustion).
*   **Attack Vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9851**

*  **Root Cause**: A crash occurs when parsing resource block within ImageMagick.
*   **Weaknesses:** A vulnerability within resource block parsing that leads to a crash.
*  **Impact**: Application crash (denial of service).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted file, likely over a network.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities**: No authentication is required.

**CVE-2014-9853**

*   **Root Cause**: A memory leak within ImageMagick's RLE (Run-Length Encoded) decoder.
*   **Weaknesses:** The decoder does not properly free memory leading to a leak.
*   **Impact**: Denial of Service (memory exhaustion).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted RLE file, likely over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes**

*   **Common Theme:** Most of these vulnerabilities revolve around ImageMagick's image decoders, which handle various image formats. Errors include buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, double frees, memory leaks, and improper error handling.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks are common, where a crafted image file is sent to an ImageMagick instance, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash/resource exhaustion) is a common impact across these vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Affected:** The reports identify ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick as the affected libraries. Various SUSE and openSUSE distributions are listed as affected. Several Ubuntu versions are also affected, as seen in the Ubuntu notice.
*  **Mitigation:** The recommended mitigation is to apply the provided security updates to resolve the vulnerabilities in the ImageMagick packages.
*   **SUSE Bugzilla:** Many of the SUSE reports refer to bugzilla entries, which are a centralized location for tracking and discussing these specific issues.
*   **Patch Information**: The SUSE content provides detailed package lists with fixed versions. This means that to fix the vulnerabilities, one needs to update the listed packages to their specific versions.
*  **Ubuntu Notice:** The Ubuntu notice references a large number of CVEs and multiple vulnerabilities fixed within a single update. It also highlights that the vulnerabilities allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
* **RedHat Bugzilla**: RedHat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2014-9847 indicates that this issue will be "CLOSED WONTFIX"

This analysis should provide a good understanding of the nature and scope of vulnerabilities described in the documents for CVE-2014-9847 and neighboring CVEs.
