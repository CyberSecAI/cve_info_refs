Subject: CVE Request: systemd / journald created world readable journal files

Hi,

systemd-journald from systemd v213 started creating world readable journals, allowing
local users to read sensitive system log entries.

While spotted by our users in
<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=972612>
the problem was present and fixed in upstream systemd git...

Introduced by this commit in v213:
<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/a606871da508995f5ede113a8fc6538afd98966c>

Fixed for volatile journals was done by this commit in v214:
<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/176f2acf8dee45fee832fd2ab07243f63783a238>

Fixed for the current persistent journal by this commit in v229:
<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/afae249efa4774c6676738ac5de6aeb4daf4889f>

Ciao, Marcus

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=964355#c0)  Mathias Homann   2016-01-31 13:21:26 UTC  ``` Since the latest udev update (udev-210.1453291613.c8d5bdf-25.30.1.x86_64, installed on 2016-01-29) that unit does not start anymore.  All I can see is the following error in my system journal:  Jan 31 12:45:55 cloud systemd[1]: Cannot add dependency job for unit systemd-udev-root-symlink.service, ignoring: Unit systemd-udev-root-symlink.service failed to load: Invalid argument. See system logs and 'systemctl status systemd-udev-root-symlink.service' for details.  but then, with journalctl or systemctl I don't see anything else besides that message.  On closer inspection I'm guessing that there is a syntax error in the unit file:  ExecStart=@udevlibexec@/rootsymlink-generator ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=964355#c1)  Martin Pluskal   2016-01-31 15:59:12 UTC  ``` Please do not adjust priorities. those are for release managers/people solving bugs - unless of course you want to work on this issue. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=964355#c2)  Franck Bui   2016-02-01 08:44:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mathias Homann from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=964355#c0)) >  > On closer inspection I'm guessing that there is a syntax error in the unit > file: >  > ExecStart=@udevlibexec@/rootsymlink-generator  sigh.... @udevlibexecdir@ should have been used.

faadb74 tmpfiles: don't allow read access to journal files to users not
in systemd-journal 9b1ef37 tmpfiles: don't apply sgid and executable bit
to journal files, only the directories they are contained in 011c39f
tmpfiles: add ability to mask access mode by pre-existing access mode on
files/directories 07e2d60 tmpfiles: get rid of "m" lines d504e28

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c0)  Andrei Borzenkov   2016-03-25 03:39:27 UTC  ``` On Leap archived journal files in /var/log/journal/$uuid are all world-readable - both system and user. The current journal (i.e. system.journal for system instance or user-$UID.journal for user) are correctly restricted to root/systemd-journal or owning user).  This allows any user to read anyone's archived journals by using explicit  journalctl --file=/path/to/archived/file  This problem does not exist on Tumbleweed where access to archived files are restricted in the same way as to current journal.  When user attempts to read journal without specifying filename, journalctl tries to open current journal first and errors out, which hides this issue.  On 13.2 it is worse - even current log in /run/log/journal is world-readable. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c1)  Per Jessen   2016-03-25 12:07:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrei Borzenkov from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c0)) > On Leap archived journal files in /var/log/journal/$uuid are all > world-readable - both system and user.

I think I mistook archives and current log when I reported that.

That's probaby due to:  # grep journal /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf  m /var/log/journal 2755 root systemd-journal - - Z /var/log/journal/%m 2755 root systemd-journal - - m /run/log/journal 2755 root systemd-journal - - Z /run/log/journal/%m 2755 root systemd-journal - -  And unfortunately this bug is due to a patch that has been backported quite some time ago now:  commit a606871da508995f5ede113a8fc6538afd98966c Author: Greg KH <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org> Date:   Tue Apr 15 14:12:01 2014 -0700      tmpfiles: fix permissions on new journal files          When starting up journald on a new system, set the proper permissions on     the system.journal files, not only on the journal directory.  I'll fix it.  Thanks for spotting. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c4)  Franck Bui   2016-03-30 07:55:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrei Borzenkov from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c0)) > On Leap archived journal files in /var/log/journal/$uuid are all > world-readable - both system and user. The current journal (i.e. > system.journal for system instance or user-$UID.journal for user) are > correctly restricted to root/systemd-journal or owning user).  The fact that system.journal get the right permissions is due to a race between systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service and systemd-journal-flush.service :-/  Normally systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service should run after systemd-journal-flush.service. Therefore flushing the journal should fix the permissions but tmpfiles-setup.service screws them afterwards.  However since systemd-journal-flush.service doesn't make sure that journald actually finishes to flush the journal (in v210) before exiting it happens that systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service runs before.  That's probably the main reason why journalctl gained the --flush option even though it's not obvious after reading commit message which introduced it.  --flush sends the SIGUSR1 signal to journald but also *waits* for the operation to complete.  Here running in debug mode makes system.journal having the wrong permissions. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c5)  Franck Bui   2016-03-30 10:26:39 UTC  ``` @Andrei, could you give this repo a test ?

I dont this has been fixed at all for those who run systemd with the above commit applies.  commit 176f2acf8dee45fee832fd2ab07243f63783a238 (v214) stops systemd from settting the world readable bit but leaves the already created journal files with this bit sets.  commit afae249efa4774c6676738ac5de6aeb4daf4889f (v229) makes sure that the world readable bit is removed but only for the current persistent journal (/var/log/journal/xxxx/system.journal. No changes for the archived journals.  For volatile journals, this was fixed by 176f2acf8dee45fee832fd2ab07243f63783a238 (v214). ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c15)  Marcus Meissner   2016-04-08 10:58:07 UTC  ``` i requested a CVE on oss-sec ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-11 08:21:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c15))  > Fixed for volatile journals was done by this commit in v214: > <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/176f2acf8dee45fee832fd2ab07243f63783a238>  Use CVE-2014-9770.  > Fixed for the current persistent journal by this commit in v229: > <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/afae249efa4774c6676738ac5de6aeb4daf4889f>  Use CVE-2015-8842. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c17)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-04-11 09:01:20 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (972612) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/387363> 13.1 / systemd <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/387366> 13.2 / systemd ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c18)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-04-11 11:00:54 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (972612) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/387417> 13.2 / systemd <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/387420> 13.1 / systemd ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=972612#c20)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-04-19 13:10:06 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1101-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c0)  Dieter Jurzitza   2015-12-23 11:08:04 UTC  ``` nfs-utils request gssproxy to be started. However, gssproxy is not part of the openSUSE distribution as yet. This causes systemd to write logging information several times a day:  Nov 16 23:08:01 djunix systemd[1]: Cannot add dependency job for unit gssproxy.service, ignoring: Unit gssproxy.service failed to load: No such file or directory.  the root cause for this can be found by a grep -R /etc/systemd /usr/lib/systemd:  /usr/lib/systemd/system/auth-rpcgss-module.service:Before=gssproxy.service rpc-svcgssd.service rpc-gssd.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/auth-rpcgss-module.service:Wants=gssproxy.service rpc-svcgssd.service rpc-gssd.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-client.target:After=rpc-gssd.service rpc-svcgssd.service gssproxy.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/rpc-svcgssd.service:After=gssproxy.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/rpc-svcgssd.service:ConditionPathExists=|!/run/gssproxy.pid /usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service:After=rpc-gssd.service gssproxy.service rpc-svcgssd.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nfs-server.service:After=rpc-gssd.service gssproxy.service rpc-svcgssd.service  I solved this in the meantime by installing gssproxy to fulfill the dependency, see 956558, I initially thought that the ticket was related, however, the ticket owner suggested to open a separate ticket here. Most of the related services stem from nfs-client ...  I provided a spec-file for gssproxy (see 956558) however, the question is how to solve this in case gssproxy should not be provided now.  Please see [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c11) in 956558, I opened a new bug report because this was suggested by the bug owner of 956558.  Thank you for looking into this, take care     Dieter Jurzitza ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c1)  Dr. Werner Fink   2016-01-11 14:59:29 UTC  ``` Question: Why is this missing/broken installation and/or dependency a bug of systemd? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c2)  Neil Brown   2016-01-13 01:03:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dr. Werner Fink from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c1)) > Question: Why is this missing/broken installation and/or dependency a bug of > systemd?  Because there is nothing "broken" about the installation or dependencies.  There is a *optional* dependencies ("wants") which isn't installed. The problem is that systemd is inappropriately noisy about optional dependencies that aren't met. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c3)  Dr. Werner Fink   2016-01-13 07:46:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil Brown from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c2))  `Wants' is not optional. The usage of `Wants' and `Requires' do both require the dependencies, the difference is described in the man:systemd.unit(5)         Wants=            A weaker version of Requires=. Units listed in this option will be            started if the configuring unit is. However, if the listed            units fail to start or cannot be added to the transaction, this has              no impact on the validity of the transaction as a whole.            This is the recommended way to hook start-up of one unit to the            start-up of another unit.             Note that dependencies of this type may also be configured outside            of the unit configuration file by adding symlinks to a            .wants/ directory accompanying the unit file.  Pure optional are the tags Before= and After= if not combined with Requires=, RequiresOverridable=, Requisite=, RequisiteOverridable=, Wants=, BindsTo=, or PartOf=. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c4)  Dr. Werner Fink   2016-01-13 07:58:42 UTC  ``` Please remove the Wants= for gssproxy.service or add a package dependency to install the unit gssproxy.service ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c5)  Thomas Blume   2016-01-13 08:02:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dr. Werner Fink from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c4)) > Please remove the Wants= for gssproxy.service or add a package dependency to > install the unit gssproxy.service  What about using WantedBy in gssproxy.service, instead of Wants in auth-rpcgss-module.service? Wouldn't this make the warnings go away? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c6)  Dr. Werner Fink   2016-01-13 08:07:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Blume from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c5))  Yes this would, but I do not find the package which provides gssproxy.service ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c7)  Thomas Blume   2016-01-13 08:46:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dr. Werner Fink from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c6)) > (In reply to Thomas Blume from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c5)) >  > Yes this would, but I do not find the package which provides gssproxy.service  gssproxy.service seems to be not available in OpenSUSE (see [bug 956558 comment#7](show_bug.cgi?id=956558#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Base:System/nfs-utils: Bug GSS is disabled in config, but see rpc-svcgssd.service ERROR ( GSS-API: error in gss_acquire_cred(): GSS_S_FAILURE) on boot")). So the for OpenSUSE we might just remove the wants and add the WantedBy for SLES. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c8)  Dieter Jurzitza   2016-01-13 10:38:51 UTC  ``` FYI: I added the SPEC-file for gss-proxy as an atachement to #956558. I am starting gssproxyd on leap 42.1 - without actually knowing whether it works or not - at least it seems to do no harm. I could provide the entire src-rpm on request. Take care    Dieter Jurzitza ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c9)  Franck Bui   2016-01-13 15:24:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil Brown from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c2)) > (In reply to Dr. Werner Fink from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c1)) > > Question: Why is this missing/broken installation and/or dependency a bug of > > systemd? >  > Because there is nothing "broken" about the installation or dependencies.  > There is a *optional* dependencies ("wants") which isn't installed. > The problem is that systemd is inappropriately noisy about optional > dependencies that aren't met.

This PR was more a RFC and was sent in order to get some feedback but I was surprise to see that it was accepted quickly without any discussions.  Here it is: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/2322>  So we probably can do the same now.  @Dieter, you wrote in your initial report:  > This causes systemd to write logging information several times a day:  I'm not sure to understand why the log is written *several times* a day since you need to restart the service that wants gssproxy for the log to be written. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c13)  Dieter Jurzitza   2016-01-18 18:53:39 UTC  ``` Hi Franck, please take a look at the attachement "loginfo". You will find that systemd is filling the logs about every 10 minutes with the same message. I guess systemd somehow keeps in mind that the service is not running but ought to do so.  What regards lowering the loglevel, this appears to me like compiling programs and intentionally remove the -Wall flag ... the service is missing, so systemd moans about it - and it is up to the system builder to fix this, either by modifying the systemd - service files or by simply adding gssproxy to the distribution (this is what I did, as fedora readily distributes it).  Prior to asking for reducing the loglevel it would be much more helpful to allow systemd to assign environment variables from within a service file, *this* would be a real benefit IMHO ....  Thank you for looking into this, take care      Dieter Jurzitza ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=960158#c14)  Dieter Jurzitza   2016-01-18 18:54:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 662148](attachment.cgi?id=662148 "excerpt from /var/log/messages ...")

If the optional dependency isn't installed at all, this is not seen by systemd as an error and it's up to the service to log it accordingly.
