The provided content relates to CVE-2014-9596.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Panasonic Arbitrator Back-End Server (BES) uses an unencrypted communication channel for transmitting data between the client and the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- Exposure of Active Directory and other sensitive credentials due to the lack of encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user on the network can intercept the unencrypted communication and discover sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks where the attacker is positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Panasonic Arbitrator system.
- Interception of unencrypted data transmitted between the client and server

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Panasonic Arbitrator system, enabling them to eavesdrop on the unencrypted communication.
- No specific user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be in a position to capture network traffic.
