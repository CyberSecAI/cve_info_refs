Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9731:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content from `lists.opensuse.org` and `www.suse.com` explicitly mention CVE-2014-9731 in relation to updates for the Linux kernel, specifically concerning UDF filesystem handling. The CVE description at `www.suse.com` also matches, indicating this is related to a vulnerability in handling symlink path lengths in the UDF filesystem and the ability of local users to cause an information disclosure by crafting a malicious filesystem image. 
   - The information available matches the official description which refers to: "The UDF filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not ensure that space is available for storing a symlink target's name along with a trailing \0 character, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via a crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/symlink.c and fs/udf/unicode.c."
    - The git commit log from `git.kernel.org` also references a patch fixing path length handling issues in udf symlinks
    -Therefore, the provided information is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2014-9731.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling symlink path lengths in the UDF filesystem code within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `udf_pc_to_char` function in `fs/udf/symlink.c` did not ensure that sufficient space was available in the destination buffer when copying the symlink target's name, including a null terminator.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Bounds Checking**: The code failed to validate the available buffer space before writing the symlink name, leading to a potential buffer over-read during the path construction within the kernel.
    *  **Information Leakage**: The vulnerability can lead to an information leak because the code doesn't validate sizes when copying names and paths while creating symlinks
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive kernel memory contents by creating a specially crafted UDF filesystem image that exploits the lack of bounds checking when fetching the target of a symlink.
    *   **Denial of Service:** In addition to information disclosure, the buffer over-read could also cause a denial-of-service (system crash).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** A local attacker with the ability to mount filesystems, specifically a maliciously crafted UDF filesystem image, could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to mount and interact with filesystems.
    *   **Malicious Filesystem Image:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a specially crafted UDF filesystem image.

**3. Additional Technical Details**

* The fix is present in the Linux kernel since version 3.18.2
*   The vulnerability lies in the `fs/udf/symlink.c` and `fs/udf/unicode.c` files.
*   The commit message from kernel.org confirms the issue was due to missing checks and size validations during symlink handling, with specific mention of length checks and a missing null terminator.

**4. Content Providing More Detail than CVE Description**
   - The SUSE advisory on `www.suse.com` provides a more detailed description of the bug, how to trigger it (local attacker with the ability to mount a crafted filesystem) and the affected files (`fs/udf/inode.c` and `fs/udf/symlink.c`). It also includes CVSSv2 scores.
   - The commit log from kernel.org shows the patch that fixes the vulnerability, clarifying that the main issue was with the lack of bounds check when copying the symlink path

**5. Summary of Fix**
  - The fix implemented a check in the `udf_pc_to_char` function of `fs/udf/symlink.c` to ensure that there is enough space in the buffer before copying data. This prevents over-reads and memory corruption due to incorrect length handling.
