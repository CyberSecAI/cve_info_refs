Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in VDG Security SENSE (formerly DIVA), as described in the security advisory:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthenticated local file disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in the proprietary web server implementation.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from the filesystem with "SYSTEM" privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive information like configuration files containing clear text passwords or password hashes can be accessed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable webserver.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication required; the attacker needs to send a specific HTTP request.

2.  **Authentication bypass / Clear text password disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper authentication handling in some parts of the application.
    *   **Weakness:** Authentication can be bypassed by sending an HTTP Authorization header with a colon ":".
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to update DIVA plugin configuration and read plugin configurations containing clear text administrator credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending an HTTP GET or POST request with the specific "Authorization: Basic Og==" header.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication needed to bypass authentication.

3.  **Insecure service configuration / Hardcoded default credentials - Postgres:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The PostgreSQL database is accessible over the network with hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Weakness:** PostgreSQL database available on TCP port 5432 with hardcoded username "root" and password "ArpaRomaWi".
    *   **Impact:** Remote attackers can gain access to the database and potentially escalate privileges.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Connecting to the PostgreSQL server via network.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable service.

4.  **Hardcoded default credentials - Windows Users:**
    *   **Root Cause:** During DIVA setup, local Windows users are created with hardcoded passwords.
    *   **Weakness:** Multiple local Windows users (postgres, NTP) are created with the password "!DVService".
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can log on to the server with these credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local login to the server with the vulnerable account.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the local Windows system.

5.  **Critical information disclosure / User database leakage:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The server sends the user database to the client after authentication regardless of the user's rights.
    *   **Weakness:** The server discloses the user database containing user and password hashes through the proprietary protocol on TCP port 51410.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain user credentials, which can be used to login as another user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting or observing the traffic on the proprietary protocol port (51410) after authentication.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the proprietary protocol or the ability to intercept traffic, and can authenticate with any user credentials.

6.  **Use of plain text protocols:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Communication channels lack encryption.
    *   **Weakness:** All DIVA communication channels (TCP ports 80, 51410, etc.) use plain text protocols.
    *  **Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted over the network can be intercepted and viewed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Traffic interception.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to passively monitor network traffic.

7.  **Buffer overflow vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the DIVA web service API when processing "AuthenticateUser" requests.
    *   **Weakness:** The "user" and "password" parameters in the `/webservice` API are vulnerable to buffer overflows.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted "AuthenticateUser" request to the vulnerable web service API.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the vendor did not respond to emails, making it difficult to know exactly which vulnerabilities were fixed in later versions.
*   The advisory states that the DIVA modules are not ASLR-enabled, making exploitation easier.
*   The password hashing scheme was reverse engineered, and both hashes can be used for authentication, eliminating the need for brute force attacks against password hashes.
