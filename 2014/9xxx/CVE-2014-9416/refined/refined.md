    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "DLL hijacking vulnerability",
        "weaknesses": "The application loads DLLs from an untrusted location. The application attempts to load mfc71enu.dll, mfc71loc.dll, tcapi.dll, and airpcap.dll.  By placing a malicious DLL with the same name in a location where the application searches for DLLs, an attacker can cause the application to load the attacker's DLL rather than the legitimate DLL.",
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, potentially leading to a compromise of the system.",
        "attack_vectors": "Local. Attacker needs to place a malicious DLL with the same name as the target DLL in a directory that is searched by the application.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have write access to a directory where the application searches for DLLs, and be able to place the malicious DLL there."
