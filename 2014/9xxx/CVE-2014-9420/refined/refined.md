Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `rock_continue` function within the Linux kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system (specifically, in `fs/isofs/rock.c`). This function does not properly limit the number of Rock Ridge continuation entries that can be processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:**  The core weakness is the lack of a check or limit on the number of Rock Ridge continuation entries. A crafted ISO9660 image can include a sequence of these continuation entries which form a loop, causing the `rock_continue` function to enter an infinite loop.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The function fails to validate the number or structure of continuation entries within the ISO 9660 image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can cause a denial of service through a system crash, hang or making it unresponsive. This is due to the infinite loop causing high resource consumption.
*   **System Crash/Hang:** The infinite loop can lead to a complete system crash or an unkillable system hang

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to mount a crafted ISO9660 image on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **ISO 9660 Image Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted ISO 9660 image with looping or excessively long continuation entries.
*   **Mount Privilege** The attacker must have the capability to mount an arbitrary image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to 3.18.2.
*   The fix involves limiting the number of Rock Ridge continuation entries that the `rock_continue` function will process, thereby preventing the infinite loop.

The information from different sources consistently points to the same core vulnerability and its effects, differing slightly in the description and how it is presented.
