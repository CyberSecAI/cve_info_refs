How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# AST-2014-019: Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server

---

*From*: "Asterisk Security Team" <security () asterisk org>

*Date*: Wed, 10 Dec 2014 12:29:42 -0600

---

```
               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2014-019

         Product        Asterisk
         Summary        Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server
    Nature of Advisory  Denial of Service
      Susceptibility    Remote Unauthenticated Sessions
         Severity       Moderate
      Exploits Known    No
       Reported On      30 October 2014
       Reported By      Badalian Vyacheslav
        Posted On       10 December 2014
     Last Updated On    December 10, 2014
     Advisory Contact   Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com>
         CVE Name

    Description  When handling a WebSocket frame the res_http_websocket
                 module dynamically changes the size of the memory used to
                 allow the provided payload to fit. If a payload length of
                 zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt to
                 resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end up
                 freeing the memory but be treated as a failure. When the
                 session was subsequently torn down this memory would get
                 freed yet again causing a crash.

                 Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take into
                 account that provided text frames are not guaranteed to be
                 NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan_sip and
                 chan_pjsip in the applicable versions.

    Resolution  Ensure the built-in HTTP server is disabled, upgrade to a
                version listed below, or apply the applicable patch.

                The change ensures that res_http_websocket does not treat
                the freeing of memory when a payload length of zero is
                received as fatal.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2014-019

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Remote Crash Vulnerability in WebSocket Server |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Denial of Service |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Moderate |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | 30 October 2014 |
| **Reported By** | Badalian Vyacheslav |
| **Posted On** | 10 December 2014 |
| **Last Updated On** | December 22, 2014 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-9374 |

| **Description** | When handling a WebSocket frame the res\_http\_websocket module dynamically changes the size of the memory used to allow the provided payload to fit. If a payload length of zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt to resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end up freeing the memory but be treated as a failure. When the session was subsequently torn down this memory would get freed yet again causing a crash.    Users of the WebSocket functionality also did not take into account that provided text frames are not guaranteed to be NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan\_sip and chan\_pjsip in the applicable versions. |

| **Resolution** | Ensure the built-in HTTP server is disabled, upgrade to a version listed below, or apply the applicable patch.    The change ensures that res\_http\_websocket does not treat the freeing of memory when a payload length of zero is received as fatal. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Certified Asterisk | 11.6 | All versions |

| **Product** | **Release** |
| Certified Asterisk | 11.6-cert9 |
| Asterisk Open Source | 11.14.2, 12.7.2, 13.0.2 |
