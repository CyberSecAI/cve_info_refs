Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9367:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of URL parameters within the `WebSearch` topic of TWiki. Specifically, the `urlEncode` function in `lib/TWiki.pm` does not properly encode single quotes, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, enabled by the lack of proper encoding of single quotes within URL parameters.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: TWiki does not adequately sanitize user-supplied URL parameters, particularly the `scope` parameter in the `WebSearch` topic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Content/Browser Compromise: This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including session hijacking, phishing, and defacement of the TWiki site, as the javascript will execute in the context of the TWiki domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Requests: The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the TWiki server targeting the `WebSearch` topic.
- Malicious URL Parameters: Attackers insert malicious JavaScript code into the `scope` or other vulnerable URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with specific parameters.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability; an attacker can simply send the malicious link to a user or have them visit a page with this link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in how TWiki handles URL encoding, specifically in the `urlEncode` subroutine of `lib/TWiki.pm`.
- The problematic regular expression, originally `$text =~ s/([^0-9a-zA-Z-_.:~!*'\/])/'%'.sprintf('%02x',ord($1))/ge;`, incorrectly includes the single quote which should be encoded.
- A crafted URL like `GET /do/view/TWiki/WebSearch?search=Search&scope='"--></style></script><script>alert('CVE-2014-9367 vulnarable!')</script>` can trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- The patch modifies the regular expression in `urlEncode` to `$text =~ s/([^0-9a-zA-Z-_.:~!*\/])/'%'.sprintf('%02x',ord($1))/ge;`, removing the single quote from the set of characters to be escaped which will then encode it.
- Applying a patch to `lib/TWiki.pm` by removing the single quote (') from the regular expression set in sub urlEncode.
- Updating the TWiki system topics `TWiki.SearchResultsPagination`, `TWiki.WebSearch`, and `TWiki.WebSearchAdvanced` with patched versions.
