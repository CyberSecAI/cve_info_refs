- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm kernel due to a flaw in the handling of certain operations within the kernel's memory management or device drivers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The specific weakness is not detailed within the provided text, it is stated as an "elevation of privilege vulnerability". It appears to involve a kernel driver issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel, leading to a local permanent device compromise. This may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A local malicious application is the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the device.
