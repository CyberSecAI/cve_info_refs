## NTP Project Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) contains multiple vulnerabilities (Updated)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#852879

Original Release Date: 2014-12-19 | Last Revised: 2015-10-27

---

### Overview

The NTP Project ntpd version 4.2.7 and pervious versions contain several vulnerabilities. ntp-keygen prior to version 4.2.7p230 also uses a non-cryptographic random number generator when generating symmetric keys. These vulnerabilities may affect ntpd acting as a server or client.

### Description

| The Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides networked systems and devices with a way to synchronize time for various services and applications. The reference implementation produced by the NTP Project (ntp.org) contains several vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html): **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2014-9298The IPv6 address ::1 can be spoofed, allowing an attacker to bypass ACLs based on ::1.[**CWE-754**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)**: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions -** CVE-2014-9297The length value in extension field pointers is not properly validated, allowing information leaks.[**CWE-332**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/332.html)**: Insufficient Entropy in PRNG -** CVE-2014-9293If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a cryptographically-weak default key is generated.[**CWE-338**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)**: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) -** CVE-2014-9294ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys.[**CWE-121**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**: Stack Buffer Overflow -** CVE-2014-9295A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto\_recv() (when using autokey authentication), ctl\_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed with the privilege of the ntpd process.[**CWE-389**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/389.html)**: Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes -** CVE-2014-9296A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered. This situation may be exploitable by an attacker.The NTP Project provides more information about these issues in their [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice).The NTP Project implementation is widely used in operating system distributions and network products. These vulnerabilities affect ntpd acting as a server or client. CERT/CC is not aware of any public exploit of these vulnerabilities at this time.The CVSS score below is based on the buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-9295). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ntpd may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary malicious code with the privilege level of the ntpd process. The weak default key and non-cryptographic random number generator in ntp-keygen may allow an attacker to gain information regarding the integrity checking and authentication encryption schemes. More specifically, the weak default key allows access to private mode and control mode queries that require authentication, if not restricted by the configuration. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues have been addressed in ntp-4.2.8p1. The update may be downloaded from [ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Restrict status queries**As noted in the [announcement](http://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2014-December/000122.html) for ntp-4.2.8:The vulnerabilities listed below can be significantly mitigated by following the BCP of putting restrict default ... [noquery](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions#Section_6.5.2)in the ntp.conf file.  With the exception of:   receive(): missing return on error   References: Sec 2670 / CVE-2014-9296 / VU#852879below (which is a limited-risk vulnerability), none of the recent vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited if the source IP is restricted from sending a 'query'-class packet by your ntp.conf file.**Use firewall rules**Install firewall rules that block ::1 IPv6 address from inappropriate network interfaces.**Disable autokey authentication**Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

"Our XTM and Firebox appliances (our main products) are not vulnerable to these flaws, since we use openntpd rather than ntpd.

Our wireless access points are not vulnerable since they only use the basic ntpclient.

However, our XCS appliances (mail security) are vulnerable to the ntpd flaws. We will be releasing a firmware update to fix these flaws as soon as practical. However, in the meantime, we are sharing simple steps to mitigate this issue (use out firewall to block NTP, and point to an internal, updated NTP server instead)."

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 09:05:47 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory, multiple buffer overflows were reported in ntp daemon, details provided below  * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv()  When Autokey Authentication is enabled (i.e. the ntp.conf file contains a 'crypto pw ...' directive) a remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   Mitigation:  Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file.  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata()  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   * Buffer overflow in configure()  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious	code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:20:17 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2667>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acc4dN1TbM1tRJrbPcA4yc1aTdA>  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2668>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acdf3tUSFizXcv_X4b77Jt_Y-cg>  * Buffer overflow in configure()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2669>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acf55dxKfhb6MuYQwzu8eDlS97g>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c10)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 14:55:36 UTC  ``` There are three issues described by [CVE-2014-9295](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9295).   * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv() This is an issue when Autokey Authentication is enabled, which it is not by default. As this is a non default setting we rate this issue as having Important impact.  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata() This issue is a problem if you allow control messages from untrusted hosts. By default these messages are allowed from localhost only. As this is a non default setting we rate this issue as having Important impact.  * Buffer overflow in configure() Our analysis has shown this issue would be a denial of service and not allow remote code execution. The overflow is a single null byte in the data segment and will overwrite part of a local file descriptor variable, which will not result in code execution. As this is a denial of service we rate this issue as having Important impact.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 16:21:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1176191](show_bug.cgi?id=1176191 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9296 CVE-2014-9294 CVE-2014-9295 CVE-2014-9293 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c15)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-19 20:50:45 UTC  ``` Also note that the privileges yielded by the ntp user are quite limited (ntpd only has the net_bind_service and sys_time capabilities).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-12-20 00:44:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:2025 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-2025.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-12-20 02:40:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:2024 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-2024.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c18)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-20 02:51:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c19)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-22 02:37:34 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-19.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * On December 19, 2014, NTP.org and US-CERT released security advisories for *ntpd* detailing two issues regarding weak cryptographic pseudorandom number generation (PRNG), three buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and an unhandled error condition with an unknown impact. Further, on February 4, 2015, these advisories were updated to include an autokey authentication vulnerability and an IPv6 ACL bypass vulnerability.      The impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product.      For Cisco products, refer to the information provided in the Cisco bug IDs listed in the "Affected Products" section of this document.       Additional information and detailed instructions are available in the Cisco installation, configuration, and maintenance guides for each product. If additional clarification or advice is needed, please contact your support organization.      The vulnerability names and associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs are as follows:   + Weak Default Key in config\_auth()    An issue in the generation of a random key for *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to guess the generated key. The attacker may be able to use it to send *ntpdc* query or configuration requests.         The issue occurs because *ntpd* automatically generates weak keys if no *ntpdc* request authentication key was specified in the *ntp.conf* configuration file. An attacker could exploit this issue by guessing the generated key and matching any configured IP restrictions. An exploit could allow the attacker to send *ntpdc* query or configuration requests.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9293.      The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) considers this a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability. + Noncryptographic Random Number Generator with Weak Seed Used by ntp-keygen to Generate Symmetric Keys    An issue in *ntp-keygen* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to guess the generated MD5 keys.         The issue occurs because *ntp-keygen* uses a weak method for generating the MD5 keys. An attacker could exploit this issue by guessing the generated MD5 keys. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the guessed MD5 keys to spoof a trusted NTP client or server.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9294.      Cisco PSIRT considers this a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability. + Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in ntpd    Vulnerabilities in *crypto\_recv(), ctl\_putdata(),* and *configure()* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a stack buffer overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute malicious code with the privilege level of the *ntpd* process.         The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect validation checks on the received packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted request packets. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the *ntpd* process. Arbitrary code execution with the privilege level of the *ntpd* process may also be possible.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9295. + ntpd receive(): Missing Return on Error    An issue in *ntp\_proto.c:receive()* of *ntp* in the code path where an error was detected could indicate processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurs.      The issue is due to a missing *return;* in the code path where an error was detected. It has not been proven how an attacker could exploit this issue. The impact to the affected system is also unknown.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9296.      Cisco PSIRT at this stage does not consider this to be a vulnerability. + NTP ntp\_crypto.c Improper Validation Vulnerability    A vulnerability in *ntp\_crypto.c* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of *vallen*. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to a device running *ntpd* and configured with autokey authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9297. + NTP IPv6 ACL Bypass Vulnerability    A vulnerability in IPv6 address handling could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to send IPv6 network packets to a vulnerable system using a spoofed source address of **::1** on an interface not configured for localhost.      The vulnerability is due to improper IPv6 address processing. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending IPv6 packets with a source address of **::1** to an affected host. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass application ACLs that rely on IPv6 source address filtering.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9298  Workarounds  * Mitigations involve preventing the device from processing NTP control queries. In products that allow for editing the ntp.conf file, this is accomplished by the **restrict** directive. Other products may support **ntp access-group** commands which can be used to filter NTP control queries. Potential workarounds for each affected Cisco product is referenced in the Cisco Bug ID workarounds section.      Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=36857>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       This section will be populated when investigation of each product has concluded.

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto\_recv(),
ctl\_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use
either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the ntp user. Note: the crypto\_recv() flaw requires non-default
configurations to be active, while the ctl\_putdata() flaw, by default, can
only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires
additional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)

It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal
use if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf
configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP
restrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send
ntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)

It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.
This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that
could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is
recommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated
with ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain such keys).
(CVE-2014-9294)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-03 00:19:41 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #2655](show_bug.cgi?id=2655 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple vulnerabilities in ntpd") +++  2) non-cryptographic random number generator with weak seed  * util/ntp-keygen.c:724 <gen_md5> (weak symmetric keys)  fix: use OS provided random numbers for crypto ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-03 01:01:13 UTC  ``` ntp_random.c was added during a time when a *lot* of OSes had significantly worse random number generators.  It looks like the "worst" use of ntp_random.c is when we need more than 31 bits of data and we use the entire result from ntp_random() for this.  While we do need to use a better seed with ntp_srandom(), it looks like the current code is OK if we use the low-order 8 or 16 bits.  I'm currently planning to use the arc4random() routines if available, and completely fill the seed buffer. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c2)  Danny Mayer    2014-11-03 05:06:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c1)) > I'm currently planning to use the arc4random() routines if available, and > completely fill the seed buffer.  There is a portable version of arc4random() from OpenBSD which looks like it is free for any reuse. You can find it here: <https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/master/arc4random.c> but of course someone needs to review it to make sure it's not considered weak and can be reused in this case. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c3)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-03 06:20:59 UTC  ``` Thanks, Danny! ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-05 05:51:39 UTC  ``` This bug has already been fixed in ntp-dev. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-23 00:07:32 UTC  ``` Specifically, the seed was made significantly better in 4.2.7p230, on 1 Nov 2011. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c6)  Stephen Röttger    2014-11-25 14:09:05 UTC  ``` The state used for generating MD5 keys is still 32 bit, which is way to short for cryptographic keys. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c7)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-26 11:03:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1163](attachment.cgi?id=1163&action=diff "Patch to use arc4random()") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1163&action=edit "Patch to use arc4random()") Patch to use arc4random()  Stephen, what do you think of my proposed patch? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c8)  Stephen Röttger    2014-11-28 09:10:49 UTC  ``` I'm not familiar with arc4random, is it available on all supported platforms? I read (sorry, can't find the link atm) that freebsd switched to a chacha implementation since RC4 has weaknesses but that the Linux implementation (in some library) didn't follow. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c9)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-28 10:23:25 UTC  ``` arc4random() should be available, and if it's not I'll build a copy from the copy Danny mentions in [comment#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c2).  If you have recommendations for something better I'm happy to give that a shot.  When I dug in to this it was my understanding that arc4andom() was much better suited for use where cryptographic-quality random numbers were needed.  For *ix boxes I could do something with /dev/urandom if that would be better, and somebody could write something for Windows that used CryptGenRandom (or similar, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379942(v=vs.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379942%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)).  I'm not sure what we'd do about other OSes.  Plan B would be to use OpenSSL's RAND_bytes(), which means we'd need to require OpenSSL.  This might be reasonable for cases where we will be linked with OpenSSL. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c10)  Danny Mayer    2014-12-01 16:17:19 UTC  ``` I implemented the Windows CryptGenRandom code in BIND9 in the lib/isc/win32/entropy.c file. It shouldn't be too hard to do the same thing here. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-04 09:34:08 UTC  ``` Stephen,  My current thought is that the ntp codebase use wrappers for accessing random number stuff, and we use:  - OpenSSL's RAND_*() routines if they are available, otherwise - arc4random(3), otherwise - our local implementation of arc4random(3), noting <https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2013-October/054018.html>  There are still potential problems with some of the above choices.  How far should we really go here, knowing that this is likely going to be a never-ending quest?  What do you recommend? ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c12)  Stephen Röttger    2014-12-04 10:18:15 UTC  ``` what would the local implementation of arc4random look like? ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c13)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-12 10:49:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c12)) > what would the local implementation of arc4random look like?  sntp/libevent/arc4random.c  and I haven't recently looked to see if there is a newer version of that file available. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c14)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-14 16:15:06 UTC  ``` I've implemented [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c11) and am testing it now. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2666#c15)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-20 05:59:39 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.2.8. ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto\_recv(),
ctl\_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use
either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the ntp user. Note: the crypto\_recv() flaw requires non-default
configurations to be active, while the ctl\_putdata() flaw, by default, can
only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires
additional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)

It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal
use if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf
configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP
restrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send
ntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)

It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.
This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that
could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is
recommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated
with ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain such keys.
(CVE-2014-9294)

A missing return statement in the receive() function could potentially
allow a remote attacker to bypass NTP's authentication mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9296)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 09:16:00 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  Code in ntp_proto.c:receive() was missing a 'return;' in the code path where an error was detected, which meant processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurred. We haven't found a way for this bug to affect system integrity. If there is no way to affect system integrity the base CVSS score for this bug is 0. If there is one avenue through which system integrity can be partially affected, the base score becomes a 5. If system integrity can be partially affected via all three integrity metrics, the CVSS base score become 7.5.  This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.    Mitigation:  Remove or comment out all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:23:12 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2670>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548ad06feXHK1HlZoY-WZVyynwvwAg>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c5)  Huzaifa S.

## Security Advisory 0008 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1047-security-advisory-8?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** January 9th 2015

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | January 9th 2015 | Initial release |

**Arista 7000 Series Products and Arista EOS are not vulnerable to NTP CVE-2014-9293, CVE-2014-9294, CVE-2014-9295, and CVE-2014-9296.**

In December 2014, the Network Time Foundation issued a series of security advisories detailing vulnerabilities in ntpd, their network time synchronization daemon. EOS uses this daemon for time synchronization, and a number of customers have contacted Arista Networks to ask whether their switches are affected. EOS is not exposed to these vulnerabilities, provided that users configure NTP through Arista's CLI rather than directly configuring ntpd, and that they do not use the ntp-keygen program to generate MD5 authentication keys.

CVE-2014-9293 (Weak default key in config\_auth()): Not vulnerable.

CVE-2014-9294 (Non-cryptographic random number generator with weak seed used by ntp-keygen to generate symmetric keys): Not vulnerable unless configured to use MD5 authentication for NTP and the MD5 key is generated manually with the ntp-keygen program. Arista EOS does not provide any mechanism for generating the key for NTP authentication. The ntp-key program can only be executed from the bash shell. If a user has generated a key using ntp-keygen from the bash shell the resulting key would be weak in MD5 authentication.

CVE-2014-9295 (Buffer overflows in crypto\_recv(), ctl\_putdata(), and configure()): Not vulnerable.

CVE-2014-9296 (Missing return on error in receive()): Not vulnerable.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

## Updated ntp packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 20 Dec 2014

Modification date: 20 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-9293](CVE-2014-9293.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9294](CVE-2014-9294.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9295](CVE-2014-9295.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9296](CVE-2014-9296.html)

## Description

```
Updated ntp packages fix security vulnerabilities:

If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a
cryptographically-weak default key is generated (CVE-2014-9293).

ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator
with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys (CVE-2014-9294).

A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger
buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto_recv() (when using autokey
authentication), ctl_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer
overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed
with the privilege of the ntpd process (CVE-2014-9295).

A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return
statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered.
This situation may be exploitable by an attacker (CVE-2014-9296).

The ntp package has been patched to fix these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 09:16:00 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  Code in ntp_proto.c:receive() was missing a 'return;' in the code path where an error was detected, which meant processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurred. We haven't found a way for this bug to affect system integrity. If there is no way to affect system integrity the base CVSS score for this bug is 0. If there is one avenue through which system integrity can be partially affected, the base score becomes a 5. If system integrity can be partially affected via all three integrity metrics, the CVSS base score become 7.5.  This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.    Mitigation:  Remove or comment out all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:23:12 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2670>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548ad06feXHK1HlZoY-WZVyynwvwAg>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c5)  Huzaifa S.
