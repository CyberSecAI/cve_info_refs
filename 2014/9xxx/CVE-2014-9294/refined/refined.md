### CVE-2014-9294

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
* The `ntp-keygen` utility, prior to version 4.2.7p230, used a weak, non-cryptographic random number generator with a weak seed to generate MD5 symmetric keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Use of a Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG):** The `ntp-keygen` utility employed a PRNG that wasn't suitable for cryptographic purposes.
*   **Weak Seed:** The PRNG was seeded with an insufficient amount of entropy, making the generated keys predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Key Guessing:** An attacker could potentially guess the generated MD5 keys due to the weak PRNG and seed.
*   **Spoofing:** With a compromised key, an attacker could spoof an NTP client or server, potentially injecting false time information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** While the vulnerability is in the key generation process, the generated keys could be used in an NTP network, allowing a remote attacker to exploit the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would require knowledge of the weak key generation process, or access to the system. They would need the ability to eavesdrop and obtain the keys, or use existing ones for impersonation on the NTP network.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.
*   The issue was fixed by using a current-technology cryptographic random number generator, either `RAND_bytes` from OpenSSL, or `arc4random()`.
*   It is recommended to regenerate MD5 keys that were explicitly created using `ntp-keygen`. The default installation does not use these keys.
