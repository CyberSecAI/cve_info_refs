slab: fix oops when reading /proc/slab\_allocators
commit 03787301420376ae41fbaf4267f4a6253d152ac5 upstream.
Commit b1cb0982bdd6 ("change the management method of free objects of
the slab") introduced a bug on slab leak detector
('/proc/slab\_allocators'). This detector works like as following
decription.
1. traverse all objects on all the slabs.
2. determine whether it is active or not.
3. if active, print who allocate this object.
but that commit changed the way how to manage free objects, so the logic
determining whether it is active or not is also changed. In before, we
regard object in cpu caches as inactive one, but, with this commit, we
mistakenly regard object in cpu caches as active one.
This intoduces kernel oops if DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC is enabled. If
DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC is enabled, kernel\_map\_pages() is used to detect who
corrupt free memory in the slab. It unmaps page table mapping if object
is free and map it if object is active. When slab leak detector check
object in cpu caches, it mistakenly think this object active so try to
access object memory to retrieve caller of allocation. At this point,
page table mapping to this object doesn't exist, so oops occurs.
Following is oops message reported from Dave.
It blew up when something tried to read /proc/slab\_allocators
(Just cat it, and you should see the oops below)

To fix the problem, I introduce an object status buffer on each slab.
With this, we can track object status precisely, so slab leak detector
would not access active object and no kernel oops would occur. Memory
overhead caused by this fix is only imposed to CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SLAB\_LEAK
which is mainly used for debugging, so memory overhead isn't big
problem.

ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow
commit 883a1d49f0d77d30012f114b2e19fc141beb3e8e upstream.
The ALSA control code expects that the range of assigned indices to a control is
continuous and does not overflow. Currently there are no checks to enforce this.
If a control with a overflowing index range is created that control becomes
effectively inaccessible and unremovable since snd\_ctl\_find\_id() will not be
able to find it. This patch adds a check that makes sure that controls with a
overflowing index range can not be created.

ALSA: control: Handle numid overflow
commit ac902c112d90a89e59916f751c2745f4dbdbb4bd upstream.
Each control gets automatically assigned its numids when the control is created.
The allocation is done by incrementing the numid by the amount of allocated
numids per allocation. This means that excessive creation and destruction of
controls (e.g. via SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD/REMOVE) can cause the id to
eventually overflow. Currently when this happens for the control that caused the
overflow kctl->id.numid + kctl->count will also over flow causing it to be
smaller than kctl->id.numid. Most of the code assumes that this is something
that can not happen, so we need to make sure that it won't happen

ALSA: control: Fix replacing user controls
commit 82262a46627bebb0febcc26664746c25cef08563 upstream.
There are two issues with the current implementation for replacing user
controls. The first is that the code does not check if the control is actually a
user control and neither does it check if the control is owned by the process
that tries to remove it. That allows userspace applications to remove arbitrary
controls, which can cause a user after free if a for example a driver does not
expect a control to be removed from under its feed.
The second issue is that on one hand when a control is replaced the
user\_ctl\_count limit is not checked and on the other hand the user\_ctl\_count is
increased (even though the number of user controls does not change). This allows
userspace, once the user\_ctl\_count limit as been reached, to repeatedly replace
a control until user\_ctl\_count overflows. Once that happens new controls can be
added effectively bypassing the user\_ctl\_count limit.
Both issues can be fixed by instead of open-coding the removal of the control
that is to be replaced to use snd\_ctl\_remove\_user\_ctl(). This function does
proper permission checks as well as decrements user\_ctl\_count after the control
has been removed.
Note that by using snd\_ctl\_remove\_user\_ctl() the check which returns -EBUSY at
beginning of the function if the control already exists is removed. This is not
a problem though since the check is quite useless, because the lock that is
protecting the control list is released between the check and before adding the
new control to the list, which means that it is possible that a different
control with the same settings is added to the list after the check. Luckily
there is another check that is done while holding the lock in snd\_ctl\_add(), so
we'll rely on that to make sure that the same control is not added twice.

ALSA: control: Protect user controls against concurrent access
commit 07f4d9d74a04aa7c72c5dae0ef97565f28f17b92 upstream.
The user-control put and get handlers as well as the tlv do not protect against
concurrent access from multiple threads. Since the state of the control is not
updated atomically it is possible that either two write operations or a write
and a read operation race against each other. Both can lead to arbitrary memory
disclosure. This patch introduces a new lock that protects user-controls from
concurrent access. Since applications typically access controls sequentially
than in parallel a single lock per card should be fine.

ALSA: hda - verify pin:converter connection on unsol event for HSW and VLV
commit b4f75aea553a2146bbdd159c397a2ac42cbb9902 upstream.
This patch will verify the pin's coverter selection for an active stream
when an unsol event reports this pin becomes available again after a display
mode change or hot-plug event.
For Haswell+ and Valleyview: display mode change or hot-plug can change the
transcoder:port connection and make all the involved audio pins share the 1st
converter. So the stream using 1st convertor will flow to multiple pins
but active streams using other converters will fail. This workaround
is to assure the pin selects the right conveter and an assigned converter is
not shared by other unused pins.

Under some conditions, especially when we are releasing a lot of memory into
the guest, we may not send timely pressure reports back to the host. Fix this
issue by reporting pressure in all contexts that can be active in this driver.

Make sure only to decrement the PM counters if they were actually
incremented.
Note that the USB PM counter, but not necessarily the driver core PM
counter, is reset when the interface is unbound.

USB: cdc-acm: fix broken runtime suspend
commit 140cb81ac8c625942a1d695875932c615767a526 upstream.
The current ACM runtime-suspend implementation is broken in several
ways:
Firstly, it buffers only the first write request being made while
suspended -- any further writes are silently dropped.
Secondly, writes being dropped also leak write urbs, which are never
reclaimed (until the device is unbound).
Thirdly, even the single buffered write is not cleared at shutdown
(which may happen before the device is resumed), something which can
lead to another urb leak as well as a PM usage-counter leak.
Fix this by implementing a delayed-write queue using urb anchors and
making sure to discard the queue properly at shutdown.

Fix race between write() and resume() due to improper locking that could
lead to writes being reordered.
Resume must be done atomically and susp\_count be protected by the
write\_lock in order to prevent racing with write(). This could otherwise
lead to writes being reordered if write() grabs the write\_lock after
susp\_count is decremented, but before the delayed urb is submitted.

MIPS: KVM: Allocate at least 16KB for exception handlers
commit 7006e2dfda9adfa40251093604db76d7e44263b3 upstream.
Each MIPS KVM guest has its own copy of the KVM exception vector. This
contains the TLB refill exception handler at offset 0x000, the general
exception handler at offset 0x180, and interrupt exception handlers at
offset 0x200 in case Cause\_IV=1. A common handler is copied to offset
0x2000 and offset 0x3000 is used for temporarily storing k1 during entry
from guest.
However the amount of memory allocated for this purpose is calculated as
0x200 rounded up to the next page boundary, which is insufficient if 4KB
pages are in use. This can lead to the common handler at offset 0x2000
being overwritten and infinitely recursive exceptions on the next exit
from the guest.
Increase the minimum size from 0x200 to 0x4000 to cover the full use of
the page.

KVM: lapic: sync highest ISR to hardware apic on EOI
commit fc57ac2c9ca8109ea97fcc594f4be436944230cc upstream.
When Hyper-V enlightenments are in effect, Windows prefers to issue an
Hyper-V MSR write to issue an EOI rather than an x2apic MSR write.
The Hyper-V MSR write is not handled by the processor, and besides
being slower, this also causes bugs with APIC virtualization. The
reason is that on EOI the processor will modify the highest in-service
interrupt (SVI) field of the VMCS, as explained in section 29.1.4 of
the SDM; every other step in EOI virtualization is already done by
apic\_send\_eoi or on VM entry, but this one is missing.
We need to do the same, and be careful not to muck with the isr\_count
and highest\_isr\_cache fields that are unused when virtual interrupt
delivery is enabled.

Its too easy to add thousand of UDP sockets on a particular bucket,

Early demux is supposed to be an optimization, we should avoid spending
too much time in it.
It is interesting to note \_\_udp4\_lib\_demux\_lookup() only tries to

10 is the threshold we already have in \_\_udp4\_lib\_lookup() to switch

vxlan: use dev->needed\_headroom instead of dev->hard\_header\_len
[ Upstream commit 2853af6a2ea1a8ed09b09dd4fb578e7f435e8d34 ]
When we mirror packets from a vxlan tunnel to other device,
the mirror device should see the same packets (that is, without
outer header). Because vxlan tunnel sets dev->hard\_header\_len,
tcf\_mirred() resets mac header back to outer mac, the mirror device
actually sees packets with outer headers
Vxlan tunnel should set dev->needed\_headroom instead of
dev->hard\_header\_len, like what other ip tunnels do. This fixes
the above problem.

rtnetlink: fix userspace API breakage for iproute2 < v3.9.0
[ Upstream commit e5eca6d41f53db48edd8cf88a3f59d2c30227f8e ]
When running RHEL6 userspace on a current upstream kernel, "ip link"
fails to show VF information.
The reason is a kernel<->userspace API change introduced by commit
88c5b5ce5cb57 ("rtnetlink: Call nlmsg\_parse() with correct header length"),
after which the kernel does not see iproute2's IFLA\_EXT\_MASK attribute
in the netlink request.
iproute2 adjusted for the API change in its commit 63338dca4513
("libnetlink: Use ifinfomsg instead of rtgenmsg in rtnl\_wilddump\_req\_filter").
The problem has been noticed before:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=136692296022182&w=2
(Subject: Re: getting VF link info seems to be broken in 3.9-rc8)
We can do better than tell those with old userspace to upgrade. We can
recognize the old iproute2 in the kernel by checking the netlink message
length. Even when including the IFLA\_EXT\_MASK attribute, its netlink
message is shorter than struct ifinfomsg.
With this patch "ip link" shows VF information in both old and new
iproute2 versions.

sctp: Fix sk\_ack\_backlog wrap-around problem
[ Upstream commit d3217b15a19a4779c39b212358a5c71d725822ee ]
Consider the scenario:
For a TCP-style socket, while processing the COOKIE\_ECHO chunk in
sctp\_sf\_do\_5\_1D\_ce(), after it has passed a series of sanity check,
a new association would be created in sctp\_unpack\_cookie(), but afterwards,
some processing maybe failed, and sctp\_association\_free() will be called to
free the previously allocated association, in sctp\_association\_free(),
sk\_ack\_backlog value is decremented for this socket, since the initial
value for sk\_ack\_backlog is 0, after the decrement, it will be 65535,
a wrap-around problem happens, and if we want to establish new associations
afterward in the same socket, ABORT would be triggered since sctp deem the
accept queue as full.
Fix this issue by only decrementing sk\_ack\_backlog for associations in
the endpoint's list.

ipv4: fix a race in ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb()
[ Upstream commit 9709674e68646cee5a24e3000b3558d25412203a ]
Alexey gave a AddressSanitizer[1] report that finally gave a good hint
at where was the origin of various problems already reported by Dormando
in the past [2]
Problem comes from the fact that UDP can have a lockless TX path, and
concurrent threads can manipulate sk\_dst\_cache, while another thread,
is holding socket lock and calls \_\_sk\_dst\_set() in
ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb() (this was added in linux-3.8)
It seems that all we need to do is to use sk\_dst\_check() and
sk\_dst\_set() so that all the writers hold same spinlock
(sk->sk\_dst\_lock) to prevent corruptions.
TCP stack do not need this protection, as all sk\_dst\_cache writers hold
the socket lock.

sfc: PIO:Restrict to 64bit arch and use 64-bit writes.
[ Upstream commit daf37b556e437ec1ea1a597dcfeff338068380e1 ]
Fixes:ee45fd92c739
("sfc: Use TX PIO for sufficiently small packets")
The linux net driver uses memcpy\_toio() in order to copy into
the PIO buffers.
Even on a 64bit machine this causes 32bit accesses to a write-
combined memory region.
There are hardware limitations that mean that only 64bit
naturally aligned accesses are safe in all cases.
Due to being write-combined memory region two 32bit accesses
may be coalesced to form a 64bit non 64bit aligned access.
Solution was to open-code the memory copy routines using pointers
and to only enable PIO for x86\_64 machines.
Not tested on platforms other than x86\_64 because this patch
disables the PIO feature on other platforms.
Compile-tested on x86 to ensure that works.
The WARN\_ON\_ONCE() code in the previous version of this patch
has been moved into the internal sfc debug driver as the
assertion was unnecessary in the upstream kernel code.
This bug fix applies to v3.13 and v3.14 stable branches.

sh\_eth: use RNC mode for packet reception
[ Upstream commit 530aa2d0d9d55ab2775d47621ddf4b5b15bc1110 ]
The current behaviour of the sh\_eth driver is not to use the RNC bit
for the receive ring. This means that every packet recieved is not only
generating an IRQ but it also stops the receive ring DMA as well until
the driver re-enables it after unloading the packet.
This means that a number of the following errors are generated due to
the receive packet FIFO overflowing due to nowhere to put packets:
net eth0: Receive FIFO Overflow
Since feedback from Yoshihiro Shimoda shows that every supported LSI
for this driver should have the bit enabled it seems the best way is
to remove the RMCR default value from the per-system data and just
write it when initialising the RMCR value. This is discussed in
the message (http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg284912.html).
I have tested the RMCR\_RNC configuration with NFS root filesystem and
the driver has not failed yet. There are further test reports from
Sergei Shtylov and others for both the R8A7790 and R8A7791.
There is also feedback fron Cao Minh Hiep[1] which reports the
same issue in (http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/316285)
showing this fixes issues with losing UDP datagrams under iperf.

Commit efe4208 ("ipv6: make lookups simpler and faster") introduced a
regression in udp\_v6\_mcast\_next(), resulting in multicast packets not
reaching the destination sockets under certain conditions.
The packet's IPv6 addresses are wrongly compared to the IPv6 addresses
from the function's socket argument, which indicates the starting point
for looping, instead of the loop variable. If the addresses from the
first socket do not match the packet's addresses, no socket in the list
will match.

The reason for the oops is that IMA-appraisal uses "kernel\_read()" when
file is closed. kernel\_read() honors LSM security hook which calls
Apparmor handler, which uses current->nsproxy->mnt\_ns. The 'guilty'
commit changed the order of cleanup code so that nsproxy->mnt\_ns was
not already available for Apparmor.
Discussion about the issue with Al Viro and Eric W. Biederman suggested
that kernel\_read() is too high-level for IMA. Another issue, except
security checking, that was identified is mandatory locking. kernel\_read
honors it as well and it might prevent IMA from calculating necessary hash.
It was suggested to use simplified version of the function without security
and locking checks.
This patch introduces special version ima\_kernel\_read(), which skips security
and mandatory locking checking. It prevents the kernel oops to happen.

ima: audit log files opened with O\_DIRECT flag
commit f9b2a735bdddf836214b5dca74f6ca7712e5a08c upstream.
Files are measured or appraised based on the IMA policy. When a
file, in policy, is opened with the O\_DIRECT flag, a deadlock
occurs.
The first attempt at resolving this lockdep temporarily removed the
O\_DIRECT flag and restored it, after calculating the hash. The
second attempt introduced the O\_DIRECT\_HAVELOCK flag. Based on this
flag, do\_blockdev\_direct\_IO() would skip taking the i\_mutex a second
time. The third attempt, by Dmitry Kasatkin, resolves the i\_mutex
locking issue, by re-introducing the IMA mutex, but uncovered
another problem. Reading a file with O\_DIRECT flag set, writes
directly to userspace pages. A second patch allocates a user-space
like memory. This works for all IMA hooks, except ima\_file\_free(),
which is called on \_\_fput() to recalculate the file hash.
Until this last issue is addressed, do not 'collect' the
measurement for measuring, appraising, or auditing files opened
with the O\_DIRECT flag set. Based on policy, permit or deny file
access. This patch defines a new IMA policy rule option named
'permit\_directio'. Policy rules could be defined, based on LSM
or other criteria, to permit specific applications to open files
with the O\_DIRECT flag set.

commit 1d2b60a5545942b1376cb48c1d55843d71e3a08f upstream.
This patch adds an explicit check in chap\_server\_compute\_md5() to ensure
the CHAP\_C value received from the initiator during mutual authentication
does not match the original CHAP\_C provided by the target.
This is in line with RFC-3720, section 8.2.1:
Originators MUST NOT reuse the CHAP challenge sent by the Responder
for the other direction of a bidirectional authentication.
Responders MUST check for this condition and close the iSCSI TCP
connection if it occurs.

target: Fix NULL pointer dereference for XCOPY in target\_put\_sess\_cmd
commit 0ed6e189e3f6ac3a25383ed5cc8b0ac24c9b97b7 upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference regression bug that was
introduced with:
commit 1e1110c43b1cda9fe77fc4a04835e460550e6b3c
Author: Mikulas Patocka
Date: Sat May 17 06:49:22 2014 -0400
target: fix memory leak on XCOPY
Now that target\_put\_sess\_cmd() -> kref\_put\_spinlock\_irqsave() is
called with a valid se\_cmd->cmd\_kref, a NULL pointer dereference
is triggered because the XCOPY passthrough commands don't have
an associated se\_session pointer.
To address this bug, go ahead and checking for a NULL se\_sess pointer
within target\_put\_sess\_cmd(), and call se\_cmd->se\_tfo->release\_cmd()
to release the XCOPY's xcopy\_pt\_cmd memory.

rtc: rtc-at91rm9200: fix infinite wait for ACKUPD irq
commit 2fe121e1f5aa3bf31b418a9790db6c400e922291 upstream.
The rtc user must wait at least 1 sec between each time/calandar update
(see atmel's datasheet chapter "Updating Time/Calendar").
Use the 1Hz interrupt to update the at91\_rtc\_upd\_rdy flag and wait for
the at91\_rtc\_wait\_upd\_rdy event if the rtc is not ready.
This patch fixes a deadlock in an uninterruptible wait when the RTC is
updated more than once every second. AFAICT the bug is here from the
beginning, but I think we should at least backport this fix to 3.10 and
the following longterm and stable releases.

ipv4: fix a race in ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb()Alexey gave a AddressSanitizer[1] report that finally gave a good hint
at where was the origin of various problems already reported by Dormando
in the past [2]
Problem comes from the fact that UDP can have a lockless TX path, and
concurrent threads can manipulate sk\_dst\_cache, while another thread,
is holding socket lock and calls \_\_sk\_dst\_set() in
ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb() (this was added in linux-3.8)
It seems that all we need to do is to use sk\_dst\_check() and
sk\_dst\_set() so that all the writers hold same spinlock
(sk->sk\_dst\_lock) to prevent corruptions.
TCP stack do not need this protection, as all sk\_dst\_cache writers hold
the socket lock.

# Android Security Bulletin—February 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published February 06, 2017 | Updated February 8, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of February 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on January 03,
2017 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-02-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-02-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-02-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-02-01
    and 2017-02-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the February
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-02-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-02-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-02-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-02-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2017-02-01]`
* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2017-02-05]`

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the February 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of February 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-02-01](#2017-02-01-details) and
[2017-02-05](#2017-02-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

ipv4: fix a race in ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb()

Alexey gave a AddressSanitizer[1] report that finally gave a good hint
at where was the origin of various problems already reported by Dormando
in the past [2]

Problem comes from the fact that UDP can have a lockless TX path, and
concurrent threads can manipulate sk_dst_cache, while another thread,
is holding socket lock and calls __sk_dst_set() in
ip4_datagram_release_cb() (this was added in linux-3.8)

It seems that all we need to do is to use sk_dst_check() and
sk_dst_set() so that all the writers hold same spinlock
(sk->sk_dst_lock) to prevent corruptions.

TCP stack do not need this protection, as all sk_dst_cache writers hold
the socket lock.
