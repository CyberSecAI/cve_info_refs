Fix #17297: XSS in string\_insert\_hrefs

```
The URL matching regex in the function did not validate the protocol,
allowing an attacker to use 'javascript://' to execute arbitrary code.

Issue was discovered by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>)
and reported by Offensive Security (<http://www.offensive-security.com/>).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
The URL matching regex in the function did not validate the protocol,
allowing an attacker to use 'javascript://' to execute arbitrary code.

Issue was discovered by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>)
and reported by Offensive Security (<http://www.offensive-security.com/>).

The URL matching regex in the function did not validate the protocol,
allowing an attacker to use 'javascript://' to execute arbitrary code.

Issue was discovered by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>)
and reported by Offensive Security (<http://www.offensive-security.com/>).

| Description | Add a bugnote with this line for PoC: &javascript://%E2%80%A8alert(document.domain)  The problem lies in <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/blob/master/core/string_api.php>, the function "string\_insert\_hrefs" doesn't validate the protocol, which is why one can make this link (with some quirks) and execute javascript. | | | | |

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mantis bug tracking
system, which may result in phishing, information disclosure, CAPTCHA
bypass, SQL injection, cross-site scripting or the execution of arbitrary
PHP code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis packages.

# CVE Request: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in MantisBT

---

*From*: Damien Regad <dregad () mantisbt org>

*Date*: Mon, 01 Dec 2014 08:25:33 +0100

---

```

Greetings,

Please assign CVE IDs for the following 5 issues.

Thanks in advance

D. Regad
MantisBT Developer
<http://www.mantisbt.org>

1. XSS in extended project browser
==================================

```
MantisBT has two modes of operations to select the current project. The
second of these, so-called the "extended project browser", is vulnerable
to XSS attacks as the code did not check that a given subproject id is
indeed an integer.
```

```
This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code by forging
the MantisBT project cookie.
```

Affected versions:
>= 1.1.0a1, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:

```
Issue was discovered by Paul Richards and fixed by Paul Richards and
Damien Regad.
```

References:
Further details available in our issue tracker [2]

[1] <http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/511564cc>
[2] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17890>

2. XSS in projax_api.php
========================

```
The Projax library used in MantisBT 1.2.x does not properly escape html
strings. An attacker could take advantage of this to perform an XSS
attack using the profile/Platform field.
```

Affected versions:
>= 1.1.0a3, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [3]

Credit:

```
Issue was reported by Offensive Security via their bug bounty program
(<http://www.offensive-security.com/bug-bounty-program/>).
```

It was fixed by Paul Richards.

References:
Further details available in our issue tracker [4]

[4] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17583>

3. XSS in admin panel / copy_field.php
======================================

```
Use of unsanitized parameters in this admin page allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
```

Affected versions:
<= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [5]

Credit:

```
Issue was reported by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>) as
part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [7].
```

It was fixed by Paul Richards.

References:
Further details available in our issue tracker [6]

[6] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17876>
[7] <http://www.offensive-security.com/bug-bounty-program/>

4. XSS in string_insert_hrefs()
===============================

```
The URL matching regex in the string\_insert\_hrefs() function did not
validate the protocol, allowing an attacker to use 'javascript://' to
execute arbitrary code.
```

Affected versions:
>= 1.2.0a1, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [8]

Credit:

```
Issue was discovered by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>) and
reported by Offensive Security (<http://www.offensive-security.com/>).
```

It was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).

References:
Further details available in our issue tracker [9]

[8] <http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/05378e00>
[9] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=17297>

5. XSS in file uploads
======================

```
An attacker could upload a malicious Flash file renamed to bear a
recognized image extension (e.g. xss.swf ==> screenshot.png). Since by
default MantisBT is configured to allow images to be displayed inline,
it is possible to get the Flash to execute.
```

Affected versions:
<= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [10]

Credit:

```
Issue was reported by Mathias Karlsson (<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>) as
part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [7].
It was fixed by Damien Regad with contribution from Victor Boctor
(MantisBT Developers).
```
