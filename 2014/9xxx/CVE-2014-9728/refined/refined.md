Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the UDF filesystem implementation of the Linux kernel, specifically in how it handles symlink lengths and allocation sizes when reading inodes and symlinks. There's a lack of proper validation for these lengths, which allows for out-of-bounds reads and other issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient length validation:** The UDF filesystem implementation doesn't adequately check the length of symlink targets, component identifiers and overall inode sizes, leading to potential buffer over-reads or other memory corruption issues.
*   **Incorrect component length handling:** The `udf_pc_to_char` function relies on component lengths that might be unused, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Missing size consistency:** In `udf_read_inode`, there's no assurance of data-structure size consistency while loading inodes.
*   **Symlink size validation missing:** The code does not check if the symlink size exceeds one block, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user can cause a system crash by mounting a crafted UDF filesystem image, triggering an out-of-bounds read and crashing the system.

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can potentially expose sensitive data from the kernel memory through a crafted UDF image.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring a user to mount a specially crafted UDF filesystem image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to have a local account with the capability to mount filesystems, typically requiring elevated privileges in most standard configurations.
*   **Crafted Filesystem Image:** The attacker needs to create or obtain a malicious UDF filesystem image with specific attributes to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions before 3.18.2.
*   The affected code includes `fs/udf/inode.c`, `fs/udf/symlink.c` and `fs/udf/unicode.c`.
*   Patches address the length validation in `udf_pc_to_char` function in `fs/udf/symlink.c`, and also adds a size check to ensure inodes and symlinks sizes fit within allocated memory.
*   SUSE rates this as a low severity issue.
*   Red Hat states the issue has a moderate impact.
*   Specific commits from the upstream kernel source address the identified issues.

In summary, CVE-2014-9728 is a locally exploitable vulnerability in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem implementation that can lead to denial of service and, potentially, information disclosure due to missing length and size validation when handling crafted UDF images.

**NOTE:** Some content related to CVE-2014-9729 and CVE-2014-9730 is also present because they are related to UDF filesystem issues and are fixed within the same commits/patches, but the analysis above is specific to CVE-2014-9728.
