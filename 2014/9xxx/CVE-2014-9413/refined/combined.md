### [Works. Simple and lightweight plugin.](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-work-it-will-block-every-user/)

October 15, 2017

I previously rated this plugin as 1 star because it locked me out of my own website. It turns out, it was because I was on the wrong Wi-Fi network. Now that I got it to work, I am giving it 5 stars. A simple and lightweight plugin and it is exactly what I was looking for to ban IP addresses.

Locked me out of my site, I had to FTP in and delete the plugin.
Everything looks fine until you log out then BAM it blocked me.
It may have worked at one time but it doesn’t work now.

The simple ip ban is purely simple. Very easy to understand. You just type the ip you want to ban and that very ip get banned. No criteria, filters or anything complicated. You just need something like limit-login-attempts-like widget or tool or whatever to find those suspicious ip. Then you type those ip to block them from attempting to login your site again.
