  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The characters of a signed pointer `*p` are used as an index to the array `cvs_shifts`. Because `p` is signed, when `p[i]` (e.g., 0xff) is converted to unsigned `size_t`, it is treated as 0xffffffff instead of 255.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Signed to unsigned conversion vulnerability",
       "Out-of-bounds read"

    "impact": "Denial of service due to out-of-bounds read, and potential for other impacts",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting specific inputs (e.g., username or password) that lead to out-of-bounds access",
