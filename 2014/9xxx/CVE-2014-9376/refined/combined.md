### @NickSampanis **[NickSampanis](/NickSampanis)** commented [Oct 17, 2014](#issue-46105693)

The dhcp dissector does not check if the size variable is less than 3, as a result a huge allocation might occur which leads to denial of service and a write to out of bounds of buffer

Sorry, something went wrong.

| why do you cast to int? it is uint32 if I read correctly. is the cast really needed? |

### **[NickSampanis](/NickSampanis)** commented [Dec 16, 2014](#issuecomment-67133750)

| I should cast to int because i should check if gg\_len-22 is less than zero, uint32 is always positive. I will give a brief example. Lets assume that gg\_len is equals to 21 if ((gg->type == GG\_LOGIN50\_CMD) && !FROM\_SERVER("gg", PACKET)) { strncpy(tbuf2,gg\_login50->description, (gg->len)-22); tbuf2[(gg->len)-22]='\0'; } will end up copying -1(0xffffffff) bytes from gg\_login50->description to tbuf2. A simple way to avoid this is to check if gg->len-22 is less than zero, but gg->len is unsigned, so even if the gg->len is 21 the statment if (gg->len-22 < 0) would be false(because gg->len after the subtraction will contain the value 4294967295), unless of course if we cast back to signed integer. I recommend you to read "The Art of Software Security Assessment" if you really want to understand this or dive in to assembly and try to understand the difference between jle and jbe |

| ops sorry, yes of course I understand now :)  I thought you had written different code, let me explain, I missed the "<" for a ">"  so now, what abut this code?  ```  if (gg->len < 22)  return NULL;  ```  instead of  ```  if ((int)gg->len-22 < 0)  return NULL;  ``` |

### @NickSampanis **[NickSampanis](/NickSampanis)** commented [Oct 17, 2014](#issue-46134724)

the characters of pointer \*p is used as an index to the array cvs\_shifts. We control these characters as password and while it seems thats a valid action because cvs\_shifts has size of 256, it isn't. The reason is that p is a signed pointer so when p[i](which is say 0xff) will be converted to unsigned size\_t as 0xffffffff and not as 255

Sorry, something went wrong.
