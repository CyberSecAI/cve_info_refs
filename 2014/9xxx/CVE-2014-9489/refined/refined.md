  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `git grep` with the `-O` or `--open-files-in-pager` option, which allows execution of arbitrary commands via a pager process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of `git grep` command",
       "Lack of sanitization of user-provided search queries"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary shell commands, potentially leading to shell access on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a search query containing `-O<arbitrary command>` or `--open-files-in-pager <arbritary command>` within the wiki's search field. This requires that the search also find the string 'master' or the name of the git branch.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit search queries on the Gollum wiki interface. They also need to know or guess the name of the git branch being used (usually master) and include that string in the search."
