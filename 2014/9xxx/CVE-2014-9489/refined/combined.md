## DESCRIPTION

Adapter for [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) to use Grit at the backend.

## CONTRIBUTING

Make sure the [git adapter specs](https://github.com/gollum/adapter_specs) pass by running `rake`, but also make sure that the [gollum-lib](https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib) specs pass when using your branch of this adapter as a backend:

* Clone the latest version of gollum-lib.
* Change gollum-lib's Gemfile so as to use your local version of this adapter, i.e.:

```
-gem 'gollum-grit_adapter'
+gem 'gollum-grit_adapter', :path => "/path/to/your/gollum-lib_grit_adapter"
```

* Run the gollum-lib specs and see if they pass.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki) for extensive documentation, along with [screenshots](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Screenshots) of Gollum's features.

## DESCRIPTION

Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git. A Gollum Wiki is simply a git repository of a specific nature:

* A Gollum repository's contents are human-editable text or markup files.
* Pages may be organized into directories any way you choose.
* Other content can also be included, for example images, PDFs and headers/footers for your pages.
* Gollum pages:

  + May be written in a variety of [markups](#markups).
  + Can be edited with your favourite editor (changes will be visible after committing) or with the built-in web interface.
  + Can be displayed in all versions, reverted, etc.
* Gollum strives to be [compatible](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/5.0-release-notes#compatibility-option) with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/#create-or-edit-wiki-pages-locally) wikis.

  + Just clone your GitHub/GitLab wiki and view and edit it locally!
* Gollum supports advanced functionality like:

  + Diagrams using [Mermaid](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#mermaid-diagrams) or [PlantUML](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#plantuml-diagrams)
  + [BibTeX and Citation support](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/BibTeX-and-Citations)
  + Annotations using [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#criticmarkup-annotations)
  + [Mathematics](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#mathematics) via KaTeX or MathJax
  + [Macros](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Standard-Macros)
  + [Redirects](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#redirects)
  + [RSS Feed](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/5.0-release-notes#rss-feed) of latest changes
  + ...and [more](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki)

### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Gollum runs both on Unix-like systems and on Windows.

Gollum runs either using 'normal' Ruby (MRI) or [JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby) (Ruby on the Java Virtual Machine). On Windows, Gollum runs only using JRuby (either from source, or [prebuilt](#as-a-web-application-resource-java)).

On MRI, Gollum uses the [rugged](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged) git library, while on JRuby/Java it utilizes the [rjgit](https://github.com/repotag/rjgit) and [JGit](https://eclipse.dev/jgit/) libraries. See [here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Git-adapters) for more info.

## INSTALLATION

### As a Ruby Gem

Ruby is best installed either via [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or a package manager of choice. Then simply:
`gem install gollum`

Installation examples for individual systems can be seen [here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Installation).

To run, simply:

1. Run: `gollum /path/to/wiki` where `/path/to/wiki` is an initialized Git repository.
2. Open `http://localhost:4567` in your browser.

### Via Docker

See [here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Docker) for instructions on how to run Gollum via Docker.

### As a web application resource (Java)

The [latest Release](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/releases/) of Gollum will always contain a downloadable `gollum.war` file that can be directly executed on any system with a working Java installation:

`java -jar gollum.war -S gollum <your-gollum-arguments-here>`

When using the `.war`, please be sure to pass [absolute paths](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Java-WAR#absolute-paths-issue) to your Gollum arguments.

### Misc

See [below](#running-from-source) for information on running Gollum from source, as a Rack app, and more.

## MARKUPS

Gollum allows using different markup languages on different wiki pages. It presently ships with support for the following markups:

* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (see [below](#Markdown-flavors) for more information on Markdown flavors)
* [RDoc](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/)

You can easily activate support for other markups by installing additional renderers (any that are supported by [github-markup](https://github.com/github/markup)):

* [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/) -- `gem install asciidoctor`
* [Creole](http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/CheatSheet) -- `gem install creole`
* [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help%3AFormatting) -- `gem install wikicloth`
* [Org](http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html) -- `gem install org-ruby`
* [Pod](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) -- requires Perl >= 5.10 (the `perl` command must be available on your command line)
  + Lower versions should install `Pod::Simple` from CPAN.
* [ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html) -- requires python >= 3
  + Note that Gollum will also need you to install `docutils` for python
* [Textile](http://redcloth.org/hobix.com/textile/quick.html) -- `gem install RedCloth`

### Markdown flavors

By default, Gollum ships with the `kramdown` gem to render Markdown. However, you can use any [Markdown renderer supported by github-markup](https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/lib/github/markup/markdown.rb). This includes [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) support via the `commonmarker` gem. The first installed renderer from the list will be used (e.g., `redcarpet` will NOT be used if `github/markdown` is installed). Just `gem install` the renderer of your choice.

See [here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Custom-rendering-gems) for instructions on how to use custom rendering gems and set custom options.

## RUNNING FROM SOURCE

1. `git clone https://github.com/gollum/gollum`
2. `cd gollum`
3. `[sudo] bundle install`
4. `bundle exec bin/gollum`
5. Open `http://localhost:4567` in your browser.

### Rack

Gollum can also be run with any [rack-compatible web server](https://github.com/rack/rack#supported-web-servers). More on that [over here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Rack).

### Rack, with an authentication server

Gollum can also be run alongside a CAS (Central Authentication Service) SSO (single sign-on) server. With a bit of tweaking, this adds basic user-support to Gollum. To see an example and an explanation, navigate [over here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Rack-and-CAS-SSO).

### Service

Gollum can also be run as a service. More on that [over here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-as-a-service).

## ENVIRONMENT

Gollum uses the environment variable `APP_ENV` primarily to control how the underlying Sinatra app behaves:

* `development` – reload the app on every request
* `production` – load the app only once

## CONFIGURATION

Gollum comes with the command line options listed below. Note that there are some additional 'minor' options to tweak Gollum's behaviour that do not have commandline options, but can be configured in [config.rb](#config-file).

| Option | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --host | [HOST] | Specify the hostname or IP address to listen on. Default: '0.0.0.0'.1 |
| --port | [PORT] | Specify the port to bind Gollum with. Default: `4567`. |
| --config | [FILE] | Specify path to Gollum's [configuration file](#Config-file). |
| --ref | [REF] | Specify the git branch to serve. Default: `master`. |
| --bare | none | Tell Gollum that the git repository should be treated as bare. |
| --adapter | [ADAPTER] | Launch Gollum using a specific git adapter. Default: `rugged`.2 |
| --base-path | [PATH] | Specify the leading portion of all Gollum URLs (path info). Setting this to `/wiki` will make the wiki accessible under `http://localhost:4567/wiki/`. Default: `/`. |
| --page-file-dir | [PATH] | Specify the subdirectory for all pages. If set, Gollum will only serve pages from this directory and its subdirectories. Default: repository root. |
| --static, --no-static | none | Use static assets. Defaults to false in development/test, true in production/staging. |
| --assets | [PATH] | Set the path to look for static assets. |
| --css | none | Tell Gollum to inject custom CSS into each page. Uses `custom.css` from wiki root.3 |
| --js | none | Tell Gollum to inject custom JS into each page. Uses `custom.js` from wiki root.3 |
| --no-edit | none | Disable the feature of editing pages. |
| --allow-uploads | [MODE] | Enable file uploads. If set to `dir`, Gollum will store all uploads in the `/uploads/` directory in repository root. If set to `page`, Gollum will store each upload at the currently edited page.4 |
| --math | [RENDERER] | Enable rendering of mathematical equations. Valid renderers: mathjax, katex. Default: katex. Add custom configuration for the renderer to math.config.js and commit it to the repo. |
| --critic-markup | none | Enable support for annotations using [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/). |
| --irb | none | Launch Gollum in "console mode", with a [predefined API](https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib/). |
| --h1-title | none | Tell Gollum to use the first `<h1>` as page title. |
| --no-display-metadata | none | Do not render metadata tables in pages. |
| --user-icons | [MODE] | Tell Gollum to use specific user icons for history view. Can be set to `gravatar`, `identicon` or `none`. Default: `none`. |
| --template-dir | [PATH] | Specify custom mustache template directory. Only overrides templates that exist in this directory. |
| --template-page | none | Use \_Template in root as a template for new pages. Must be committed. |
| --emoji | none | Parse and interpret emoji tags (e.g. `:heart:`) except when the leading colon is backslashed (e.g. `\:heart:`). |
| --lenient-tag-lookup | none | Internal links resolve case-insensitively, will treat spaces as hyphens, and will match the first page found with a certain filename, anywhere in the repository. Provides compatibility with Gollum 4.x. |
| --help | none | Display the list of options on the command line. |
| --version | none | Display the current version of Gollum. |
| --versions | none | Display the current version of Gollum and auxiliary gems. |

**Notes:**

1. The `0.0.0.0` IP address allows remote access. Should you wish for Gollum to turn into a personal Wiki, use `127.0.0.1`.
2. Before using `--adapter`, you should probably read [this](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Git-adapters) first.
3. When `--css` or `--js` is used, respective files must be committed to your git repository or you will get a 302 redirect to the create a page.
4. Files can be uploaded simply by dragging and dropping them onto the editor's text area when `--allow-uploads` is used.

### Config file

When `--config` option is used, certain inner parts of Gollum can be customized. This is used throughout our wiki for certain user-level alterations, among which [customizing supported markups](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Formats-and-extensions) will probably stand out.

See [here](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Sample-config.rb) for documentation about settings configurable in `config.rb`.

**All of the mentioned alterations and options work both for Gollum's config file (`config.rb`) and Rack's config file (`config.ru`).**

## DESCRIPTION

[Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) is a simple wiki system built on
top of Git that powers GitHub Wikis.

Gollum-lib is the Ruby API that allows you to retrieve raw or formatted wiki
content from a Git repository, write new content to the repository, and collect
various meta data about the wiki as a whole.

Gollum-lib follows the rules of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and uses
[TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) for inline documentation.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* Ruby 2.4.0+
* Unix like operating system (OS X, Ubuntu, Debian, and more)
* Will not work on Windows with the default [rugged](https://github.com/github/grit) adapter, but works via JRuby.

## INSTALLATION

The best way to install Gollum-lib is with RubyGems:

```
$ [sudo] gem install gollum-lib
```

If you're installing from source, you can use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to pick up all the
gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

In order to use the various formats that Gollum supports, you will need to
separately install the necessary dependencies for each format. You only need
to install the dependencies for the formats that you plan to use.

* [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) -- `gem install asciidoctor`
* [Creole](http://wikicreole.org/) -- `gem install creole`
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) -- `gem install redcarpet`
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) -- `gem install github-markdown`
* [Org](http://orgmode.org/) -- `gem install org-ruby`
* [Pod](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perlpod.pod) -- `Pod::Simple::HTML` comes with Perl >= 5.10. Lower versions should install Pod::Simple from CPAN.
* [RDoc](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/)
* [ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) -- `easy_install docutils`
* [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) -- `gem install RedCloth`
* [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help%3AFormatting) -- `gem install wikicloth`

## SYNTAX

Gollum supports a variety of formats and extensions (Markdown, MediaWiki, Textile, …).
On top of these formats Gollum lets you insert headers, footers, links, image, math and more.

Check out the [Gollum Wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki) for all of Gollum's formats and syntactic options.

## API DOCUMENTATION

Initialize the `Gollum::Repo` object:

```
# Require rubygems if necessary
require 'rubygems'

# Require the Gollum library
require 'gollum-lib'

# Create a new Gollum::Wiki object by initializing it with the path to the
# Git repository.
wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new("my-gollum-repo.git")
# => <Gollum::Wiki>
```

By default, internal wiki links are all absolute from the root. To specify a different
base path, you can specify the `:base_path` option:

```
wiki = Gollum::Wiki.new("my-gollum-repo.git", :base_path => "/wiki")
```

Note that `base_path` just modifies the links.

Get the latest version of the given human or canonical page name:

```
page = wiki.page('/page name') # Finds pages in the root directory of the wiki that are named 'page name' with a valid extension.
# => <Gollum::Page>

page = wiki.page('page name') # For convenience, you can leave out the '/' in front. Paths are assumed to be relative to '/'.
# => <Gollum::Page>

page = wiki.page('page name.md') # You can also specifiy the extension explicitly to disambiguate between pages with the same name, but different formats.
# => <Gollum::Page>

page.raw_data
# => "# My wiki page"

page.formatted_data
# => "<h1>My wiki page</h1>"

page.format
# => :markdown

vsn = page.version
# => <Gollum::Git::Commit>

vsn.id
# => '3ca43e12377ea1e32ea5c9ce5992ec8bf266e3e5'
```

Get the footer (if any) for a given page:

```
page.footer
# => <Gollum::Page>
```

Get the header (if any) for a given page:

```
page.header
# => <Gollum::Page>
```

Get a list of versions for a given page:

```
vsns = wiki.page('page-name').versions
# => [<Gollum::Git::Commit, <Gollum::Git::Commit, <Gollum::Git::Commit>]

vsns.first.id
# => '3ca43e12377ea1e32ea5c9ce5992ec8bf266e3e5'

vsns.first.authored_date
# => Sun Mar 28 19:11:21 -0700 2010
```

Get a specific version of a given canonical page file:

```
wiki.page('page name', '5ec521178e0eec4dc39741a8978a2ba6616d0f0a')
```

Get the latest version of a given static file:

```
file = wiki.file('asset.js')
# => <Gollum::File>

file.raw_data
# => "alert('hello');"

file.version
# => <Gollum::Git::Commit>
```

Get a specific version of a given static file:

```
wiki.file('asset.js', '5ec521178e0eec4dc39741a8978a2ba6616d0f0a')
```

Get an in-memory Page preview (useful for generating previews for web
interfaces):

```
preview = wiki.preview_page("My Page", "# Contents", :markdown)
preview.formatted_data
# => "<h1>Contents</h1>"
```

Methods that write to the repository require a Hash of commit data that takes
the following form:

```
commit = { :message => 'commit message',
           :name => 'Tom Preston-Werner',
           :email => 'tom@github.com' }
```

Write a new version of a page (the file will be created if it does not already
exist) and commit the change. The file will be written at the repo root if no subdirectory is specified.

```
wiki.write_page('Subdirectory/Page Name', :markdown, 'Page contents', commit)
```

Update an existing page. If the format is different than the page's current
format, the file name will be changed to reflect the new format.

```
page = wiki.page('Page Name')
wiki.update_page(page, page.name, page.format, 'Page contents', commit)
```

To delete a page and commit the change:

```
wiki.delete_page(page, commit)
```

Register or unregister a hook to be called after a page commit:

```
Gollum::Hook.register(:post_commit, :hook_id) do |committer, sha1|
  # Your code here
end

Gollum::Hook.unregister(:post_commit, :hook_id)
```

Register or unregister a hook to be called after the wiki is initialized:

```
Gollum::Hook.register(:post_wiki_initialize, :hook_id) do |wiki|
  # Your code here
end

Gollum::Hook.unregister(:post_wiki_initialize, :hook_id)
```

A combination of both hooks can be used to pull from a remote after
`:post_wiki_initialize` and push to a remote after `:post_commit` which in
effect keeps the remote in sync both ways. Keep in mind that it may not be
possible to resolve all conflicts automatically.

## WINDOWS FILENAME VALIDATION

Note that filenames on windows must not contain any of the following characters `\ / : * ? " < > |`. See [this support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177506) for details.

## CONTRIBUTE

If you'd like to hack on Gollum-lib, start by forking the repo on GitHub:

<http://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib>

To get all of the dependencies, install the gem first. The best way to get
your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
2. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
3. Hack away
4. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `rake`
5. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
6. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
7. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
8. Push the branch up to GitHub
9. Send a pull request to the gollum/gollum-lib project.

## RELEASING

Gollum-lib uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Having `x.y.z` :

For z releases:

```
$ rake bump
$ rake release
```

For x.y releases:

```
$ rake gemspec
$ rake release
```

## BUILDING THE GEM FROM MASTER

```
$ gem uninstall -aIx gollum-lib
$ git clone https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib.git
$ cd gollum-lib
gollum-lib$ rake build
gollum-lib$ rake install
```

## RUN THE TESTS

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake test
```

## WORK WITH TEST REPOS

An example of how to add a test file to the bare repository `lotr.git`.

```
$ mkdir tmp; cd tmp
$ git clone ../lotr.git/ .
Cloning into '.'...
done.
$ git log
$ echo "test" > test.md

## Description

[![@dometto](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147111?u=701cfd69418a6408edb179d8e3aecca4cfe65f05&v=4&size=48)](/dometto)[dometto](https://github.com/dometto)opened [on Dec 4, 2014](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/913#issue-50977595)

There was a remote code execution vulnerability in versions of gollum < `3.1.1` (just released). Technically, the bug was in the `gollum-grit_adapter` gem dependency which was introduced in `3.1.0`, but I suspect that the same exploitable code existed in the `gollum-lib` dependency before that version (untested). Please update gollum to `3.1.1` (`gem update gollum`): that will update the dependencies. (If anyone uses `gollum-lib` without the `gollum` frontend, please `gem update gollum-lib`).

The bug exploits the fact that `grit` uses command line calls to `git grep` to implement search functionality. `git grep` takes a `-O` or `--open-files-in-pages` option that will basically pipe the results of `grep` to an arbitrary process. For example, in vulnerable versions of gollum, searching for `-Otouch /tmp/exploittest` creates the file `/tmp/exploittest` (but any arbitrary command will work, so that an attacker could setup shell access to the exploited server). However, this will only work if grep finds the string `master` (or whatever is the default branch that gollum uses) in any of the wiki's documents. See here for the vulnerable code and fix: [gollum/grit\_adapter@4520d97#diff-800aaf4e2265b3ff990b1d55a05996d6R140](https://github.com/gollum/grit_adapter/commit/4520d973c81fecfebbeacd2ef2f1849d763951c7#diff-800aaf4e2265b3ff990b1d55a05996d6R140)

Many thanks to [@joernchen](https://github.com/joernchen) for reporting this. [@sunny](https://github.com/sunny) [@bartkamphorst](https://github.com/bartkamphorst) [@jamieoliver](https://github.com/jamieoliver) please have a look and see if I didn't miss anything. One more reason to ditch grit in favour of rugged.

EDIT: fixed gollum version numbers
