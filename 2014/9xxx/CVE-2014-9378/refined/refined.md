## Obrela Advisory (OSI-1401)

**Description:**
The advisory describes four vulnerabilities in aircrack-ng <= 1.2 Beta 3.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack Overflow in `airodump-ng gps_tracker()` (CVE-2014-8321):** A stack overflow vulnerability exists that may lead to code execution and privilege escalation.
*   **Length Parameter Inconsistency in `aireplay tcp_test()` (CVE-2014-8322):** A length parameter inconsistency may lead to remote code execution.
*   **Missing Check in `buddy-ng` Data Format (CVE-2014-8323):** A missing check for data format may lead to denial of service.
*   **Missing Check in `airserv-ng net_get()` for Invalid Values (CVE-2014-8324):** A missing check for invalid values may lead to denial of service.

**Impact:**
Remote/local code execution, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

**Root cause:**
The root causes of the vulnerabilities include a stack overflow due to lack of input validation in `airodump-ng gps_tracker()`, a length parameter inconsistency in `aireplay tcp_test()`, a missing check for data format in `buddy-ng`, and a missing check for invalid values in `airserv-ng net_get()`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The `airodump-ng gps_tracker()` stack overflow could be triggered by a crafted input via the network
*   The `aireplay tcp_test()` inconsistency likely involves sending specially crafted packets
*   The `buddy-ng` vulnerability is triggered by sending data in an invalid format
*   The `airserv-ng net_get()` vulnerability is triggered by sending invalid values

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Attackers could be remote or local depending on the specific vulnerability and the context of the vulnerable code.

**Fix:**
The advisory provides links to the specific commits on GitHub that address the identified vulnerabilities.
The fix involves adding necessary input validation and handling of potential errors.

## Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201505-01)

**Description:**
This advisory details multiple vulnerabilities found in Ettercap, with the most severe allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**Affected Package:**
`net-analyzer/ettercap`

**Affected Versions:**
Versions prior to 0.8.2 are affected.

**Unaffected Versions:**
Versions equal to or greater than 0.8.2.

**Impact:**
Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a denial of service.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities through network traffic.

**CVEs Referenced:**
The advisory references multiple CVEs, including CVE-2014-9378, which is relevant to this query.

**Resolution:**
Users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Ettercap.

## Github Pull Request #610

**Description:**
This pull request addresses a potential vulnerability related to the base64 decoder in Ettercap's CVS ignore functionality.

**Root Cause:**
The base64 decoder might return -1, which could lead to `end_cred` being less than `cred`, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access in the `while(*p && p!=cred_end) p++;` loop.

**Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a potential out-of-bounds memory access due to an incorrect calculation of the end pointer for the decoded base64 data.

**Impact:**
An attacker could potentially cause a crash or other undefined behavior by sending specially crafted data containing an invalid base64 encoded string.

**Attack vector**
An attacker would need to somehow manipulate the data passed to the vulnerable base64 decoder in order to trigger the -1 return and out-of-bounds access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the data processed by the base64 decoder within the CVS ignore functionality of Ettercap.

**Fix:**
The fix addresses the potential error in the base64 decoder by checking the return value of the base64 decoder.

## Github Pull Request #604

**Description:**
This pull request addresses an issue where the return value of `dn_expand` was not checked in Ettercap's `mdns_spoof` module.

**Root Cause:**
The `dn_expand` function can return -1, which, if not checked, would lead to a stack overflow and denial of service when the returned value is used to copy the name.

**Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation, which does not handle the negative return of dn_expand function, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact:**
A denial-of-service attack can be triggered by providing input that causes `dn_expand` to fail, leading to the subsequent stack overflow.

**Attack vector**
An attacker would need to manipulate the input to `mdns_spoof` so that the `dn_expand` call would fail by returning -1.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to interact with `mdns_spoof` by providing specific input.

**Fix:**
The pull request includes a check on the return value of the dn_expand function to prevent a potential stack overflow.
