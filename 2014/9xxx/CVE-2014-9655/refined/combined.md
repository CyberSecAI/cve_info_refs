                 CVE-2015-8783 CVE-2015-8784
Debian Bug     : 808968 809021

Several vulnerabilities have been found in tiff, a Tag Image File Format
library. Multiple out-of-bounds read and write flaws could cause an
application using the tiff library to crash.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.2-6+deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Use CVE-2014-9655 for these two issues related to access of uninitialized
memory, as demonstrated by libtiff-cvs-1.tif and libtiff-cvs-2.tif.

## Synopsis

Important: libtiff security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1547)

## Topic

An update for libtiff is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2014-9655, CVE-2015-1547, CVE-2015-8784, CVE-2015-8683, CVE-2015-8665, CVE-2015-8781, CVE-2015-8782, CVE-2015-8783, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-5320)
* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, tiff2rgba). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8129, CVE-2014-8130, CVE-2014-9330, CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2015-8668, CVE-2016-3632, CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-3991)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libTIFF, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.7** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifier and bug reports referenced for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
image file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.7"

```

## Synopsis

Important: libtiff security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1546)

## Topic

An update for libtiff is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2014-9655, CVE-2015-1547, CVE-2015-8784, CVE-2015-8683, CVE-2015-8665, CVE-2015-8781, CVE-2015-8782, CVE-2015-8783, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-5320)
* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, tiff2rgba). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8129, CVE-2014-8130, CVE-2014-9330, CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2015-8668, CVE-2016-3632, CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-3991)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

Package        : tiff
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8127 CVE-2014-8128 CVE-2014-8129 CVE-2014-9330
                 CVE-2014-9655

William Robinet and Michal Zalewski discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the TIFF library and its tools, which may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed TIFF file
is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.2-6+deb7u4.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
before the initial release.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
