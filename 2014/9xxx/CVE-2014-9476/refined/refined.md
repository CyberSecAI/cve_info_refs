Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. Specifically, the code uses a flawed matching mechanism that allows a malicious site to bypass the configured `$wgCrossSiteAJAXdomains` by including an allowed domain as a prefix in its own domain name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper CORS Origin Validation:** MediaWiki used a prefix-matching strategy instead of a strict domain match for CORS validation. This allows domains like `http://en.wikipedia.org.evilsite.example/` to be incorrectly considered valid when `en.wikipedia.org` is a configured allowed domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CORS Bypass:** A malicious website could make unauthorized API calls to a vulnerable MediaWiki instance. This bypass allows the malicious site to access data or perform actions on behalf of the user, which are normally restricted by CORS policies.
- **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** If the API endpoints expose sensitive data or allow modifications, a successful exploit could result in data breaches or manipulation of wiki content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attacker hosts a malicious website with a domain crafted to bypass CORS validation by including a substring from the legitimate domain.
- **Cross-Site Request:** The malicious website sends a cross-origin request to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a website with a domain that includes a legitimate, allowed domain as a prefix.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the MediaWiki instance's allowed domains (`$wgCrossSiteAJAXdomains`).
- No authentication is needed by the attacker, only the ability to send HTTP requests from a malicious domain.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided information details how the vulnerability was fixed by implementing a stricter domain matching strategy. It also gives an example of a malicious domain and demonstrates the before and after of the vulnerability with a curl command. Additionally, it mentions that the issue affects MediaWiki versions 1.20 and above, as CORS support was not available in older versions.
