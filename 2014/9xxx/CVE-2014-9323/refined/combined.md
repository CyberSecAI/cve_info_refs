Sending malformed packet to the server (op = op\_response with any non-empty status vector data) instead expected op\_connect makes server try to write data at NULL address cause NULL pointer to status vector is passed to xdr\_status\_vector() function. This attack does not require login to server.

All Firebird versions except v3.0 are affected.

 .

 The "classic" architecture uses a new process to handle each connection

 which results in somewhat slower operation (but is said to be faster

 than "super" on local connections) yet can take advantage of multiple

 CPUs on SMP machines. This is the "traditional" architecture.

 .

 This package contains the 2.5 branch of Firebird.

 .

Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that

 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers

 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support

 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems

 under a variety of names since 1981.

 .

 The "super" architecture uses separate threads to handle each connection.

 It has its advantages (eg: is usually faster and more efficient for large

 numbers of clients) but is unable to use more that one CPU on an SMP

 system and under some circumstances a client may crash all server threads.

# USN-3929-1: Firebird vulnerabilities

2 April 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Firebird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firebird2.5](/security/cves?package=firebird2.5) - A full-featured, open source SQL database derived from Borland InterBase 6.0

## Details

It was discovered that Firebird incorrectly handled certain malformed

packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue with a specially

crafted network packet to cause Firebird to crash, resulting in a denial of

service.

([CVE-2014-9323](/security/CVE-2014-9323))

It was discovered that Firebird incorrectly handled certain UDF libraries.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-6369](/security/CVE-2017-6369))

Package        : firebird2.5
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9323
Debian Bug     : 772880

Dmitry Kovalenko discovered that the Firebird database server is prone
to a denial of service vulnerability. An unauthenticated remote attacker
could send a malformed network packet to a firebird server, which would
cause the server to crash.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2.26540.ds4-1~deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

### Security Updates for v2.1 and v2.5 series

The Firebird project has released Security Updates for the currently maintained 2.1.x and 2.5.x versions ([v2.1.7](/en/firebird-2-1-7/) and [v2.5.3 SU1](/en/firebird-2-5-3-upd1/)). These updates fix a recently discovered security vulnerability ([CORE-4630](http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-4630)) that may be used for a remote DoS attack that could be performed by unauthorised users. We recommend Firebird users to upgrade as soon as is practical.
