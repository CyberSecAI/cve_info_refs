## FAQ

For all frequently asked questions, and their answers, check the [MonsterInsights Docs](https://www.monsterinsights.com/docs/).

### Why use Google Analytics vs WordPress stats?

Native WordPress stats plugins will always slow down your website because they rely on your WordPress hosting server. Most of them do not provide accurate WordPress analytics either.

Some WordPress stats plugins use third-party servers to mitigate this issue, but they all lack powerful features that Google Analytics can offer.

Google Analytics is the #1 analytics solution in the world. It comes with all the powerful features that you can ever ask for. MonsterInsights makes it easy for you to use all advanced Google Analytics features in WordPress.

### Why choose Google Analytics by MonsterInsights vs Google Site Kit?

The MonsterInsights Google Analytics plugin is built for all types of websites, large or small, to get up and running quickly with Google Analytics and Google Analytics 4.

Beyond simply providing a Google Analytics dashboard, our plugin makes configuring advanced features as easy as point-and-click that would otherwise still require a developer to implement.

Our Google Analytics plugin also includes many features such as Google Ads tracking, Google Optimize support, form conversion reporting, goal tracking, Search Console integration, Pagespeed insights, advanced eCommerce tracking, and more.

There’s a reason over 3 million users have trusted MonsterInsights to provide Google Analytics data to their website.

### Can I use MonsterInsights together with another Google Analytics plugin?

No. You should only use one Google Analytics plugin on your WordPress site. If you use multiple Google Analytics plugins, then you will compromise your data integrity.

We recommend uninstalling other Google Analytics plugins before you install MonsterInsights.

### Why does MonsterInsights load Google Analytics in WordPress header section?

Some people believe that loading Google Analytics in WordPress header will slow down your website. That’s a myth. The Analytics code loads asynchronously which means that it does not impact your website speed at all.

MonsterInsights loads code in WordPress header because it makes sure that you have the most accurate tracking.

### Does MonsterInsights work with ad blockers?

As of version 7.18, Pro users of MontersInsights can use a locally hosted version of Google Analytics (gtag) which helps with tracking data accuracy. This version can also improve the performance of your website, compared to hosting the script on Google Analytics servers.

### Can I hide Google Analytics from tracking Administrators and Editors?

Yes. By default we do not send data to Google Analytics for logged-in WordPress administrators and editors. You can add easily [block additional user roles](//www.monsterinsights.com/docs/exclude-user-roles-from-google-analytics-tracking).

### How does MonsterInsights help with Google Analytics GDPR compliance?

MonsterInsights helps make Google Analytics GDPR compliance easier for business owners.

Our EU compliance addon allows you to:

* Anonymize IPs to Google Analytics
* Disable the Demographics and Interest Reports for Remarketing and Advertising
* Disable UserID and author name tracking
* Integrate with Cookie Notice and CookieBot plugins to collect user consent before tracking
* Integrate with Google AMP Consent Box before enable tracking
* Integrate with Google Analytics Chrome browser opt-out extension and built-in cookie opt-out system
* Offer Easy Opt Out link for Google Analytics tracking

While no single plugin can guarantee 100% GDPR compliance in WordPress, MonsterInsights goes to great lengths in helping business owners with GDPR compliance.

For more details, see: [GDPR and MonsterInsights – Everything You Need to Know](https://www.monsterinsights.com/gdpr-and-monsterinsights-everything-you-need-to-know/).

### Which eCommerce plugins are compatible with MonsterInsights Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking feature?

If you are looking to enable Google Analytics Ecommerce tracking in WordPress, then MonsterInsights is the best solution to do that.

With just 1-click, you can enable Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking for WooCommerce and see WooCommerce analytics report right inside your WordPress dashboard.

MonsterInsights Enhanced eCommerce tracking works out of the box with WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, MemberPress and 10+ other advanced integrations. These include:

* **Yoast SEO** – Easily view and analyze YoastSEO scores directly inside Google Analytics with custom dimensions.
* **Gravity Forms, Formidable Forms, Contact Forms 7** – View form events and conversion statistics.
* **LifterLMS** – Track sales data inside Google Analytics.
* **GiveWP** – Track donations as eCommerce events inside Google Analytics.
* **Restrict Content Pro** – View Google Analytics eCommerce data.
* **WordPress Comment Forms** – See which articles are driving the most engagement inside Google Analytics.
* **Generic Forms** – Easily add Google Analytics conversion tracking data to your website, no coding needed for all types of forms.

### Does MonsterInsights work on WordPress multisite?

Yes. MonsterInsights offers the most comprehensive Google Analytics solution for WordPress multi-site.

It comes with advanced permission control, sample rate control, and other options that you need to properly enable Google Analytics on WordPress multisite.

### Does MonsterInsights support Google Analytics v4 (GAv4)

Yes, we fully support Google Analytics v4 (GAv4) properties as well as GAv3 (Universal) properties. In fact, you can track your site to both at the same time using [our exclusive dual tracking feature](https://www.monsterinsights.com/introducing-google-analytics-4-dual-analytics-tracking-for-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion).
