| [Kacper Szurek](https://twitter.com/kacperszurek) helped miniBB to grow more and reported about possible SQL injection in its core. I've updated the [current version](https://www.minibb.com/download.php?file=minibb), containing the new script **bb\_func\_unsub.php**, this is one you need to update on your forums.Details of update: this codeif(isset($\_GET['code']) and preg\_match("#[a-zA-Z0-9]+#", $\_GET['code'])){should look like this:if(isset($\_GET['code']) and preg\_match("#^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$#", $\_GET['code'])){i.e. the regular expression should have **^** and **$** inside regexp.This issue might be critical, so I'd recommend to every miniBB admin to apply it ASAP.Also, in the nearest time, hopefully, I'll post an updated 3.1.1 version, covering small bugs and issues of the 3.1 release.Stay tuned! | |

| If it hads critical errors, Paul would have already done. So i can wait reassured. Previously, there was Paul always detailed information for a manual update ... and i am sure that he this will not change! | |

| The information about changes in 3.1.1 will be provided in the same manner as for any other release. Bugs are truly not critical and rather not related to security issues. | |
