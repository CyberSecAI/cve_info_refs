- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity. The Arbiter Systems 1094B GPS clock does not properly verify the authenticity of GPS signals.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The clock is vulnerable to GPS spoofing attacks due to insufficient data authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can affect the accuracy of the clock by transmitting spoofed GPS signals. This could lead to inaccurate time synchronization in systems that rely on the clock, potentially causing disruptions or malfunctions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by transmitting spoofed GPS signals using specialized radio equipment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs specialized radio equipment and knowledge of GPS signals to craft and transmit the spoofed signals. They don't need physical access to the device, as the attack is conducted remotely.
