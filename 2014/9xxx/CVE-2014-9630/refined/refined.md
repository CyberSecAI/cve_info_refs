Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9630:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes a security advisory from videolan.org that specifically mentions "A possible RTP streaming invalid memory access. (CVE-2014-9630)". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `rtp_packetize_xiph_config` function within the `modules/stream_out/rtpfmt.c` file. This function processes configuration data for RTP streaming of Ogg Vorbis files.

*   **Weakness:** The function uses a variable-length array (VLA) on the stack to store a base64 decoded configuration string extracted from the fmtp parameter. The size of this array (`len`) is determined by the length of the attacker-controlled "configuration=" string within the Ogg file. If the attacker provides a very long "configuration=" string, the VLA will attempt to allocate a large amount of memory on the stack, which can lead to a stack overflow.
    *   The vulnerable code is:
        ```c
        size_t len = end - start;   // (0)
        char b64[len + 1];		// (1)
        memcpy(b64, start, len);	// (2)
        ```
    *   `len` is derived from user provided data in the Ogg Vorbis file
    *   `b64` is allocated on the stack with the user controlled `len`
    *   `memcpy` copies `len` bytes into `b64` on the stack

*  **Impact:** By controlling the size of the configuration string, an attacker can cause a stack overflow or an out-of-bounds write, leading to a segmentation fault, denial of service, and possibly arbitrary code execution if the attacker has enough control over the data being written. Specifically, the provided stack trace shows that the crash occurs in memcpy called from `rtp_packetize_xiph_config`

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file streamed using RTP. The attacker must control the content of the Ogg Vorbis file, specifically the configuration string in the fmtp field.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Ogg Vorbis file containing the specially crafted configuration string.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to cause the victim to stream the malicious ogg file via RTP using VLC
    *   No user interaction is needed beyond opening/streaming the crafted file.

* **Additional Details:**
    *   The commit message indicates that the fix is to allocate the buffer on the heap instead of the stack and return an error if allocation fails.
    *   The original report included a test case (`input786432.ogg`) that highlights this problem.
    *   The advisory also mentions that other functions (`modules/services_discovery/sap.c`, `modules/access/ftp.c`) also contain the same problematic programming pattern, though they are not specifically related to CVE-2014-9630.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-9630 is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `rtp_packetize_xiph_config` function of VLC. The vulnerability can be triggered by streaming a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file with an overly long configuration string. This can lead to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.
