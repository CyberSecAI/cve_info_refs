Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The CCH Wolters Kluwer PFX Engagement software installs several services that run with LOCAL SYSTEM privileges.
- The executables for these services, located in `C:\PFX Engagement\`, have insecure file permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** Authenticated users have the ability to modify, replace, or alter the service executables. This is a significant weakness, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can replace the legitimate service executable with a malicious one. When the service restarts or the system is rebooted, the attacker's code will execute with LOCAL SYSTEM privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** LOCAL SYSTEM access grants the attacker complete control over the system, including access to all parts of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **File Modification:** The attacker replaces the original service executable with their own malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system.
- **File System Access:**  The attacker requires write access to the `C:\PFX Engagement\` directory to modify the executables.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both server and workstation builds of the software.
- The vendor was notified and planned to release a patch. A patch correcting the permissions was released on 12/03/2014.
- The affected services are:
    - `Pfx.Engagement.WcfServices`
    - `PFXEngDesktopService`
    - `PFXSYNPFTService`
    - `P2EWinService`
