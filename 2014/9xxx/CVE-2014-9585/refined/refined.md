Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) implementation for Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) in the Linux kernel, specifically how the vDSO memory address is selected. The address selection algorithm had a bias that made it significantly less random than intended, resulting in predictable vDSO addresses. This allows an attacker to more easily predict the location of the VDSO in memory and therefore bypass ASLR protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient ASLR entropy**: The algorithm for randomizing the vDSO location provided only 11 quality bits of entropy for its placement rather than the intended 18+, creating a limited address space for vDSO, increasing predictability.
*   **Biased addressing scheme**: The implementation had a significant probability of the vDSO being located at the very end of a Page Middle Directory (PMD).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of ASLR**: A successful exploit would allow an attacker to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism, making return-to-vdso attacks more feasible, even on systems using Position Independent Executables (PIE). This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Information Leak:** Although not the main vulnerability, the biased addressing scheme allows a local, unprivileged user to leak kernel memory addresses to user-space which are related to the vDSO.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to bypass ASLR via this vulnerability could be leveraged to create more complex exploits that enable privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack**: A local unprivileged user can leverage this vulnerability.
*   **Return-to-vdso attack**: The predictable location of vDSO allows attackers to create ROP chains using gadgets within vDSO and execute them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** An attacker needs to execute code on the target system.
*   **Basic knowledge of Linux system calls and ROP techniques:** An attacker would need the ability to craft payloads which leak memory and construct valid return-oriented programming payloads.
*   **Knowledge of system libraries and memory layout**: To successfully leverage this vulnerability, an attacker must understand the structure of the vDSO and memory layout.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Ubuntu content specifies that this vulnerability can facilitate an easier bypass of the ASLR protection mechanism.
*   The Openwall content mentions that the vulnerability is related to a patch with ID `bc3b94c31d65e761ddfe150d02932c65971b74e2`.
*   Red Hat security advisory `RHSA-2015:1778` indicates that the vulnerability is a "Low" severity flaw and provides a fix, also confirming the leakage of kernel addresses to the user space.
*   The bugzilla.suse.com content links CVE-2014-9585 to bug ID 847652, which is marked as resolved and also indicates that the fix was released for multiple versions of SLE.
