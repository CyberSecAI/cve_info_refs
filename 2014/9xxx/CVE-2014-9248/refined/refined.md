Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown for CVE-2014-9248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Zenoss application does not enforce any password complexity requirements. This means users can choose weak passwords that are easy for attackers to guess.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:** The core issue is the absence of rules that force users to create strong passwords. This vulnerability is a configuration issue rather than a coding defect, however has huge impact to security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker can easily guess weak passwords, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Once inside user accounts attackers can perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Password Guessing/Brute-Forcing:** Attackers attempt to guess or brute-force weak user passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access required:** The attacker can attempt password guessing from outside the network. They only require knowledge of the user accounts to attack.
