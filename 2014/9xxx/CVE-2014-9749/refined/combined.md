As far as we can tell, there is only one vulnerability -- it is
associated with <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c3>

Use CVE-2014-9749.

We aren't currently providing any statement about the
affected versions for this vulnerability. It is possible that
<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c7> implies
that 3.5.x wasn't ever vulnerable, but that the 3.5.x code was replaced
anyway because it had used too slow of an approach to
preventing the vulnerability.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c0)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-05-27 15:36:16 UTC  ``` With Squid 3.4.4 and digest identification  auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 3 minutes auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 1 minutes auth_param digest check_nonce_count off auth_param digest nonce_max_count 5  auth_param digest nonce_strictness off  If I change (or remove) the user's password squid never tries to re-check the login/pasword, no matter my configuration.  Worst, same problem when you entirely remove a user from your ldap directory.  Squid only test the user at start, squid or browser start, but even in this last case the users can browse with an old password, seem extremely dangerous !   Squid retains old combination login/password   Should be fixed by a recheck when the nonce is expired, or better new ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c1)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-05-28 16:44:11 UTC  ``` For record:  With this little change the problem is gone at least with none_max_count x   158 UserRequest.cc   -        auth_user->credentials(Auth::Handshake);  +        auth_user->credentials(Auth::Pending);   With none_max_count 10, after 10 requests squid makes a ldap request without any popup for the user if there is nothing new in hash -> Ok seems a good behavior, squid check the hash and if there is a change somewhere the user should fix his login/password.   For nonce_max_duration I think the problem is in auth_digest.cc   Line 542  stale = digest_user->credentials() == Auth::Handshake;  This stale Auth::Handshake seem never checked in UserRequest.cc  Line 183      case Auth::Handshake:         debugs(1, 1, HERE << "fred"); -> I'm seeing "fred" only after 10 requests with "none_max_count 10"  - without the previous change of course (I mean change Auth::Handshake to Auth::Pending) -  I hope this can help ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c2)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-05-28 16:54:45 UTC  ``` I forgot   > stale = digest_user->credentials() == Auth::Handshake; >   With stale = digest_user->credentials() == Auth::Failed;  In this case the popup appear and the browser must replay the login/password, but the problem remains a user deleted or with an old password can pass ... ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c3)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-06-11 13:10:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3058](attachment.cgi?id=3058 "Fix bug 4066") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3058&action=edit "Fix bug 4066") Fix [bug 4066](show_bug.cgi?id=4066 "REOPENED - Digest authentification never replay Ldap requests (security problem)")  This patch adds a ldap request when:  nonce_max_duration is reached nonce_max_count is reached   When a nonce is expired, squid check the HASH, makes a LDAP request, create a new nonce, without any pop-up if there is no change.  But if something is changed in LDAP (login, password), the user is denied when the nonce is expired, a pop-up appear to takes the new informations.  Tested on Squid 3.4.5 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c4)  netsystem    2014-09-15 14:47:05 UTC  ``` This bug still present in 3.4.7,and I agree that there is a safety issue. For me (squid 3.4.7) the patch fixes all my problems - users with wrong password, or worst with login disabled ... -, could it be included in 3.4.8 ? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c5)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-10-30 15:18:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c4)) > This bug still present in 3.4.7,and I agree that there is a safety issue. > For me (squid 3.4.7) the patch fixes all my problems - users with wrong > password, or worst with login disabled ... -, could it be included in 3.4.8 ?  Except the patch there is another way, you can also restart Squid each day for example at midnight or during logrotate.  Restart purge the "Ghosts in the machine", only once by day but it's better than wait a hypothetical restart of browsers (sometimes after some weeks ...) and even in this case I think that the user can use his previous account because in squid the storage hash table still the same. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c6)  Amos Jeffries    2014-12-20 10:26:01 UTC  ``` authDigestNonceIsValid() checks authDigestNonceIsStale() as one of its actions.  Does this patch work just as well if you remove the call to authDigestNonceIsStale() from the UserRequest.cc chunk ? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c7)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-12-22 10:53:45 UTC  ``` Hi Amos,  I was testing your advice and run without authDigestNonceIsStale() and I found a new bug with Squid 3.5, to be sure I started some new tests. Now, I'm speaking without any patch and exactly the same configuration for the both Squid:  Squid 3.5 makes a request for each GET/POST requests (So my patch seem unnecessary). The problem is that with many users the CPU increases and the ldap is slow, Squid becomes unusable.  I checked and this problem doesn't appear with Squid 3.4.5.  Not tested with BASIC and others, so I don't know if this is a general problem  auth_param digest check_nonce_count off auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 3600 minutes auth_param digest nonce_max_count 5000 auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 2 minutes auth_param digest nonce_strictness off   I made my test with tcpdump to port 389 and also with password change - Squid 3.5 show a pop-up immediately, squid 3.4 never (And ok with my patch when nonce is stalled/expired)  ------------  About Squid 3.4 you are right, without authDigestNonceIsStale(nonce) my patch works perfectly  (!authDigestNonceIsValid(digest_request->nonce, digest_request->nc) && (user()->credentials() != Auth::Pending )) is enough to check stalled/expired - a new nonce = Ldap request -  So It's confirm that authDigestNonceIsStale() from auth_digest.cc was also unnecessary  Thanks ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c8)  Frederic Bourgeois    2014-12-22 11:04:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c7))  > Squid 3.5 makes a request for each GET/POST requests (So my patch seem > unnecessary).

I never tried like this, but I guess this is not "dynamic" in this case  and Squid should be restarted or at least reloaded.  I think this is a normal behaviour you should see the same thing with basic auth, no ? ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c22)  Luboš Uhliarik    2016-03-11 13:21:17 UTC  ``` We are adding users and passwords to file by following function:  pw_hash=`echo -n "user:$REALM:password"|md5sum|cut -d ' ' -f 1` echo 'user:$REALM:$pw_hash' >> /etc/squid/users  It works fine.   We are checking access to proxy by following command:  curl -s --proxy-digest -x <http://localhost:3128/> -D header.log -U user:password <http://localhost/page.html> -o /dev/null  which is also working fine.  The testing workflow is following:  1. create user "nonce_max_count" with password "password" 2. try to access localhost/page.html with valid credetials, we are getting 200 OK 3. delete all users in /etc/squid/users 4. add new user "nonce_max_count" with password "new_password" 5. try to access 3 TIMES page localhost/page.html with user "nonce_max_count" and password "password", which is OLD password - still getting 200 OK, which is correct 6. now, trying to access page localhost/page.html for 4th time, user = "nonce_max_count" and password = "password", receiving again 200 OK, which is INCORRECT 7. now, try to access page localhost/page.html with user="nonce_max_count" and password = "new_password", getting 200 OK - correct behavior 8. now, try to access page with OLD credentials again (user="nonce_max_count" and password = "password"), now got 407 Proxy Authentication Required - which is also correct behavior  So until you will not try to access squid with different password, than OLD password, OLD password will be still valid. It seems to me, old password is cached somewhere.   Squid.conf is following:  debug_options ALL,0 11,2 29,9 authenticate_ttl 10 seconds auth_param digest program <DIGEST_PROGRAM> -c /etc/squid/users auth_param digest children 1 auth_param digest realm Squid_realm  auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 5 seconds auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 1 seconds auth_param digest check_nonce_count on auth_param digest nonce_max_count 4 auth_param digest nonce_strictness off  #acl manager proto cache_object #acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/32 ::1  acl secret proxy_auth REQUIRED  http_access allow secret http_access allow localhost manager http_access deny all  http_port 3128 visible_hostname localhost ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c23)  Luboš Uhliarik    2016-03-14 12:30:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Frederic Bourgeois from [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=4066#c21)) > (In rents, the nonce is just changed as expected > >  > > Yes, we were not testing LDAP, but passwords/users were stored in file. > > Anyway, after removing user or changing password, we are still able to > > access using old credentials. >  > I never tried like this, but I guess this is not "dynamic" in this case  > and Squid should be restarted or at least reloaded. >  > I think this is a normal behaviour you should see the same thing with basic > auth, no ?  Yeah, I think, with basic auth is the same problem, but Im not 100% sure now.   So do you think, this behavior is correct? I don't think, it is correct, if you remove user from auth database, and you have to restart whole Squid because of that.   Imagine situation, where users are added/removed by some script and you would have to restart squid after each removal. I think, this is security flaw. ``` |  |

3.5 had the same issue before patching. But additional
fix was required for a secondary bug found once the main issue was
patched.

The released versions I am currently aware of having this issue are:
 3.4.4 -> 3.4.11 inclusive
 3.5.0.1 -> 3.5.1 inclusive

versions older than 3.4.4 have not been investigated yet to my knowledge
.

Subject: CVE Request: squid: Nonce replay vulnerability in Digest
 authentication

Hello MITRE,

Upstream fixed a security issue in digest_authentication [1] that can
allow disabled user or users with changed password to access the squid
service with old credentials.
Upstream patch for Squid 3.4:
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~squid/squid/3.4/revision/13211>
Upstream patch for Squid 3.5:
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~squid/squid/3.5/revision/13735>

[1]: <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4066>

Can you please assign a CVE id to this issue?
