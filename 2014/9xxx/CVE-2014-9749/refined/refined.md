Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Squid handled Digest authentication nonces. Specifically, it failed to properly re-validate user credentials against the authentication backend (e.g., LDAP) when a nonce expired or when a user's password or status changed in the backend. Squid would retain old credentials, allowing access even when those credentials were no longer valid. This was due to a lack of re-checking against the user database after a nonce expired or when a user's password was changed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Nonce Replay:** The core issue is that Squid did not enforce a strict check of the nonce validity against the authentication backend. It would re-use the user credentials associated with an expired nonce.
*   **Insufficient Credential Revalidation:** Squid would not re-query the LDAP server (or other authentication backend) to verify user credentials if the nonce was still considered valid (even though the user's information changed on the backend).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with valid credentials at one point in time could maintain access to the Squid proxy even after their accounts had been disabled, passwords had been changed, or the accounts had been deleted from the authentication backend. This was true even after the nonce expired.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** This vulnerability allows a bypass of the intended access controls by allowing users with old credentials to continue accessing protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily through network requests to the Squid proxy with a valid, but possibly stale, nonce.
*   An attacker needs a valid username/password combination at some point in time.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable when Digest authentication is enabled and used by Squid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must have had valid credentials at some point in time, so they can obtain the initial valid nonce.
*   An attacker needs to use a client that supports Digest authentication and communicate with the vulnerable Squid proxy.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered in Squid 3.4.4, but was later confirmed to also exist in 3.5.x, specifically versions 3.4.4 through 3.4.11 and 3.5.0.1 through 3.5.1.
*   The fix involves changes in the code logic to ensure that credentials are re-validated by querying the authentication backend when a nonce is expired or when a certain number of requests have been made.
*   The bug report also highlights that the vulnerability exists when users and passwords are stored in files, not just with LDAP. The problem is that Squid is not checking for updates in the files and is using the cached/old password.
*   The SUSE bug report mentions that the `authenticate_ttl` configuration setting is important for testing and mitigation, as the default is 1 hour, which makes testing the vulnerability difficult.
*   The fix involves a change in `UserRequest.cc` to check if a user's credentials are in the Auth::Pending state.
*   The fix included a patch to address the "too-many helper queries" bug in 3.5 when checking for user credentials.
