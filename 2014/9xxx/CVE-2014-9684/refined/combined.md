# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0938)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix two security issues and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

Multiple flaws were found in the glance task API that could cause untracked
image data to be left in the back end. A malicious user could use these
flaws to deliberately accumulate untracked image data, and cause a denial
of service via resource exhaustion. (CVE-2014-9684, CVE-2015-1881)

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.2.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1210457)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6 runs on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.1.

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6 Release Notes (see
References section) contain the following:

* An explanation of the way in which the provided components interact to

form a working cloud computing environment.

* Technology Previews, Recommended Practices, and Known Issues.
* The channels required for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6,

including which channels need to be enabled and disabled.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

### Bug Description

When I create a new task in v2 to upload an image, it creates the image record in db, sets status to "saving" and then begins the uploading.

If the image is deleted by appropriate API call while its content is still being uploaded, an exception is raised and it is not handled in the API code. This leads to the fact that the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it.

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/common/scripts/image\_import/main.py", line 62, in \_execute

uri)

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/common/scripts/image\_import/main.py", line 95, in import\_image

new\_image = image\_repo.get(image\_id)

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/api/authorization.py", line 106, in get

image = self.image\_repo.get(image\_id)

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/domain/proxy.py", line 86, in get

return self.helper.proxy(self.base.get(item\_id))

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/api/policy.py", line 179, in get

return super(ImageRepoProxy, self).get(image\_id)

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/domain/proxy.py", line 86, in get

return self.helper.proxy(self.base.get(item\_id))

return self.helper.proxy(self.base.get(item\_id))

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/domain/proxy.py", line 86, in get

return self.helper.proxy(self.base.get(item\_id))

File "/opt/stack/glance/glance/db/\_\_init\_\_.py", line 72, in get raise exception.NotFound(msg)

NotFound: No image found with ID e2285448-a56f-45b1-9e6e-216d2b304967

This bug is very similar to [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1188532](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1188532), but it relates to task mechanism in v2.

Thanks for marking Icehouse as Incomplete, Ian. You're right there, the feature did not exist until Juno so it does not affect Icehouse. We can leave it Incomplete so that someone else does not open it up by mistake rather than deleting it.

### Bug Description

When I create a new task in v2 to upload an image, it creates the image record in db, sets status to "saving" and then begins the uploading.

If the image is deleted by appropriate API call while its content is still being uploaded, an exception is raised and it is not handled in the API code. This leads to the fact that the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it.

This bug is very similar to [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1188532](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1188532), but it relates to task mechanism in v2.

the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it.
There existed code that safely removes image files if the exception
occurs.

OSSA-2015-004: Glance import task leaks image in backend
========================================================

:Date: February 23, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2014-9684, CVE-2015-1881

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Abhishek Kekane from NTT and Mike Fedosin from Mirantis reported a
vulnerability in the Glance import task. By creating numerous images
using the task API and deleting them, an authenticated attacker may
accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in potential
resource exhaustion and denial of service. All glance setups using API
v2 are affected.

### Bug Description

Trying to delete image created using task api (import-from) image gets deleted from the database, but image data remains in the backend.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create image using task api

$ curl -i -X POST -H 'User-Agent: python-glanceclient' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress' -H 'Accept: \*/\*' -H 'X-Auth-Token: 35a9e49237b74eddbe5057eb434b3f9e' -d '{"type": "import", "input": {"import\_from": "<http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.10/ubuntu-14.10-server-i386.iso>", "import\_from\_format": "raw", "image\_properties": {"disk\_format": "raw", "container\_format": "bare", "name": "task\_image"}}}' <http://10.69.4.176:9292/v2/tasks>

2. wait until image becomes active.

3. Confirm image is in active state.

   $ glance image-list

4. Delete the image

   $ glance image-delete <image-id>

5. Verify image-list does not show deleted image

   $ glance image-list

Image gets deleted from the database but image data presents in the backend.

Problem:

Import task does not update the location of the image and it remains None even image becomes active.

Location entry is not added in the database in image\_locations table.

While deleting the image it checks if location is present for image [1][2] then only it deletes that image data from that location.

[1] v1: <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/api/v1/images.py#L1066>

[2] v2: <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/location.py#L361>

This issue is reproducible in stable/juno as well as in current master.

Note: You need to replace auth\_token in above curl command, otherwise it will raise error for authentication failure.

(Use 'keystone token-get' command to generate the new token)

So the attack scenario here would be to create/delete a lot of those and DoS the image backend by filling it up ? The half-deleted stuff not counting in any quota ?

There's a bug there indeed. Thanks for the report.

@Abhishek, may I know why you deleted the code that checks whether the image is in `saving` state or not?

I agree that code is not good - there's a race condition there - but we shouldn't remove it in this patch.

Thank you Flavio and Nikhil for review,

Also I think Import Task was added in Juno, so this issue will not affect Icehouse.

Hi,

In stable/juno if image is deleted while uploading is in progress (image is in saving state) then image\_repo.get() will raise NotFound exception which is not caught, so it will not delete image data from the backend.

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156553/1/glance/common/scripts/image_import/main.py>

The code should be like,

try:

        # NOTE: Check if the Image is not deleted after setting the data

        # before saving the active image. Here if image status is

Should I report this issue separately or it should be fixed in this same security bug.

Hi,
In stable/juno if image is deleted while uploading is in progress (image is in saving state) then image\_repo.get() will raise NotFound exception which is not caught, so it will not delete image data from the backend.
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156553/1/glance/common/scripts/image\_import/main.py
The code should be like,
try:
# NOTE: Check if the Image is not deleted after setting the data
# before saving the active image. Here if image status is
# saving, then new\_image is saved as it contains updated location,
# size, virtual\_size and checksum information and the status of
# new\_image is already set to active in set\_image\_data() call.
image = image\_repo.get(image\_id)
if image.status == 'saving':
image\_repo.save(new\_image)
return image\_id
else:
msg = \_("The Image %(image\_id)s object being created by this task "
"%(task\_id)s, is no longer in valid status for further "
"processing.") % {"image\_id": image\_id,
"task\_id": task\_id}
raise exception.Conflict(msg)
except (exception.Conflict, exception.NotFound):
with excutils.save\_and\_reraise\_exception():
if new\_image.locations:
for location in new\_image.locations:
store\_utils.delete\_image\_location\_from\_backend(
new\_image.context,
image\_id,
location)
Should I report this issue separately or it should be fixed in this same security bug.

If the patch is changing the current "expected" behavior - as in, it's fixing the bug but "unfixing" other things- then it should be done in this same bug. Otherwise, it should happen in a separate issue.

Hi,

To fix this problem completely in stable juno we should also backport <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/122427/> along with <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156553> patch.

Hum, so the cat is now out of the bag since the fix have been submitted to gerrit under the change-Id: Ie389de6538a9b98dc51c7d781b81b3ab10b83842

Though I guess this did not covered the delete during upload case mentioned in comment #13. I'm afraid we'll have to open this bug nonetheless since it is referenced in the public review, any chance to have a quick fix?

Oh and thanks for the impact description review, here is an update with proper affected versions:

Title: Glance import task leaks image in backend

Reporter: Abhishek Kekane (NTT)

Products: Glance

Affects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2

Description:

Abhishek Kekane from NTT reported a vulnerability in the Glance import task. By creating numerous images using the task API and deleting them, an authenticated attacker may leaks images data in the backend resulting in potential resources exhaustion and denial of service. All glance setups are affected.

Grammatically it would be "...may leak image data..." but I think the sentence is misleading (this is not an information leak vulnerability, it's a resource consumption vulnerability). How about "...may accumulate untracked image data..." instead?

Also, "...potential resource exhaustion..." later in the same sentence.

Otherwise Tristan's updated impact description in comment #17 looks great. Thanks!

Hi Tristan,

For the issue I have mentioned in comment #13, I have reported new private bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1422716](https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/%2Bbug/1422716)

To fix #1422716 issue, we simply need to cherrypick I4f7d1aa103f4ce7abf4026e7097b9e76c24135fa commit to stable/juno.

Many thanks Abhishek!

To sumup, the required change to fix \*all\* reported import task vulnerabilities are:

Kilo:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156493/>

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/122427/>

Juno:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156553/>

[backports of 122427]

If yes, then we should open this bug and 1422716 then move on the CVE request/publish ossa.

@fungi, thanks for the review, it makes much sense, here is the updated impact description:

Minor:

If this is specific to image import (import-from) then it only affects v2 (v1 has no import functionality).
