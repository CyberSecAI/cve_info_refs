Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap buffer overflow within the handling of PDB (Protein Data Bank) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when processing data in a PDB file, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow, potentially corrupting memory.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The memory corruption may lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts a malicious PDB file.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A simpler attack may just crash the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDB file:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted PDB file, that when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the heap buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PDB file as input to the ImageMagick software. No specific privileges needed other than ability to have program process the crafted file.

**Summary of Information:**

The information from multiple sources consistently points to a heap buffer overflow in the PDB file handling of ImageMagick. Red Hat Bugzilla also confirms it. The provided email from the oss-security mailing list includes a comprehensive list of CVEs assigned to ImageMagick vulnerabilities found during an audit, and confirms the specific issue for CVE-2014-9817, which is also mentioned on the Red Hat Bugzilla entry.
