[MITKRB5-SA-2015-001] In auth_gssapi_unwrap_data(), do not free
partial deserialization results upon failure to deserialize.  This
responsibility belongs to the callers, svctcp_getargs() and
svcudp_getargs(); doing it in the unwrap function results in freeing
the results twice.

In xdr_krb5_tl_data() and xdr_krb5_principal(), null out the pointers
we are freeing, as other XDR functions such as xdr_bytes() and
xdr_string().

- CVE-2014-5352: An authenticated attacker could cause a vulnerable
application (including kadmind) to crash or to execute arbitrary code
(bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9421: An authenticated attacker could cause kadmind or other
vulnerable server application to crash or to execute arbitrary code
(bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9422: An attacker who possess the key of a particularly named
principal (such as "kad/root") could impersonate any user to kadmind and
perform administrative actions as that user (bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9423: An attacker could attempt to glean sensitive information
from the four or eight bytes of uninitialized data output by kadmind or
other libgssrpc server application. Because MIT krb5 generally
sanitizes memory containing krb5 keys before freeing it, it is unlikely
that kadmind would leak Kerberos key information, but it is not
impossible (bnc#912002).
This non-security issue was fixed:
- Work around replay cache creation race (bnc#898439).

## Description

The auth\_gssapi\_unwrap\_data function in lib/rpc/auth\_gssapi\_misc.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 does not properly handle partial XDR deserialization, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed XDR data, as demonstrated by data sent to kadmind.

CVE ID         : CVE-2014-5352 CVE-2014-9421 CVE-2014-9422 CVE-2014-9423

Multiples vulnerabilities have been found in krb5, the MIT
implementation of Kerberos:

CVE-2014-5352

    Incorrect memory management in the libgssapi_krb5 library might
    result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-9421

    Incorrect memory management in kadmind's processing of XDR data
    might result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-9422

    Incorrect processing of two-component server principals might result
    in impersonation attacks.

CVE-2014-9423

    An information leak in the libgssrpc library.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-17.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-07 16:47:59 UTC  ``` Upstream reports that the MIT krb5 kadmind daemon incorrectly accepts authentications to two-component server principals whose first component is a left substring of "kadmin" or whose realm is a left prefix of the default realm.  An attacker who possess the key of a particularly named principal (such as "kad/root") could impersonate any user to kadmind and perform administrative actions as that user.  When kadmind receives a request using the RPCSEC_GSS authentication flavor, it queries the GSS-API security context for the server principal name and attempts to verify that it is a two-component principal name where the first component is "kadmin", the second component is not "history", and the realm is the default realm.  The validation function incorrectly uses strcmp() to compare the length-counted principal name components against null-terminated C strings for "kadmin", "history", and the default realm.  These comparisons erroneously succeed for left substrings of the of the desired C strings, so for example a first principal name component of "ka" would be accepted.  kadmind can receive authentications to any server principal entry in the Kerberos database (excluding entries with either the DISALLOW_SVR or DISALLOW_ALL_TIX flags set).  If the database contains an erroneously matching principal entry such as "ka/x", and an attacker knows the key for that entry, the attacker can conduct an escalation of privilege attack by forging tickets from any client principal name to that server principal.  By picking a client principal name with administrative privileges, the attacker could perform arbitrary administrative operations on the Kerberos database.  Suggested patch to fix this issue, as well as [CVE-2014-5352](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5352), [CVE-2014-9421](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9421) and [CVE-2014-9423](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9423) is attached to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179856](show_bug.cgi?id=1179856 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5352 krb5: gss_process_context_token() incorrectly frees context (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-07 17:03:04 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-12 15:18:43 UTC  ``` According to MIT kadmind is vulnerable in all released versions of MIT krb5.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c5)  Vincent Danen    2015-02-03 21:19:48 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2015-001.txt>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c6)  Vincent Danen    2015-02-03 21:38:36 UTC  ```  Created krb5 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1188869](show_bug.cgi?id=1188869 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5352 CVE-2014-9421 CVE-2014-9423 CVE-2014-9422 krb5: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-04 19:44:31 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/6609658db0799053fbef0d7d0aa2f1fd68ef32d8>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1179861#c8)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-02 09:16:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third
party, the Kerberos KDC.

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos libgssapi\_krb5
library processed valid context deletion tokens. An attacker able to make
an application using the GSS-API library (libgssapi) could call the
gss\_process\_context\_token() function and use this flaw to crash that
application. (CVE-2014-5352)

If kadmind were used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a remote,
authenticated attacker who has the permissions to set the password policy
could crash kadmind by attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a
password policy for a principal. (CVE-2014-5353)

It was found that the krb5\_read\_message() function of MIT Kerberos did not
correctly sanitize input, and could create invalid krb5\_data objects.
A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash a Kerberos
child process via a specially crafted request. (CVE-2014-5355)

A double-free flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled invalid
External Data Representation (XDR) data. An authenticated user could use
this flaw to crash the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind), or
other applications using Kerberos libraries, via specially crafted XDR
packets. (CVE-2014-9421)

It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind)
incorrectly accepted certain authentication requests for two-component
server principal names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a
particularly named principal (such as "kad/x") could use this flaw to
impersonate any user to kadmind, and perform administrative actions as that
user. (CVE-2014-9422)

Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting
CVE-2014-5352, CVE-2014-9421, and CVE-2014-9422. The MIT Kerberos project
acknowledges Nico Williams for assisting with the analysis of
CVE-2014-5352.

All krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

SUMMARY
=======
The MIT krb5 team has discovered four vulnerabilities affecting
kadmind. Some of these vulnerabilities may also affect server
applications which use the gssrpc library or the
gss\_process\_context\_token() function. These are implementation
vulnerabilities, not vulnerabilities in the Kerberos protocol.
CVE-2014-5352: In the MIT krb5 libgssapi\_krb5 library, after
gss\_process\_context\_token() is used to process a valid context
deletion token, the caller is left with a security context handle
containing a dangling pointer. Further uses of this handle will
result in use-after-free and double-free memory access violations.
libgssrpc server applications such as kadmind are vulnerable as they
can be instructed to call gss\_process\_context\_token().
CVE-2014-9421: If the MIT krb5 kadmind daemon receives invalid XDR
data from an authenticated user, it may perform use-after-free and
double-free memory access violations while cleaning up the partial
deserialization results. Other libgssrpc server applications may also
be vulnerable if they contain insufficiently defensive XDR functions.
CVE-2014-9422: The MIT krb5 kadmind daemon incorrectly accepts
authentications to two-component server principals whose first
component is a left substring of "kadmin" or whose realm is a left
prefix of the default realm.
CVE-2014-9423: libgssrpc applications including kadmind output four or
eight bytes of uninitialized memory to the network as part of an
unused "handle" field in replies to clients.
IMPACT
======
CVE-2014-5352: An authenticated attacker could cause a vulnerable
application (including kadmind) to crash or to execute arbitrary code.
Exploiting a double-free event to execute arbitrary code is believed
to be difficult.
CVE-2014-9421: An authenticated attacker could cause kadmind or other
vulnerable server application to crash or to execute arbitrary code.
Exploiting a double-free event to execute arbitrary code is believed
to be difficult.
CVE-2014-9422: An attacker who possess the key of a particularly named
principal (such as "kad/root") could impersonate any user to kadmind
and perform administrative actions as that user.
CVE-2014-9423: An attacker could attempt to glean sensitive
information from the four or eight bytes of uninitialized data output
by kadmind or other libgssrpc server application. Because MIT krb5
generally sanitizes memory containing krb5 keys before freeing it, it
is unlikely that kadmind would leak Kerberos key information, but it
is not impossible.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
CVE-2014-5352: kadmind in all released versions of MIT krb5 is
vulnerable. Third-party server applications using libgssrpc from all
releases of MIT krb5 are vulnerable if they enable the AUTH\_GSSAPI
authentication flavor. Third-party client and server applications
using GSS-API libraries from all releases of MIT krb5 are vulnerable
if they directly call gss\_process\_context\_token(). Such applications
are believed to be rare. Releases krb5-1.9 and prior may be less
vulnerable due to pointer validation code within the krb5 GSS-API
mechanism; applications using those releases may instead only
experience a memory leak.
CVE-2014-9421: kadmind is vulnerable in all released versions of MIT
krb5. Third-party server applications using libgssrpc are vulnerable
if they enable the AUTH\_GSSAPI authentication flavor and contain
insufficiently defensive XDR functions.
CVE-2014-9422: kadmind is vulnerable in all released versions of MIT
krb5.
CVE-2014-9423: Server software (including third-party applications)
using libgssrpc from release krb5-1.11 and later are vulnerable.

DETAILS
=======
CVE-2014-5352: gss\_process\_context\_token() incorrectly frees context
The krb5 mechanism implementation of gss\_process\_context\_token(), upon
successfully validating a deletion token, frees the security context
structure. This behavior is incorrect as the API has no way to alert
the caller that the security context was deleted. The application is
left with a valid pointer to a mechglue security context structure,
containing a dangling pointer to a freed krb5 security context
structure. Any further use of this handle will result in a
use-after-free violation and eventually a double-free when the handle
is deleted with gss\_delete\_sec\_context(). This vulnerability could
theoretically lead to the execution of malicious code, but that is
believed to be difficult.
Applications which call gss\_process\_context\_token() are believed to be
rare, but the server code in the old flavor of libgssrpc GSS-API
authentication can be induced to call gss\_process\_context\_token().
In release krb5-1.9 and earlier, the krb5 GSS mechanism contained
pointer validation code which should prevent subsequent dereferences
of the freed pointer. In these earlier releases, the vulnerability is
believed to be limited to a memory leak because
gss\_delete\_sec\_context() will not free the mechglue security context
structure.
CVE-2014-9421: kadmind doubly frees partial deserialization results
libgssrpc applications use the XDR serialization format. XDR data is
serialized, deserialized, and freed using an application function,
often generated by the rpcgen command. If an application receives
incorrectly serialized data from the client, the XDR function will
return false to report a deserialization failure, perhaps leaving
behind partial deserialization results. To avoid a memory leak, these
partial results must be freed with another invocation of the XDR
function.
In a server application, this cleanup is performed automatically by
svc\_getargs(). If the AUTH\_GSSAPI authentication flavor is used, the
cleanup is also erroneously performed by the internal unwrap function,
so the XDR function is invoked twice to clean up the partial results.
XDR functions can be defensive about being invoked twice for cleanup
by assigning pointer values to NULL after freeing them. Most XDR
functions do this, but the XDR functions within libkadm5 for principal
names and tag-length data do not. When these functions are invoked
twice by libgssrpc to clean up a value, the second invocations perform
use-after-free and double-free memory access violations. These XDR
functions are only exposed to an authenticated attacker. This
vulnerability could theoretically lead to the execution of malicious
code, but that is believed to be difficult.
Client applications are not believed to be vulnerable because
clnt\_call() and client stub functions do not free partial
deserialization results.
CVE-2014-9422: kadmind incorrectly validates server principal
When kadmind receives a request using the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication
flavor, it queries the GSS-API security context for the server
principal name and attempts to verify that it is a two-component
principal name where the first component is "kadmin", the second
component is not "history", and the realm is the default realm.
The validation function incorrectly uses strcmp() to compare the
length-counted principal name components against null-terminated C
strings for "kadmin", "history", and the default realm. These
comparisons erroneously succeed for left substrings of the of the
desired C strings, so for example a first principal name component of
"ka" would be accepted.
kadmind can receive authentications to any server principal entry in
the Kerberos database (excluding entries with either the DISALLOW\_SVR
or DISALLOW\_ALL\_TIX flags set). If the database contains an
erroneously matching principal entry such as "ka/x", and an attacker
knows the key for that entry, the attacker can conduct an escalation
of privilege attack by forging tickets from any client principal name
to that server principal. By picking a client principal name with
administrative privileges, the attacker could perform arbitrary
administrative operations on the Kerberos database.
CVE-2014-9423: libgssrpc servers output uninitialized bytes
RFC 2203 defines structures for the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor.
The rpc\_gss\_init\_res structure which conveys responses to the client
contains an opaque "handle" field which is supposed to be used to
identify the GSS-API security context. The client mirrors this field
back to the server in the "handle" field of rpc\_gss\_cred\_vers\_1\_t in
subsequent requests.
The MIT krb5 implementation of RPCSEC\_GSS does not use the handle to
find the GSS-API context, but it still provides a handle value to the
client. To provide this value, it copies the first eight or sixteen
bytes out of the GSS-API security context handle. (The number of
bytes depends on the platform's pointer size; it is eight bytes on a
32-bit platform and sixteen bytes on a 64-bit platform.)
In release krb5-1.11, an unused "interposer" field was added to the
mechglue GSS security context structure as the second pointer field.
Because this field is unused, it remains uninitialized, so the second
half of the bytes copied from the GSS security context handle are
uninitialized.
The contents of the uninitialized bytes could contain any heap data
previously freed by the application or any library it uses. The MIT
Kerberos libraries and kadmind are generally careful to zero out
sensitive data such as Kerberos key data before freeing it, but there
is nevertheless a risk of leakage of a small amount of sensitive data
to the network.

I've --with-mitkrb5 configured and run the selftest test suite with and without the proposed fix applied. In both cases the test results appear similar.

# USN-2498-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

10 February 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Kerberos.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) - MIT Kerberos Network Authentication Protocol

## Details

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly sent old keys in response to a

-randkey -keepold request. An authenticated remote attacker could use this

issue to forge tickets by leveraging administrative access. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-5351](/security/CVE-2014-5351))

It was discovered that the libgssapi\_krb5 library incorrectly processed

security context handles. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-5352](/security/CVE-2014-5352))

Patrik Kis discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled LDAP queries with

no results. An authenticated remote attacker could use this issue to cause

the KDC to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5353](/security/CVE-2014-5353))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled creating database

entries for a keyless principal when using LDAP. An authenticated remote

attacker could use this issue to cause the KDC to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5354](/security/CVE-2014-5354))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled memory when processing

XDR data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause kadmind to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-9421](/security/CVE-2014-9421))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled two-component server

principals. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform impersonation

attacks. ([CVE-2014-9422](/security/CVE-2014-9422))

It was discovered that the libgssrpc library leaked uninitialized bytes. A

remote attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2014-9423](/security/CVE-2014-9423))

### Reduce your security exposure

SUSE Security Update: Security update for krb5
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2015:0290-1
Rating: important
References: #897874 #898439 #912002
Cross-References: CVE-2014-5351 CVE-2014-5352 CVE-2014-9421
CVE-2014-9422 CVE-2014-9423
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Build System Kit 12
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
MIT kerberos krb5 was updated to fix several security issues and bugs.
Security issues fixed: CVE-2014-5351: The kadm5\_randkey\_principal\_3
function in lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_principal.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5
(aka krb5) sent old keys in a response to a -randkey -keepold request,
which allowed remote authenticated users to forge tickets by leveraging
administrative access.
CVE-2014-5352: In the MIT krb5 libgssapi\_krb5 library, after
gss\_process\_context\_token() is used to process a valid context deletion
token, the caller was left with a security context handle containing a
dangling pointer. Further uses of this handle would have resulted in
use-after-free and double-free memory access violations. libgssrpc server
applications such as kadmind were vulnerable as they can be instructed to
call gss\_process\_context\_token().
CVE-2014-9421: If the MIT krb5 kadmind daemon receives invalid XDR data
from an authenticated user, it may have performed use-after-free and
double-free memory access violations while cleaning up the partial
deserialization results. Other libgssrpc server applications might also
been vulnerable if they contain insufficiently defensive XDR functions.
CVE-2014-9422: The MIT krb5 kadmind daemon incorrectly accepted
authentications to two-component server principals whose first component
is a left substring of "kadmin" or whose realm is a left prefix of the
default realm.
CVE-2014-9423: libgssrpc applications including kadmind output four or
eight bytes of uninitialized memory to the network as part of an unused
"handle" field in replies to clients.
Bugs fixed:
- Work around replay cache creation race; (bnc#898439).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0439)

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE
links in the References section.

Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and servers
to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, the
Kerberos KDC.

## Description

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO acceptor
for continuation tokens. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw
to crash a GSSAPI-enabled server application. (CVE-2014-4344)

A buffer overflow was found in the KADM5 administration server (kadmind) when it
was used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database. A remote, authenticated
attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system
running kadmind. (CVE-2014-4345)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos libgssapi\_krb5
library processed valid context deletion tokens. An attacker able to make an
application using the GSS-API library (libgssapi) call the
gss\_process\_context\_token() function could use this flaw to crash that
application. (CVE-2014-5352)

If kadmind were used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a remote,
authenticated attacker with the permissions to set the password policy could
crash kadmind by attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a password
policy for a principal. (CVE-2014-5353)

A double-free flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled invalid External
Data Representation (XDR) data. An authenticated user could use this flaw to
crash the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind), or other applications
using Kerberos libraries, using specially crafted XDR packets. (CVE-2014-9421)

It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind) incorrectly
accepted certain authentication requests for two-component server principal
names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a particularly named
principal (such as "kad/x") could use this flaw to impersonate any user to
kadmind, and perform administrative actions as that user. (CVE-2014-9422)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos RPCSEC\_GSS
implementation (libgssrpc) handled certain requests. An attacker could send a
specially crafted request to an application using libgssrpc to disclose a
limited portion of uninitialized memory used by that application.
(CVE-2014-9423)

Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way MIT Kerberos handled certain
requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker able to inject packets into a
client or server application's GSSAPI session could use either of these flaws to
crash the application. (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)

A double-free flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO initiators. An attacker
able to spoof packets to appear as though they are from an GSSAPI acceptor could
use this flaw to crash a client application that uses MIT Kerberos.
(CVE-2014-4343)

Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting the
CVE-2014-5352, CVE-2014-9421, CVE-2014-9422, and CVE-2014-9423 issues. MIT
Kerberos project acknowledges Nico Williams for helping with the analysis of
CVE-2014-5352.

The krb5 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.12, which provides a
number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:

* Added plug-in interfaces for principal-to-username mapping and verifying

authorization to user accounts.

* When communicating with a KDC over a connected TCP or HTTPS socket, the client

gives the KDC more time to reply before it transmits the request to another
server. (BZ#1049709, BZ#1127995)

This update also fixes multiple bugs, for example:

* The Kerberos client library did not recognize certain exit statuses that the

resolver libraries could return when looking up the addresses of servers
configured in the /etc/krb5.conf file or locating Kerberos servers using DNS
service location. The library could treat non-fatal return codes as fatal
errors. Now, the library interprets the specific return codes correctly.
(BZ#1084068, BZ#1109102)

In addition, this update adds various enhancements. Among others:

* Added support for contacting KDCs and kpasswd servers through HTTPS proxies

implementing the Kerberos KDC Proxy (KKDCP) protocol. (BZ#1109919)

## Solution

All krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues and add these enhancements.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1193939#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-18 15:26:46 UTC  ``` From upstream commit [1]: """ In MIT krb5, when a server process uses the krb5_recvauth function, an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL dereference by sending a zero-byte version string, or a read beyond the end of allocated storage by sending a non-null-terminated version string. The example user-to-user server application (uuserver) is similarly vulnerable to a zero-length or non-null-terminated principal name string.  The krb5_recvauth function reads two version strings from the client using krb5_read_message(), which produces a krb5_data structure containing a length and a pointer to an octet sequence.  krb5_recvauth assumes that the data pointer is a valid C string and passes it to strcmp() to verify the versions.  If the client sends an empty octet sequence, the data pointer will be NULL and strcmp() will dereference a NULL pointer, causing the process to crash.  If the client sends a non-null-terminated octet sequence, strcmp() will read beyond the end of the allocated storage, possibly causing the process to crash.  uuserver similarly uses krb5_read_message() to read a client principal name, and then passes it to printf() and krb5_parse_name() without verifying that it is a valid C string.  The krb5_recvauth function is used by kpropd and the Kerberized versions of the BSD rlogin and rsh daemons.  These daemons are usually run out of inetd or in a mode which forks before processing incoming connections, so a process crash will generally not result in a complete denial of service. """  [1]: <https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/102bb6ebf20f9174130c85c3b052ae104e5073ec>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1193939#c2)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-03-11 15:40:59 UTC  ```  Created krb5 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1200906](show_bug.cgi?id=1200906 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-5355 krb5: unauthenticated denial of service in recvauth_common() and others [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1193939#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-03-11 16:05:58 UTC  ``` The problems in the recvauth_common() function appear to be the most interesting ones to us, as this function is called by the  krb5_recvauth() function, which in turn is used by a few services supporting krb5 auth. An unauthenticated attacker can use this to crash a server using the krb5_recvauth() function due to e.g. NULL pointer dereference (meaning that arbitrary code execution should not be possible). In the most cases the server will probably do this in a child process, which means that only the child process will crash and the overall service should remain available, which further mitigates this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1193939#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-09 05:09:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:0794 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0794.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1193939#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-11-19 05:13:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:2154 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2154.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1179857#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-07 16:39:43 UTC  ``` Upstream reports that if the MIT krb5 kadmind daemon receives invalid XDR data from an authenticated user, it may perform use-after-free and double-free memory access violations while cleaning up the partial deserialization results.  Other libgssrpc server applications may also be vulnerable if they contain insufficiently defensive XDR functions.  An authenticated attacker could cause kadmind or other vulnerable server application to crash or to execute arbitrary code. Exploiting a double-free event to execute arbitrary code is believed to be difficult.  libgssrpc applications use the XDR serialization format.  XDR data is serialized, deserialized, and freed using an application function, often generated by the rpcgen command.  If an application receives incorrectly serialized data from the client, the XDR function will return false to report a deserialization failure, perhaps leaving behind partial deserialization results.  To avoid a memory leak, these partial results must be freed with another invocation of the XDR function.  In a server application, this cleanup is performed automatically by svc_getargs().  If the AUTH_GSSAPI authentication flavor is used, the cleanup is also erroneously performed by the internal unwrap function, so the XDR function is invoked twice to clean up the partial results.  XDR functions can be defensive about being invoked twice for cleanup by assigning pointer values to NULL after freeing them.  Most XDR functions do this, but the XDR functions within libkadm5 for principal names and tag-length data do not.  When these functions are invoked twice by libgssrpc to clean up a value, the second invocations perform use-after-free and double-free memory access violations.  These XDR functions are only exposed to an authenticated attacker.  This vulnerability could theoretically lead to the execution of malicious code, but that is believed to be difficult.  Client applications are not believed to be vulnerable because clnt_call() and client stub functions do not free partial deserialization results.  Suggested patch to fix this vulnerability as well as  [CVE-2014-5352](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5352), [CVE-2014-9422](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9422) and [CVE-2014-9423](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9423) is attached to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179856](show_bug.cgi?id=1179856 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5352 krb5: gss_process_context_token() incorrectly frees context (MITKRB5-SA-2015-001)")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1179857#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-07 17:03:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1179857#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-12 15:17:42 UTC  ``` According to MIT, kadmind is vulnerable in all released versions of MIT krb5.
