{
  "CVE-2014-9803": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an issue in the ARM64 architecture's page table handling related to execute-only permissions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The original implementation of execute-only page access permissions did not prevent kernel-level reads, creating a vulnerability.",
      "The issue exists in the kernel's memory management component, specifically how it handles page table entries."
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, leading to a permanent compromise of the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application on the device."
  }
