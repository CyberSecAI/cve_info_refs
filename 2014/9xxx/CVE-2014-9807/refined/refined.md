Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a double free error in the pdb (Program Database) coder within the ImageMagick library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Double free: The same memory is freed twice which can lead to memory corruption and potentially other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash (SEGV) due to memory corruption. While not explicitly stated, double-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution in certain circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted pdb file with ImageMagick. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious pdb file to ImageMagick for processing. This could occur if an attacker can control input files to a system using ImageMagick.
