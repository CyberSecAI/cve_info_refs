# Android Security Bulletin—August 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published August 01, 2016 | Updated October 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus firmware
images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security Patch Levels of August 05, 2016 or later address these
issues. Refer to the [documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices)
to learn how to check the security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on July 06,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google service mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet,
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* Bulletin revised to correct CVE-2016-3856 to CVE-2016-2060.
* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to move more quickly to fix a subset of
  vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-08-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-08-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-08-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-08-01
    and 2016-08-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Nexus devices will receive a single OTA update with the August 05,
  2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## 2016-08-01 security patch level—Security vulnerability details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2016-08-01 patch level. There is a description of
the issue, a severity rationale, and a table with the CVE, associated
references, severity, updated Nexus devices, updated AOSP versions (where
applicable), and date reported. When available, we will link the public change
that addressed the issue to the bug ID, such as the AOSP change list. When
multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional references are linked to
numbers following the bug ID.

### Remote code execution vulnerability in Mediaserver

A remote code execution vulnerability in Mediaserver could enable an attacker
using a specially crafted file to cause memory corruption during media file and
data processing. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of
remote code execution within the context of the Mediaserver process. The
Mediaserver process has access to audio and video streams, as well as access to
privileges that third-party apps could not normally access.

The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of 2016-08-01 or later address all issues associated with
the 2016-08-01 security patch string level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-08-05
or later address all issues associated with the 2016-08-05 security patch string
level. Refer to the [help center](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705) for
instructions on how to check the security patch level. Device manufacturers that
include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-08-01] or
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-08-05].

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch level
strings?**

This bulletin has two security patch level strings in order to provide Android
partners with the flexibility to move more quickly to fix a subset of
vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. Android partners
are encouraged to fix all issues in this bulletin and use the latest security
patch level string.

Devices that use the security patch level of August 5, 2016 or newer must
include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security bulletins.

Devices that use the August 1, 2016 security patch level must include all issues
associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
reported in previous security bulletins. Devices that use August 1, 2016
security patch level may also include a subset of fixes associated with the
August 5, 2016 security patch level.

3**. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-08-01](#2016-08-01-details)
and [2016-08-05](#2016-08-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an Updated Nexus devices
column that covers the range of affected Nexus devices updated for each issue.
This column has a few options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  “All Nexus” encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
  devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices are affected by the
  issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
