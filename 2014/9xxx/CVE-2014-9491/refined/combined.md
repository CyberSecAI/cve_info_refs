Isn't rw\_exit(&sdvp->sdev\_contents); should be called before return (ENOENT);? It can induce a deadlock...

Sorry, something went wrong.

readdir seems to assume this lock is held, so, no, it you dont need to call rw\_exit(); however, at least nfs4\_readdir() has assert check, maybe its good idea to have the devzvol\_readdir() to have it as well.

Yes, my mistake. Didn't notice that lock is re-locked again later

Yes, importantly look at, for example, getdents64, you'll note that it takes an VOP rwlock before calling VOP\_READDIR, and then releases it afterwards. The fact that we're dropping the lock across some of these calls is a bit unfortunate, to be honest, but not the problem here.
