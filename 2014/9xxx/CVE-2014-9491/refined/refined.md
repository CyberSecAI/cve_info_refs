Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing null check in the `devzvol_readdir()` function within the illumos operating system. Specifically, the function uses `strchr()` to find a specific character ('/') in a string, and then dereferences the returned pointer without ensuring that `strchr()` did not return NULL (which would occur if the character is not found).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Null Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a null check after the call to `strchr()`. This can lead to dereferencing a null pointer when the character is not found in the string.
*   **Potential Kernel Panic:** The vulnerability can cause a kernel panic due to the null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a kernel panic, effectively crashing the system.
*   **System Unavailability:** The system becomes unusable until rebooted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An arbitrary user within the global zone of the illumos system can trigger the vulnerability. Non-global zones cannot directly cause this panic.
*  **File system traversal:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the filesystem in such a way that `devzvol_readdir` is called with a path that will cause the faulty logic to be executed. The exact way this occurs is not specified, but is mentioned as related to "double-tabbing through directory" in a related issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account within the global zone of an illumos system.
*   No special privileges are required beyond normal user access.
*   The attacker needs to interact with the file system in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check to ensure `strchr()` does not return NULL before attempting to dereference the pointer.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the `devzvol_readdir()` function, which is related to the ZFS file system.
*   The provided Github commit fixes the issue by introducing the null check.
*   A related issue reports this vulnerability causes a machine crash when "double-tabbing through a directory".
