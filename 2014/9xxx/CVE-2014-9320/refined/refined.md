Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control within SAP BusinessObjects. Specifically, the system fails to properly restrict access to resources when handling CORBA calls, allowing a remote user to escalate privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the lack of proper privilege checks when processing CORBA calls.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A user with low-level privileges, or even an unauthenticated guest user (if enabled), can escalate to System privileges.
*   **Insecure Token Handling:** The vulnerability allows obtaining a `SI_PLATFORM_SEARCH_SERVER_LOGON_TOKEN` via CORBA, which can then be used to perform actions with System privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** An attacker, after successfully escalating privileges, can perform any action within BusinessObjects.
*   **Data Access and Modification:** The attacker can access and modify all information stored on the SAP BusinessObjects server.
*   **Potential Business System Impact:** Depending on the configuration, the attacker could potentially connect to other business systems, leading to further damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **CORBA Calls:** The attack is performed via CORBA calls to the affected SAP BusinessObjects components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SAP BusinessObjects server.
*   **Valid User (Potentially Optional):** While a valid user account can be used, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability if the guest account is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered critical, due to the high impact and ease of exploitation.
*   A patch was released by SAP in the form of SAP Note 2039905.
*   The issue was discovered by Onapsis Research Labs.
