Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The default access control configuration in the Debian `openldap` package allowed authenticated users to modify their own attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default ACL:** The default LDAP access control rule `olcAccess: to * by self write` granted users write access to all their attributes, instead of limiting it to specific attributes like `userPassword` and `shadowLastChange`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to modify attributes like `uidNumber` and `gidNumber` allowed users to potentially impersonate other users or even gain root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users could escalate their privileges by changing their `uidNumber` to 0.
- **Impersonation:** Users could modify attributes such as Kerberos principal names, Samba SIDs, and other application-specific data, leading to impersonation attacks.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users could modify their permissions, granting them access to resources they are not authorized to use, especially if LDAP attributes are used for access control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely by any authenticated user.
- **LDAP Protocol:** The attacker would connect to the LDAP server using the LDAP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the LDAP server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the LDAP server.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
- This was a Debian-specific issue caused by the Debian maintainers' default configuration.
- The upstream OpenLDAP documentation actually suggests using a similar rule (`access to * by self write`), which could potentially lead to similar issues elsewhere, but no CVE has been assigned to the upstream issue itself.
- The fix involved removing the `by self write` rule from the default configuration and providing a warning to users with existing configurations to manually modify their access control rules during upgrades.
- Patches and fixes were created for multiple versions and releases, including squeeze-lts, wheezy, and unstable, and warnings were implemented via debconf notices.
