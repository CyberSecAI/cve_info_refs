Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-9829:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read access within the handling of SUN image files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read. The vulnerability occurs when ImageMagick processes a specially crafted SUN image file, leading to an attempt to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a potential crash or denial of service (DoS). While the information doesn't specify other impacts, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted SUN image file to ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious SUN image file to an application using ImageMagick for image processing. This could be via a web upload, email attachment, or any method where ImageMagick is used to process user-controlled image data.
