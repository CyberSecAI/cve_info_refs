Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Git handles file paths, especially on case-insensitive or case-normalizing filesystems like Windows (NTFS, FAT) and macOS (HFS+). Git's checks for disallowed paths within the `.git` directory were not adequate. Specifically, Git failed to account for:

*   **Case insensitivity:**  Paths like `.Git/config` or `.gIt/config` (with varying capitalization) were not correctly recognized as the protected `.git/config` file on case-insensitive filesystems.
*   **Unicode normalization:** Certain Unicode codepoints, like U+200C (zero-width joiner), are ignored by HFS+ when comparing file names, allowing paths such as `.g\u200cit/config` to be treated as `.git/config`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient path validation:** Git did not properly validate file paths, specifically regarding case sensitivity and Unicode normalization. This allowed an attacker to create files in the `.git` directory, which should be restricted for Git's internal metadata.
*   **Bypassing security checks:** By using variations of `.git` (case changes, unicode variations) the intended security checks were bypassed allowing for malicious content to be placed into the .git folder

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** By manipulating file paths, an attacker could overwrite the `.git/config` file. This file can contain aliases or commands that can be executed on specific events, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Overwriting repository meta-information:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to overwrite other files in the `.git` directory as well, potentially compromising the repository's integrity and security.
*   **Installation of malicious hooks:**  Malicious hooks could be installed by the attacker by placing a file in .git/hooks which would execute upon actions such as "git checkout".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Git repositories:** An attacker would need to create a malicious Git repository containing specially crafted file paths with case-insensitive or Unicode-based variations.
*   **Cloning or pulling:** Victims would be vulnerable when cloning or pulling from such a malicious repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write access to a remote repository:** The attacker needs to have write access to a repository that the victim would clone or pull from. This could be a publicly accessible repository or a private repository that the attacker has compromised.
*   **Ability to push a malicious tree:** The attacker needs to be able to push a carefully crafted Git tree to the repository which contains a malicious path.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler from the Mercurial project, highlighting the shared nature of the issue across different version control systems.
*   GitHub implemented measures to block malicious trees from being pushed to their platform. They also performed an automated scan of their hosted repositories to detect and remove any potential malicious content.
*   Patches and fixes were coordinated across various Git implementations, including libgit2, JGit, Git for Windows, and Visual Studio.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects Git clients running on Windows and macOS due to the case-insensitive nature of NTFS and HFS+ filesystems. Linux clients using case-sensitive file systems are not directly affected. However, Linux clients that mount case-insensitive shares (e.g. CIFS) are also vulnerable.
*   Multiple update sources were provided for Git including source code and binaries from the git core team, Git for Windows and Homebrew.
*   The core git team released v1.8.5.6, v1.9.5, v2.0.5, v2.1.4, and v2.2.1 to address this vulnerability.
