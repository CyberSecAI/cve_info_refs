{
  "CVE-2014-9403": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `CWebAdminMod::ChanPage()` function in `modules/webadmin.cpp` of ZNC before 1.4. This can be triggered by adding a channel with the same name as an existing channel but without the leading '#' character, leading to a use-after-delete error. An authenticated attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the `CWebAdminMod::ChanPage()` function when handling channel names without a leading '#', resulting in a use-after-delete error.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "use-after-delete"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability can cause a crash of the ZNC application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the web administration interface when adding a channel with the same name as an existing channel, but without the leading '#'.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of ZNC's web administration interface."
