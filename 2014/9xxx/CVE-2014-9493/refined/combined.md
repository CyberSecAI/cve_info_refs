OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-041
CVE: Requested
Date: December 23, 2014
Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal
Reporter: Masahito Muroi (NTT)
Products: Glance
Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:
Masahito Muroi from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By setting
a malicious image location an authenticated user can download or delete
any file on the Glance server for which the Glance process user has
access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API are affected by this flaw.

Kilo (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/141706>

Juno fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/142373>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/142788>

Notes:
 * This fix was included in the kilo-1 development milestone and will be included
   in future 2014.2.2 (juno) and 2014.1.4 (icehouse) releases.

 * The OpenStack VMT recommends revoking all credentials stored in files
   accessible by Glance as a precautionary measure.

 * A CVE has been requested for this issue, the OpenStack VMT will issue an
   errata with the correct CVE number assigned once this information is available.

### Bug Description

Updating image-location by update images API users can download any file for which glance-api has read permission.

And the file for which glance-api has write permission will be deleted when users delete the image.

For example:

When users specify '/etc/passwd' as locations value of an image user can get the file by image download.

When locations of an image is set with 'file:///path/to/glance-api.conf' the conf will be deleted when users delete the image.

How to recreate the bug:

download files:

 - set show\_multiple\_locations True in glance-api.conf

 - create a new image

 - set locations of the image's property a path you want to get such as file:///etc/passwd.

 - download the image

delete files:

 - set show\_multiple\_locations True in glance-api.conf

 - create a new image

 - set locations of the image's property a path you want to delete such as file:///path/to/glance-api.conf

 - delete the image

I found this bug in 2014.2 (742c898956d655affa7351505c8a3a5c72881eae).

What a big A RE RE!!

I checked out 742c898956d655affa7351505c8a3a5c72881eae and set show\_multiple\_locations to be True.

I checked the server startup log to be sure it was set:

With the default store set to either file or swift I got:

I haven't taken a closer look at this but my guess is that this behavior is down to filesystem store. Glance creates filesystem store for the location 'file:///' and fetches/deletes the images using this store. However, the fielsystem store isn't enforcing whether or not a given image location falls within the path where the images are usually stored. This path is indicated by 'filesystem\_store\_datadir' config option. At the following locations in filesystem store, it just looks for whether or not a given image location exists. If it exists, read/delete is performed accordingly.

<https://github.com/openstack/glance_store/blob/master/glance_store/_drivers/filesystem.py#L331>

<https://github.com/openstack/glance_store/blob/master/glance_store/_drivers/filesystem.py#L414>

For a quick fix, we can add a check to ensure that image location MUST fall under the path indicated by 'filesystem\_store\_datadir'. Only then a read/delete operation may be perfomed.

This assessment maybe completely off, please do correct me in that case. I shall take a closer look at this soon-ish.

I use v2 like Stuart mentioned in #4.

I realized that user also can get http responses from openstack or no openstack systems in DC. If operators have web based utility tools which don't authorize requests in the DC user can download the info. OpenStack API which require a token with requests don't matter this since glance checks first reachabilities for the location in the location-add.

Hi Stuart, Hemanth,

Thanks for your analysis.

As an alternative solution regarding to changing store drive that Hemanth proposed above, I think we could make a similar limitation/check on image location update api like what we did in v1 [0] as well, to prevent user use patch api to handle file and swift location? A unique benefit of the way is that, IMO, it could make v2 api be consistent with v1 on this kind of request from client's perspective.

I agree with Zhi that a good, quick and probably most importantly \*backportable\* solution would be to add a similar check in v2 as we have in v1.

A future follow-up patch should a a proper verification process in the store code and make the server side use it.

Yes, I was also thinking adding the v1 style limitation to v2 is probably a good idea.

I'd also like to see the set and get location policies default to admin only -- what do others think about that? (IMHO playing directly with the locations should be something that power users 'opt in' to be able to do.)

Hi Stuart, I'm thinking if that way/rule could be overkill for the image owner? For example, probably end user prepared/had an image content from an existing storage, then, IMO it's sensible to allow end user adds that location to own image. Am I miss any ting?

> IMO it's sensible to allow end user adds that location to own image.

It is currently an operator decision. Some operators will want to allow this and others will not. The question is: which is a better default for the set\_image\_location policy? My feeling is that a lot of new operators may not necessarily understand the finer details of allowing a user to set image locations directly. When it is enabled, there are far fewer assumptions that an operator can make about the state of the glance system, and the image data paths, which complicates administration.

It also increases the attack surface a lot (eg this and other bugs). I personally would like turning on the ability to set locations be an explicit decision by the operator -- that gives them a chance to consciously weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, and to 'nudge' them to leave it disabled unless they really need it.

Changing the set/get location policies default to admin only is not a bad idea, but that's a different patch (master only).

For the (backportable) vulnerability fix, we ideally need something which would close the hole without chaging behavior for "normal" users. Are there valid use cases for specifying a file:// location ? If not, I think having a v1-style check in v2 is the simplest solution.

For the direction/idea of fixing driver, like Hemanth mentioned above, something in my mind is that: Totally I think it's a worth thing to get due to I think we'd better don't suppose glance\_store lib are used by glance only, other project, e.g. Nova, probably could leverage it as well. I'm a little worried if that way could be a blocker for migration or upgrade operation on glance however, if we always checks if given image location are lived in configured storage directory(s) at [0], we could prevent the problem happen, but if operator changed option of glance-api with a new storage folder and want to keep existing image works (the existing locations in db are pointing to original path), this approach will cause all location of existing images to be invalid, and limits operator to do that kind of migration/upgrade operation - he/she can't change storage directory(s) option even there's an available image, unless updating db at the same time, but I think it's a little heavy.

Since this was unfortunately disclosed too early, posting a mitigation solution would be good. My understaning is that setting the set\_image\_location policy to admin-only is a way to work around the issue temporarily. Glance core, could you confirm ?

Draft impact description -

Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal

Reporter: Masahito Muroi (NTT)

Products: Glance

Versions: Versions 2012.2 up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Masahito Muroi from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance v2 API. By setting a malicious image location an authenticated user can download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the glance-api process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance v2 API are affected by this flaw.

Note:

A potential mitigation strategy available for operators is to change the glance policy to restrict access to administrators for get\_image\_location, set\_image\_location, and delete\_image\_location.

The setting of policy to admin only makes sense.

However, there is a risk of backward incompatibility if a existing deployment runs with this assumption (and they knowingly change the policy in adherence to the security issue). Given the nature of the risk it (admin only policy) seems like a decent trade-off until a cleaner solution is proposed. We'd try to get the better fix sooner in kilo.

Thanks!

@Grant, the affected version may be too broad, the bug might have been introduced by <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35134/> which was not merged before 2013.2. And as we don't support Havana anymore I think the version line should be:

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Also while the leak seems to happens on the glance-api server, shouldn't we also consider registry and storage node to be likely affected as well ?

I can confirm that the issue can be reproduced on a fully up-to-date Icehouse installation with the default configuration (both v1 and v2 API enabled). The only prerequisites to reproduce it are a recent version of python-glanceclient (newer than 0.14.0 due to [lp:1367326](/bugs/1367326)) and the patch mentioned in #6.

As a sidenote, after patching glance (or the policy) all credentials stored in files accessible by glance (especially those related to the operation of glance itself) should be revoked as a precautionary measure.

About Havana:

I think havana is not affected:

Here Icehouse fix: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142788/3/glance/api/v1/images.py>

And this is havana code:

def \_validate\_source(source, req):

        if source:

            for scheme in ['s3', 'swift', 'http', 'rbd', 'sheepdog', 'cinder']:

                if source.lower().startswith(scheme):

                    return source

            msg = \_("External sourcing not supported for store %s") % source

            raise HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg, bla-bla-bla

Basically, havana will not accept anything except listed ('s3', 'swift', 'http', 'rbd', 'sheepdog', 'cinder'), and will rejects schemes 'file' and 'swift+config'.

The key point for this issue is about the location validation missing in image v2 patch api, v1 stuff is ok for all havana, icehouse, juno releases.

Base on code, technically I'm sure stable/havana has this defect as well. ref <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/havana-eol/glance/api/v2/images.py#L154> .

I merged this fix of icehouse then found one issue, I can still download file when use filesystem://, while I cannot delete file. When use file:// it looks working fine.

Looks as though the fix is incomplete. Using the filesystem URI scheme will still hit the same code path.

I missed to block 'filesystem' due to file store support two schemas 'file' and 'filesystem', so the original solution is still correct, it just need to add 'filesystem' to disallowance list. Thanks Grant to add it.

I have treied with several sequences of actions.

First i set show\_multiple\_locations = True

in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf

and restarted glance by: glance-control all restart

Flow 1

1) Created small image via Horizon GUI.

2) glance --os-image-api-version 2 location-add --url file:///etc/fstab f44eb9f7-2045-4118-b09b-fdfb71d58b2a

The administrator has disabled API access to image locations (HTTP 400)

OK

Flow 2

1) Created small image via GUI.

2) Added Metadata via Horizon url=file:///etc/fstab

3) glance image-download --file ~/small.iso f44eb9f7-2045-4118-b09b-fdfb71d58b2a

4) Checked contents of file - OK.

Flow 3

1) glance image-create --disk-format raw --container-format bare

2) glance --os-image-api-version 2 location-add --url file:///etc/mtab 22f3e03e-1431-4f31-a1c6-0cfe52ae3c43

The administrator has disabled API access to image locations (HTTP 400)

OK

Flow 4

1) glance image-create --disk-format raw --container-format bare

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174474#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-15 22:02:43 UTC  ``` Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal Reporter: Masahito Muroi (NTT) Products: Glance Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1  Description: Masahito Muroi from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By setting a malicious image location an authenticated user can download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the Glance process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance V2 API are affected by this flaw.  Note: A potential mitigation strategy available for operators is to change the glance policy to restrict access to administrators for get_image_location, set_image_location, and delete_image_location. An example patch to be applied to /etc/glance/policy.json is attached.

### Bug Description

Updating image-location by update images API users can download any file for which glance-api has read permission.

And the file for which glance-api has write permission will be deleted when users delete the image.

For example:

When users specify '/etc/passwd' as locations value of an image user can get the file by image download.

When locations of an image is set with 'file:///path/to/glance-api.conf' the conf will be deleted when users delete the image.

How to recreate the bug:

download files:

 - set show\_multiple\_locations True in glance-api.conf

 - create a new image

 - set locations of the image's property a path you want to get such as file:///etc/passwd.

 - download the image

delete files:

 - set show\_multiple\_locations True in glance-api.conf

 - create a new image

 - set locations of the image's property a path you want to delete such as file:///path/to/glance-api.conf

 - delete the image

I found this bug in 2014.2 (742c898956d655affa7351505c8a3a5c72881eae).

What a big A RE RE!!

I checked out 742c898956d655affa7351505c8a3a5c72881eae and set show\_multiple\_locations to be True.

I checked the server startup log to be sure it was set:

2014-12-10 16:37:23.803 6847 DEBUG glance.common.config [-] show\_multiple\_locations = True log\_opt\_values /mnt/ubuntu/git/glance-juno-stable/glance/.tox/py27/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/oslo/config/cfg.py:1992

With the default store set to either file or swift I got:

I haven't taken a closer look at this but my guess is that this behavior is down to filesystem store. Glance creates filesystem store for the location 'file:///' and fetches/deletes the images using this store. However, the fielsystem store isn't enforcing whether or not a given image location falls within the path where the images are usually stored. This path is indicated by 'filesystem\_store\_datadir' config option. At the following locations in filesystem store, it just looks for whether or not a given image location exists. If it exists, read/delete is performed accordingly.

<https://github.com/openstack/glance_store/blob/master/glance_store/_drivers/filesystem.py#L331>

<https://github.com/openstack/glance_store/blob/master/glance_store/_drivers/filesystem.py#L414>

For a quick fix, we can add a check to ensure that image location MUST fall under the path indicated by 'filesystem\_store\_datadir'. Only then a read/delete operation may be perfomed.

This assessment maybe completely off, please do correct me in that case. I shall take a closer look at this soon-ish.

I use v2 like Stuart mentioned in #4.

I realized that user also can get http responses from openstack or no openstack systems in DC. If operators have web based utility tools which don't authorize requests in the DC user can download the info. OpenStack API which require a token with requests don't matter this since glance checks first reachabilities for the location in the location-add.

Hi Stuart, Hemanth,

Thanks for your analysis.

As an alternative solution regarding to changing store drive that Hemanth proposed above, I think we could make a similar limitation/check on image location update api like what we did in v1 [0] as well, to prevent user use patch api to handle file and swift location? A unique benefit of the way is that, IMO, it could make v2 api be consistent with v1 on this kind of request from client's perspective.

I agree with Zhi that a good, quick and probably most importantly \*backportable\* solution would be to add a similar check in v2 as we have in v1.

A future follow-up patch should a a proper verification process in the store code and make the server side use it.

Yes, I was also thinking adding the v1 style limitation to v2 is probably a good idea.

I'd also like to see the set and get location policies default to admin only -- what do others think about that? (IMHO playing directly with the locations should be something that power users 'opt in' to be able to do.)

Hi Stuart, I'm thinking if that way/rule could be overkill for the image owner? For example, probably end user prepared/had an image content from an existing storage, then, IMO it's sensible to allow end user adds that location to own image. Am I miss any ting?

> IMO it's sensible to allow end user adds that location to own image.

It is currently an operator decision. Some operators will want to allow this and others will not. The question is: which is a better default for the set\_image\_location policy? My feeling is that a lot of new operators may not necessarily understand the finer details of allowing a user to set image locations directly. When it is enabled, there are far fewer assumptions that an operator can make about the state of the glance system, and the image data paths, which complicates administration.

It also increases the attack surface a lot (eg this and other bugs). I personally would like turning on the ability to set locations be an explicit decision by the operator -- that gives them a chance to consciously weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, and to 'nudge' them to leave it disabled unless they really need it.

Changing the set/get location policies default to admin only is not a bad idea, but that's a different patch (master only).

For the (backportable) vulnerability fix, we ideally need something which would close the hole without chaging behavior for "normal" users. Are there valid use cases for specifying a file:// location ? If not, I think having a v1-style check in v2 is the simplest solution.

For the direction/idea of fixing driver, like Hemanth mentioned above, something in my mind is that: Totally I think it's a worth thing to get due to I think we'd better don't suppose glance\_store lib are used by glance only, other project, e.g. Nova, probably could leverage it as well. I'm a little worried if that way could be a blocker for migration or upgrade operation on glance however, if we always checks if given image location are lived in configured storage directory(s) at [0], we could prevent the problem happen, but if operator changed option of glance-api with a new storage folder and want to keep existing image works (the existing locations in db are pointing to original path), this approach will cause all location of existing images to be invalid, and limits operator to do that kind of migration/upgrade operation - he/she can't change storage directory(s) option even there's an available image, unless updating db at the same time, but I think it's a little heavy.

Since this was unfortunately disclosed too early, posting a mitigation solution would be good. My understaning is that setting the set\_image\_location policy to admin-only is a way to work around the issue temporarily. Glance core, could you confirm ?

Draft impact description -

Title: Glance v2 API unrestricted path traversal

Reporter: Masahito Muroi (NTT)

Products: Glance

Versions: Versions 2012.2 up to 2014.2.1

Description:

Masahito Muroi from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance v2 API. By setting a malicious image location an authenticated user can download or delete any file on the Glance server for which the glance-api process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance v2 API are affected by this flaw.

Note:

A potential mitigation strategy available for operators is to change the glance policy to restrict access to administrators for get\_image\_location, set\_image\_location, and delete\_image\_location.

The setting of policy to admin only makes sense.

However, there is a risk of backward incompatibility if a existing deployment runs with this assumption (and they knowingly change the policy in adherence to the security issue). Given the nature of the risk it (admin only policy) seems like a decent trade-off until a cleaner solution is proposed. We'd try to get the better fix sooner in kilo.

Thanks!

@Grant, the affected version may be too broad, the bug might have been introduced by <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/35134/> which was not merged before 2013.2. And as we don't support Havana anymore I think the version line should be:

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Also while the leak seems to happens on the glance-api server, shouldn't we also consider registry and storage node to be likely affected as well ?

I can confirm that the issue can be reproduced on a fully up-to-date Icehouse installation with the default configuration (both v1 and v2 API enabled). The only prerequisites to reproduce it are a recent version of python-glanceclient (newer than 0.14.0 due to [lp:1367326](/bugs/1367326)) and the patch mentioned in #6.

As a sidenote, after patching glance (or the policy) all credentials stored in files accessible by glance (especially those related to the operation of glance itself) should be revoked as a precautionary measure.

About Havana:

I think havana is not affected:

Here Icehouse fix: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142788/3/glance/api/v1/images.py>

And this is havana code:

def \_validate\_source(source, req):

        if source:

            for scheme in ['s3', 'swift', 'http', 'rbd', 'sheepdog', 'cinder']:

                if source.lower().startswith(scheme):

                    return source

            msg = \_("External sourcing not supported for store %s") % source

            raise HTTPBadRequest(explanation=msg, bla-bla-bla

Basically, havana will not accept anything except listed ('s3', 'swift', 'http', 'rbd', 'sheepdog', 'cinder'), and will rejects schemes 'file' and 'swift+config'.

The key point for this issue is about the location validation missing in image v2 patch api, v1 stuff is ok for all havana, icehouse, juno releases.

Base on code, technically I'm sure stable/havana has this defect as well. ref <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/havana-eol/glance/api/v2/images.py#L154> .

I merged this fix of icehouse then found one issue, I can still download file when use filesystem://, while I cannot delete file. When use file:// it looks working fine.

Looks as though the fix is incomplete. Using the filesystem URI scheme will still hit the same code path.

I missed to block 'filesystem' due to file store support two schemas 'file' and 'filesystem', so the original solution is still correct, it just need to add 'filesystem' to disallowance list. Thanks Grant to add it.

I have treied with several sequences of actions.

First i set show\_multiple\_locations = True

in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf

and restarted glance by: glance-control all restart

Flow 1

1) Created small image via Horizon GUI.

2) glance --os-image-api-version 2 location-add --url file:///etc/fstab f44eb9f7-2045-4118-b09b-fdfb71d58b2a

The administrator has disabled API access to image locations (HTTP 400)

OK

Flow 2

1) Created small image via GUI.

2) Added Metadata via Horizon url=file:///etc/fstab

3) glance image-download --file ~/small.iso f44eb9f7-2045-4118-b09b-fdfb71d58b2a

4) Checked contents of file - OK.

Flow 3

1) glance image-create --disk-format raw --container-format bare

2) glance --os-image-api-version 2 location-add --url file:///etc/mtab 22f3e03e-1431-4f31-a1c6-0cfe52ae3c43

The administrator has disabled API access to image locations (HTTP 400)

OK

Flow 4

1) glance image-create --disk-format raw --container-format bare

2) glance image-update --location filesystem:///etc/passwd 3b3a5f9d-690b-42d7-bfbf-aef5d82d73d2

Almost good, but CLI output could be like in Flow 1 and 3.

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-glance security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0246)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

It was discovered that an authenticated user could use a path traversal
flaw in glance to download or delete any file on the glance server that is
accessible to the glance process user. Note that only setups using the
OpenStack Image V2 API were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2014-9493)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running glance services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
