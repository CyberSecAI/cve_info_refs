- Root cause of vulnerability: The Glance v2 API did not properly validate image locations, allowing authenticated users to specify arbitrary file paths.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unrestricted path traversal, improper input validation.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could download arbitrary files from the Glance server if the `glance-api` process had read permissions. Additionally, they could delete arbitrary files if the `glance-api` process had write permissions. This could lead to information disclosure, service disruption, or complete system compromise.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by setting a malicious image location through the Glance v2 API (specifically the `location-add` operation), then downloading or deleting the image.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Glance v2 API.
