Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9764:

**CVE-2014-9764**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in imlib2's GIF loader. Specifically, a crafted GIF file can trigger a segmentation fault.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of GIF files leading to a crash.
    *   Out-of-bounds access when processing specific crafted GIF data.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by enticing a user to open a specially crafted GIF file using an application linked against `imlib2`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A network-based attack vector is the primary means of exploitation, as the attacker sends a malicious GIF file to a victim system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to deliver a crafted GIF file to a user.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
* The Suse information lists a CVSS v2 score of 5, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P. This aligns with the CVE description of a network-based attack with low complexity, no authentication, and partial availability impact (Denial of Service).
* Suse indicates the issue is resolved.
* Gentoo security advisory states that a remote attacker could trigger execution of arbitrary code (or a denial of service) using a crafted image, but the CVE description for CVE-2014-9764 does not indicate arbitrary code execution, but rather just a denial of service.
* Debian security advisory DSA-3537-1 describes the vulnerability as "A segmentation fault could occur when opening GIFs with feh."

The provided content confirms the vulnerability is a denial of service due to a crafted GIF file, and that a patch is available.

**Summary of relevant information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service via crafted GIF file.
*   **Affected Software:** imlib2 before 1.4.7
*   **Impact:** Application crash (segmentation fault)
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, crafted GIF file
*   **Severity:** Moderate to Important
