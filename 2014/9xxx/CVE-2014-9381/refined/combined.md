| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-12-17 08:42:30 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  The following vulnerabilities have been reported in ettercap:  Twelve vulnerabilities exist on ettercap-ng which allow remote denial of service and possible remote code execution. Specifically, the following vulnerabilities were identified:  - A Length Parameter Inconsistency at ettercap 8.0 dissector_postgresql() which may lead to remote code execution or denial of service.  - An arbitary write of zero in to any location at ettercap 8.0 dissector_postgresql  - A negative index/underflow at ettercap 8.1 dissector_dhcp() which may lead to denial of service  - A heap overflow at ettercap 8.1 nbns_spoof() plugin which may lead to remote code execution or denial of service.  - An unchecked return value at ettercap 8.1 mdns_spoof() plugin which may lead to remote denial of service.  - A negative index/underflow at ettercap 8.1 dissector_TN3270  - A negative index/underflow at ettercap 8.1 dissector_gg  - A negative index/underflow at ettercap 8.1 get_decode_len()  - An incorrect cast at ettercap 8.1 dissector_radius which may lead to remote code execution or denial of service.  - A buffer over-read at ettercap 8.1 dissector_cvs which may lead to denial of service  - A signedness error at ettercap 8.1 dissector_cvs  - An unchecked return value at ettercap 8.1 dissector_imap which may lead to denial of service  The following CVEs have been assigned:  CVE-2014-6395: Length Parameter Inconsistency CVE-2014-6396: Arbitary write CVE-2014-9376: Negative index/underflow CVE-2014-9377: Heap overflow CVE-2014-9378: Unchecked return value CVE-2014-9379: Incorrect cast CVE-2014-9380: Buffer over-read CVE-2014-9381: Signedness error  The patches are linked to in the following advisory:  <https://www.obrela.com/home/security-labs/advisories/osi-advisory-osi-1402/>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2015-01-04 03:15:32 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-9381 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9381>):   Integer signedness error in the dissector_cvs function in   dissectors/ec_cvs.c in Ettercap 8.1 allows remote attackers to cause a   denial of service (crash) via a crafted password, which triggers a large   memory allocation.  CVE-2014-9380 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9380>):   The dissector_cvs function in dissectors/ec_cvs.c in Ettercap 8.1 allows   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a   packet containing only a CVS_LOGIN signature.  CVE-2014-9379 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9379>):   The radius_get_attribute function in dissectors/ec_radius.c in Ettercap 8.1   performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial   of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified   vectors, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.  CVE-2014-9378 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9378>):   Ettercap 8.1 does not validate certain return values, which allows remote   attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary   code via a crafted (1) name to the parse_line function in   mdns_spoof/mdns_spoof.c or (2) base64 encoded password to the dissector_imap   function in dissectors/ec_imap.c.  CVE-2014-9377 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9377>):   Heap-based buffer overflow in the nbns_spoof function in   plug-ins/nbns_spoof/nbns_spoof.c in Ettercap 8.1 allows remote attackers to   cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large   netbios packet.  CVE-2014-9376 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-9376>):   Integer underflow in Ettercap 8.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial   of service (out-of-bounds write) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a   small (1) size variable value in the dissector_dhcp function in   dissectors/ec_dhcp.c, (2) length value to the dissector_gg function in   dissectors/ec_gg.c, or (3) string length to the get_decode_len function in   ec_utils.c or a request without a (4) username or (5) password to the   dissector_TN3270 function in dissectors/ec_TN3270.c.  CVE-2014-6396 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-6396>):   The dissector_postgresql function in dissectors/ec_postgresql.c in Ettercap   before 8.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly   execute arbitrary code via a crafted password length, which triggers a 0   character to be written to an arbitrary memory location.  CVE-2014-6395 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-6395>):   Heap-based buffer overflow in the dissector_postgresql function in   dissectors/ec_postgresql.c in Ettercap before 8.1 allows remote attackers to   cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted   password length value that is inconsistent with the actual length of the   password. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-14 17:22:50 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =net-analyzer/ettercap-0.8.2 Target keywords : "alpha amd64 arm ppc ppc64 sparc x86" ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Andreas Schürch   gentoo-dev  2015-03-17 09:46:05 UTC  ``` x86 done ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-18 08:32:52 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2015-03-24 20:16:04 UTC  ``` arm stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-26 11:22:39 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-26 11:29:47 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-30 09:50:57 UTC  ``` sparc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-03-30 10:03:41 UTC  ``` alpha stable.

### @NickSampanis **[NickSampanis](/NickSampanis)** commented [Oct 17, 2014](#issue-46134724)

the characters of pointer \*p is used as an index to the array cvs\_shifts. We control these characters as password and while it seems thats a valid action because cvs\_shifts has size of 256, it isn't. The reason is that p is a signed pointer so when p[i](which is say 0xff) will be converted to unsigned size\_t as 0xffffffff and not as 255

Sorry, something went wrong.
