Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9691:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a sensitive information leak. Specifically, the web UI of some Huawei server products displays the session IDs of all online users on the "Online Users" page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of active session IDs, which should be kept confidential.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system does not sufficiently protect session IDs, allowing any logged-in user to view all other active session IDs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Identity Forgery:** Attackers can use leaked session IDs to impersonate other users and gain unauthorized access to the system with the forged identities of legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web UI of the affected server product.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the affected system to log in to the web UI.
*   **Web UI Access:** The attacker needs access to the web UI of the server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable page:** The attacker has to know that session IDs are exposed in the "Online Users" page.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes a vulnerability in some Huawei server products where session IDs of online users are exposed on the web UI. An attacker with valid credentials could leverage this information to impersonate other users and gain access to the system with forged identities.
