{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The /api/definitions endpoint in RabbitMQ did not properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the 'download' query string parameter. It failed to strip Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response Splitting"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response. This could potentially allow them to perform actions such as modifying the content of the response, setting cookies, or injecting other headers that could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities or gain access to secure data.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL to the `/api/definitions` endpoint, including a crafted `download` query string parameter containing CR and LF characters followed by the desired headers.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable RabbitMQ instance. They don't need to be authenticated."
