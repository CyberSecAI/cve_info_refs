```
{
  "CVE-2014-9761": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nan`, `nanf`, and `nanl` functions in glibc allocate a buffer on the stack based on the length of the input string without any limit. This can cause a stack overflow if a long enough string is provided as an argument.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unbounded stack allocation",
      "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of the stack overflow vulnerability can lead to a denial of service through application crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a long string to nan, nanf or nanl functions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a large input string to one of the vulnerable functions."
  }
