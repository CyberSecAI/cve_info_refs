 edited August 2014   in [Releases](https://open.vanillaforums.com/categories/blog)

Announcing the availability of 2.1.1, a security & bug fix release for 2.1.

It is imperative all 2.1 forums *upgrade immediately*.

**[DOWNLOAD HERE](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.1.1 "DOWNLOAD HERE")**

* HtmLawed was upgraded to close an XSS vector (thanks to Psych0tr1a for responsibly disclosing this to us & to HtmLawed for a fast patch in response).
* Multiple XSS exploits were fixed (thanks to [@x00](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/x00) for responsibly disclosing and both he and [@businessdad](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/businessdad) for assistance in making our patches as bulletproof as possible).
* Fixed a Twitter SSL bug (thanks [@Adrian](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Adrian) for the patch).
* Fixed a missing permission check in the sorting utility (thanks [@R\_J](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/R_J) for the patch).
* cleditor was patched to fix a crippling IE11 bug.
* Profile Extender was upgraded and a security flaw in it was fixed.
* Fixed a bug in Announcing while starting a discussion.
* Corrected the default theme README.
* Backported GDN\_UserAuthenticationProvider.IsDefault so the latest version of jsConnect will work with 2.1.1.
* Fixes a theme screenshot bug (thanks [@hgtonight‌](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/hgtonight%E2%80%8C) for the patch).

As you can see, some extremely critical fixes are included. The only feature addition is those added to the Profile Extender addon as a result of getting backported from 2.2 (master) branch.

**[Diff of 2.1.1 against 2.1 gold](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/compare/2dab6d63a7caecce35d5ac958b53696d2cf92c47...217901796812bb3bbff6c2a76e6d02999a2b6346).** (32 files changed, so I don't recommend a selective upgrade on this one.)

2.0.18.11 has the same XSS issues and its patch will be released this weekend **[is available here as 2.0.18.12](http://vanillaforums.org/discussion/27541/vanilla-2-0-18-12-security-release-for-old-2-0-18-installs#latest)**.

  Thanks for the update [@Linc](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Linc). Looking forward to the patch for 2.0.x. I know it will be a pain, but I will need to do a `diff` before updating, as I had to change a core model to fix some performance issues (which will probably be unaffected, but better safe than sorry).

  [@businessdad](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/businessdad) The 2.0 patch will be much more limited since it will selectively be targetting the XSS.

  How does one upgrade 2.1 already installed? Is there like an autoupdate feature or do you have to download the zip and upload via FTP?

  [@MichaelCS](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/MichaelCS) The upgrade instructions are in the README file. Yes, the upshot is: upload the new files, replacing the existing ones. We do not have an auto-update feature.

  For those using Emotify plugin, if you have custom images/settings, make sure you back up before upgrading, as the files are over-written.

  If it wasn't obvious, anyone using the master/2.2 branch needs to upgrade to **2.2.15.5** (current HEAD) as well.

  Hello all,

  I can't install the new archive (08.02.14 - 2.1.1) either on local or on distant server. On both, page does not open (it stays blank) and I can't start the setup process. Sorry if I didn't post in the right category.

  Any thoughts?

  [@blizeH](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/blizeH) It is, but please follow the 2.0 -> 2.1 upgrade instructions that has an extra step or two (including deleting an old file). You may need to run /utility/update more than once.

  I recommend testing your theme & plugins on a separate 2.1 test install first to make sure it's compatible unless you've already verified they all work. There were a few backwards-compatibility breaks.

If you are on 2.0.18 (or any 2.0.\* release) and have not yet made the upgrade to 2.1, this would be a great time to get moving! If you're still not ready leave our glorious 2.0 days behind, fear not, the latest security patch is here.

**[DOWNLOAD 2.0.18.13 HERE](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.0.18.13)**

The 2.0 code base is only being given important security patches, and only until the end of 2014.

In this release, we close recently discovered XSS exploits:

* HtmLawed is upgraded and its filtering tightened (thanks [@x00](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/x00) & Psych0tr1a)
* parseJSON() is substituted for eval() in 2 places
* We refactor the definitions list into Javascript instead of using the DOM (thanks [@businessdad)](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/businessdad%29)

**[Complete diff here](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/compare/2c145c2849b536439b7f6fa825e5309ba5e58715...22576336efbc088dae8956ea68eb6c109fcdbc2a "Complete diff here")**.

  We have released **[2.0.18.13](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.0.18.13)** to address an HTML parsing glitch introduced by the new version of HtmLawed. h/t to [@x00](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/x00) for the bug report & fix.

  Updating the OP from 2.0.18.12 to 2.0.18.13 rather than starting a second release discussion.

  You can selectively upgrade from .12 to .13 by simply replacing `/plugins/HtmLawed/class.htmlawed.plugin.php` and, of course, `index.php`.

  In 2.0.18.13, youtube links that previously turned into embeds have stopped working for us. Not only do they not turn into embeds, the links themselves disappear on output. Anyone having a similar issue?

  [@PIXELovely](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/PIXELovely) All YouTube links, or a particular format of link?

  [@Linc](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Linc) All of them. I tried disabling all plugins and switching back to the basic theme, and it didn't seem to help.

  [@PIXELovely](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/PIXELovely) Are you getting any Javascript errors on the page? I still haven't seen any other reports of this yet.

  I am experiencing the exact same YouTube issue after upgrading to 2.0.18.13. The only way I can get the videos to sometimes display correctly is if I disable the CLEditor plugin. But that only seems to work with new posts. Editing old posts doesn't bring back the embeded video.

  I decided to reinstall version 2.0.18.11 and now all the videos display correctly. Also, to answer your question [@Linc](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Linc), no, there are no errors that I could see. For example, if the post only had a YouTube link in it and nothing else, it would display as a blank post. And if you look at the page source, the YouTube link wouldn't be present. Just a blank line where the class=Video code is.
