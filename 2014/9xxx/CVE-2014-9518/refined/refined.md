Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-9518:

**Vulnerability Overview**

The D-Link DIR-655 router, specifically with firmware version 2.11NA, has multiple vulnerabilities accessible from the LAN side. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the device.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass in Management Console:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The web interface checks if the IP address matches the authenticating request, but it does not verify that two requests from the same IP address come from the same user. This allows an attacker on the LAN to bypass authentication by accessing the .asp pages directly, if a legitimate user has a valid authenticated session and the attacker uses the same source IP as the logged in user.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient authentication checks.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the router's web management console.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious actor on the local network can exploit this weakness if an administrator/user is logged into the device.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the router and has observed a valid authentication from another user on the network.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Input fields in cgi resources are not properly sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the web interface, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By submitting specially crafted inputs, even without an active login session.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface from the local network.

3.  **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The admin password and wireless encryption key are accessible in the HTML source returned by the router. Although the admin password is obfuscated, the deobfuscation code is available in javascript, and the deobfuscated password can be obtained by an attacker viewing the page's source or DOM inspector.
    *   **Weakness:** Sensitive information is not properly protected.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can easily obtain the router's admin password and wireless encryption key.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By monitoring the network traffic or accessing the web interface via a browser DOM inspector.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to monitor network traffic and/or access the web interface from the LAN side.

4.  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Several resources on the management console reveal device information without any authentication.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication for information disclosure endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gather information about the router and devices connected to it.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By accessing specific URLs, even without an active login session.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface from the local network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   Full control of the router.
*   Compromise of the network.
*   Data theft
*   Malware deployment
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Wireless network access by unauthorized users.

**Mitigation:**

*   D-Link recommends updating to the latest firmware version (v2.12b01 as of the advisory).
*   Disable remote network management access.
*   Secure all devices with strong passwords.
*   Enable WiFi encryption.
*   Keep all PCs and devices updated and scanned for malware.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are mainly LAN-side risks, meaning the attacker must be on the same network or have compromised a device on the network to exploit them.
*   Remote admin access is disabled by default but if enabled the device becomes vulnerable to these attacks from the internet.
