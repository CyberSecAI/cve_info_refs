Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the improper handling of user-supplied URLs by the Alfresco Community Edition's proxy and CMIS browser servlets. These servlets allow users to specify a target URL, which the server then fetches, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF in both the `/proxy` servlet and the `/cmisbrowser` servlet.
2.  **File URI Scheme Support:** Older versions of Alfresco Community Edition (specifically 2.9.0B) support the `file://` URI scheme within the proxy servlet, allowing an attacker to disclose local files on the server.
3.  **Credentials Leakage:** When the `/cmisbrowser` servlet is used to access a resource protected by Basic authentication, the supplied credentials are included in subsequent requests, potentially leaking those credentials to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Internal Port Scanning:** An unauthenticated attacker can use the SSRF vulnerabilities to scan internal systems for open ports and running services.
2.  **Access to Internal Web Applications:** Attackers can potentially gain access to internal web applications that are not exposed to the internet.
3.  **Local File Disclosure:** In older versions, the file:// URI support can lead to the disclosure of sensitive local files.
4.  **Credentials Leakage:** When basic authentication is used with the cmisbrowser, an attacker could intercept user credentials if they are tricked into accessing a malicious resource via the vulnerable servlet.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly craft URLs with the `endpoint` parameter for the `/proxy` servlet or the `url` parameter for the `/cmisbrowser` servlet, to specify internal systems.
    - Example for proxy servlet: `<http://host/alfresco/proxy?endpoint=http://internal_system:port>`
    - Example for cmisbrowser servlet: `<http://host/alfresco/cmisbrowser?url=http://internal_system:port>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Alfresco instance.
2.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring authentication.
3.  **Social Engineering (for credential leakage):** To leak credentials using `cmisbrowser`, the attacker needs to trick a victim into accessing a specific URL with basic authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the vendor's fix in version 5.0.a only properly addresses the /proxy endpoint, while the /cmisbrowser was commented out by default but remains exploitable if enabled.
