- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack. This is triggered by requesting a non-existent file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by requesting a non-existent file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skill can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network. No authentication is needed.
