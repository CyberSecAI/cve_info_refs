Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Scribunto extension in MediaWiki, which allows Lua modules to process content from arbitrary wiki pages, including special pages. When combined with TemplateSandbox extension and under specific conditions, this capability allows an attacker to extract data through timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Data Leakage:** The core vulnerability is the ability to leak information across origins. This is achieved through timing attacks enabled by the Scribunto extension.
*   **Unrestricted Special Page HTML Processing:** Scribunto modules can process HTML content from special pages, including sensitive information such as rollback tokens.
*   **Insecure TemplateSandbox:** The TemplateSandbox extension allows users to execute Scribunto modules without proper authorization or checks. Specifically, it allows submission of malicious modules through forms in iframes without an edit token.
*   **Timing Attack:** The vulnerability relies on the ability of the attacker to measure the time it takes for a page to load, which can be manipulated by the malicious Scribunto module to vary depending on the value of a bit in the targeted token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data, such as rollback tokens, from a wiki by carefully timing the page load.
*   **Cross-Site Information Leakage:**  The attacker's site, loaded in a user's browser, can exfiltrate data from the target wiki due to the cross-origin timing attack.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** The extracted rollback tokens might be usable to perform actions on the target wiki if the user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Scribunto Module:**  The attacker crafts a malicious Lua module designed to extract information using timing techniques.
*   **TemplateSandbox:** The attacker uses the TemplateSandbox extension to submit the malicious module. This can be done by submitting a form into an iframe.
*   **Special Page Data Access:** The module uses Scribunto's capabilities to preprocess special pages (e.g. Special:Contributions) and obtain HTML which contains the target data (e.g. rollback tokens).
*   **Timing Manipulation:** The malicious module uses delays (possibly via `os.clock()`) to encode information into the page load time.
*   **Cross-Origin Measurement:**  The attacker's website measures the loading time of the page (which is controlled by the malicious module in the iframe) to leak the data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of an Existing Module:** The attacker needs to know the name and contents of an existing module on the target wiki.
*   **Knowledge of a Page Using the Module:** The attacker must be aware of at least one page on the wiki that uses the target module.
*   **TemplateSandbox access:** TemplateSandbox must be installed and accessible.
*   **Ability to submit form to an iframe:** The attacker must be able to submit a form into an iframe that points to the target wiki, to leverage TemplateSandbox.
*  **Ability to measure page load time:** The attacker needs to have the ability to accurately measure page load times on their attacking website.
* **Target User with Rollback Rights:** The exploit described requires a user to have the "rollback" right on the wiki being targeted in order for the rollback token to be present and extractable.

**Mitigation:**

The primary fix for this vulnerability is to prevent Scribunto modules from unstripping special page HTML, as mentioned in the Phabricator task. Additionally, restricting the use of TemplateSandbox without an edit token is also recommended.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was demonstrated to successfully extract a rollback token in about three minutes.
*   The issue is specific to wikis with the TemplateSandbox extension installed or if all conditions are met (knowledge of module and page, TemplateSandbox extension installed).
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by a code change that prevents access to special page HTML, as confirmed by the Gerrit change mentioned in the task details.
*   The fix was backported to relevant MediaWiki releases as confirmed in the release notes provided.
