How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : drupal7
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9015 CVE-2014-9016

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured content
management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:

CVE-2014-9015

    Aaron Averill discovered that a specially crafted request can give a
    user access to another user's session, allowing an attacker to
    hijack a random session.

CVE-2014-9016

    Michael Cullum, Javier Nieto and Andres Rojas Guerrero discovered
    that the password hashing API allows an attacker to send
    specially crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory
    exhaustion. This may lead to the site becoming unavailable or
    unresponsive (denial of service).

Custom configured session.inc and password.inc need to be audited as
well to verify if they are prone to these vulnerabilities. More
information can be found in the upstream advisory at
<https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-006>

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: Pending CVE assignments for SA-CORE-2014-006?

Hi

I just wanted to ask back if the CVEs for SA-CORE-2014-006[1] were
already requested (the advisory mention that they will be requested
and added to the advisory). If so this will ease tracking the two
issues. For reference they are:

> Session hijacking (Drupal 6 and 7)
>
> A specially crafted request can give a user access to another user's
> session, allowing an attacker to hijack a random session.
>
> This attack is known to be possible on certain Drupal 7 sites which
> serve both HTTP and HTTPS content ("mixed-mode"), but it is possible
> there are other attack vectors for both Drupal 6 and Drupal 7.
>
> Denial of service (Drupal 7 only)
>
> Drupal 7 includes a password hashing API to ensure that user
> supplied passwords are not stored in plain text.
>
> A vulnerability in this API allows an attacker to send specially
> crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory exhaustion. This may
> lead to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of
> service).
>
> This vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.

They are fixed in Drupal7 7.34 and Drupal6 6.34.
