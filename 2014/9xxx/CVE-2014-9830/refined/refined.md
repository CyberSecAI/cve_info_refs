Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how ImageMagick handles corrupted SUN files. Specifically, it's related to an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The core issue is an out-of-bounds access when processing a malformed SUN file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unspecified impact:** The provided information does not explicitly detail the potential consequences of exploiting this vulnerability. However, out-of-bounds reads can lead to crashes (Denial of Service) and potentially information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted, corrupted SUN image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with the malicious image file. This could be through a website that processes user-uploaded images, or some other means where the application parses user-supplied data.

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-9830 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability within ImageMagick, specifically occurring when processing corrupted SUN files. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a malicious image file, leading to a crash or information disclosure. The specific impact is not detailed.
