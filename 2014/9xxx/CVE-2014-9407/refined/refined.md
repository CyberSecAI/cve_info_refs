Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of HTTP GET requests for actions that modify data (e.g., deleting entities, unlinking accounts) within the Revive Adserver web console. These GET requests were not protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection in the application's handling of GET requests for sensitive operations. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation could lead to the deletion of various entities within the Revive Adserver system.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Data loss could also lead to disruptions in the ad serving functionality of the application.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could make changes to the system by tricking a logged in user into executing actions via forged requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links or Websites:** An attacker could use a malicious link or website that sends a forged request to the vulnerable Revive Adserver instance, which would trigger the deletion or unlinking action when a logged-in user visits the link.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might trick a user into clicking a malicious link, either directly or through other means, leading to the execution of the forged request in the user's active session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No direct access to the Revive Adserver console required.** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the Revive Adserver system.
*   **Target User Must Be Logged In:** The attacker needs a logged-in user to visit the malicious link.
*   **Ability to create malicious links or websites:**  The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute malicious links or web pages containing the crafted requests.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker would need to know the structure of the GET requests to successfully trigger the desired actions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Revive Adserver versions 3.0.4 and earlier, and potentially in OpenX Source 2.8.11 and older versions, including phpAdsNew 2.0.x.
*   The provided patch adds session token validation to the GET requests via the `OA_Permission::checkSessionToken()` method and the `rv_add_session_token` template helper function. The session token is added as a parameter in the GET request, protecting the request from CSRF by validating the authenticity of the request origin.
*   The fix does not refactor the entire UI to a proper MVC framework. Instead, it applies a session token based protection for the vulnerable GET endpoints.

The advisory also lists a number of specific scripts that were vulnerable and subsequently fixed, including:
