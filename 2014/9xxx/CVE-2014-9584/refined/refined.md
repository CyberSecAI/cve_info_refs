Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9584:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the Linux kernel's ISO9660 filesystem implementation when parsing Rock Ridge Extension Reference (ER) records. The kernel does not properly validate the length of these records, leading to a potential read of kernel memory beyond the allocated buffer during printing/processing of the records.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Failure to properly allocate and manage memory when parsing Rock Ridge ER records.
- Information Disclosure: Ability to read kernel memory by exploiting the memory leak.
- Insufficient input validation: The kernel does not validate the length of Rock Ridge ER records, which allows an attacker to trigger the memory leak

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local user can exploit this flaw by mounting a crafted iso9660 image.
- Exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from kernel memory. The size of the leak is limited to 255 bytes.
- In a denial of service context (CVE-2015-1137) the flaw could also result in a denial of service on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs local access to mount a crafted iso9660 image.
- Physical access: Some reports mention physical access to the system, which would also allow an attacker to mount the crafted ISO.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to mount file systems (ISO images).
- Knowledge of how to create a crafted iso9660 image.
