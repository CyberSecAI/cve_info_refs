      "description": "The batadv_frag_merge_packets function in net/batman-adv/fragmentation.c in the B.A.T.M.A.N. implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 uses an incorrect length field during a calculation of an amount of memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented packets.",
      "extracted_data": {
        "root_cause": "The `batadv_frag_merge_packets` function in `net/batman-adv/fragmentation.c` incorrectly calculates the required tailroom for a merged packet using the length of the parameter `skb` instead of the length of the destination buffer `skb_out`.",
        "vulnerabilities": "Incorrect length calculation during the merging of fragmented packets in the batman-adv module. The function `pskb_expand_head` increases the tailroom of the first queued skb (`skb_out`) based on the size of parameter skb, which is not always the same as skb_out and has a different length. This results in writing beyond the allocated buffer.",
        "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash).",
        "attack_vectors": "Sending specially crafted fragmented packets via the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced Meshing Protocol.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker capable of sending fragmented packets to a vulnerable mesh node.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability was introduced in Linux 3.13 when the fragmentation code was replaced and is fixed by commit 5b6698b0e4a37053de35cc24ee695b98a7eb712b. The issue occurs when a fragmented packet with a later fragment number is received and queued, followed by a packet with an earlier fragment number. When the fragments are merged, the tailroom is expanded for the first queued packet, but the size calculation is based on the last received packet. This leads to a buffer overflow when trying to copy the remaining fragments into the first packet."
