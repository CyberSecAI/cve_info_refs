*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2014-9849**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the PNG coder of ImageMagick.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The PNG coder has a bug leading to a crash.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by causing the application to crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attackers can trigger the crash by providing a specially crafted PNG image file to the vulnerable ImageMagick instance
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2014-9850**
*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect thread limit logic in ImageMagick.

*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service due to resource exhaustion
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted image file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2014-9851**

*   **Root Cause:** A parsing error in handling resource blocks within ImageMagick.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** A vulnerability leading to a crash when parsing specific resource blocks.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attacker can trigger the crash with crafted image file that contains a malformed resource block.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2014-9845**
*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the `ReadDIBImage` function in ImageMagick.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Corrupted DIB files can cause a crash in ImageMagick.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Remote attacker provides a corrupted DIB file to the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2014-9846**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in the `ReadRLEImage` function within ImageMagick.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the RLE image handling code, where an attacker could write outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker could cause arbitrary code execution and denial of service due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attackers can send crafted image files that trigger the buffer overflow in the RLE processing function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2016-8866**

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete fix for `CVE-2016-8862` leading to memory allocation failure in the `AcquireMagickMemory` function.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** A memory allocation failure that leads to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trigger a memory allocation failure, potentially causing a denial of service or a heap overflow under specific circumstances.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attackers can send crafted images that trigger a memory allocation failure in ImageMagick.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**CVE-2016-8707**
*  **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the handling of compressed TIFF images.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Improper handling of compressed TIFF images leads to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** A crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds write which in particular circumstances could be leveraged into remote code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Attacker can send a specially crafted TIFF file to a system utilizing the vulnerable component, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user or system processing TIFF files through ImageMagick.

**CVE-2016-9556**
*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds heap read in `IsPixelGray` function of ImageMagick.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds heap read occurs due to improper handling of pixel access in the `IsPixelGray` function.
*  **Impact:** A crafted image file can cause a denial of service by triggering the out-of-bounds heap read.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker needs the ability to send network requests to a system processing images with the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**Summary of Common Elements**
