# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-003: Link spoofing and cache poisoning vulnerabilities in TYPO3 CMS

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Helmut Hummel

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to Link Spoofing and Cache Poisoning.

**Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS

**Vulnerability Types:** Link Spoofing, Cache Poisoning

**Overall Severity:** Medium

**Release Date:** December 10, 2014

## Vulnerable subcomponent: Frontend Rendering

**Vulnerability Type:** Link Spoofing

**Affected Versions:** Versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.38, 4.6.0 to 4.6.18, 4.7.0 to 4.7.20, 6.0.0 to 6.0.14, 6.1.0 to 6.1.12 and 6.2.0 to 6.2.8, 7.0.0 to 7.0.1

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C))

**CVE:** [CVE-2014-9508](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9508)

**Problem Description:** An attacker could forge a request, which modifies anchor only links on the *homepage* of a TYPO3 installation in a way that they point to arbitrary domains, if the configuration option *[config.prefixLocalAnchors](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/Setup/Config/Index.html#prefixlocalanchors)* is used with any possible value. TYPO3 versions 4.6.x and higher are only affected if the homepage is **not** a shortcut to a different page. AS an additional pre-condition URL rewriting must be enabled in the web server, which typically is, when using extensions like realurl or cooluri.

Installation where *[config.absRefPrefix](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix)* is **additionally set** to any value are **not affected** by this vulnerability.

Example of affected configuration:

TypoScript:

```

config.absRefPrefix =
config.prefixLocalAnchors = all
page = PAGE
page.10 = TEXT
page.10.value = <a href="#skiplinks">Skiplinks</a>
```

.htaccess:

```

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule .* index.php [L]
```

**Solution:** Set config.absRefPrefix to a value fitting your installation

or

**Solution:** Update to TYPO3 versions 4.5.39, 6.2.9 or 7.0.2 that fix the problem described.

**Important Note:** Since the changes provided with the TYPO3 update change the way the prefix for local anchors is generated, there might be cases where the update breaks functionality. The impact of the breakage is that the page is reloaded in the browser when a user follows a link where previously the browser only jumped to a certain section of the current page.

**Credits:** Thanks to Gernot Leitgab who discovered and reported the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Type:** Cache Poisoning

**Affected Versions:** Versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.38, 4.6.0 to 4.6.18, 4.7.0 to 4.7.20, 6.0.0 to 6.0.14, 6.1.0 to 6.1.12 and 6.2.0 to 6.2.8, 7.0.0 to 7.0.1

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C))

**CVE:**not assigned yet

**Problem Description:** A request URL with arbitrary arguments, but still pointing to the home page of  a TYPO3 installation can be cached if the configuration option *[config.prefixLocalAnchors](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/Setup/Config/Index.html#prefixlocalanchors)*is used with the values "all" or "cached". The impact of this vulnerability is that unfamiliar looking links to the home page can end up in the cache, which leads to a reload of the page in the browser when section links are followed by web page visitors, instead of just directly jumping to the requested section of the page. TYPO3 versions 4.6.x and higher are only affected if the homepage is **not** a shortcut to a different page.

**Solution:** Removing the configuration options config.prefixLocalAnchors (and optionally also config.baseUrl) in favor of config.absRefPrefix

**Credits:** Thanks to Gernot Leitgab who discovered and reported the vulnerability.

**General Advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Opens external link in new window"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.
