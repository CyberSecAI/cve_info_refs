| Related previous discussion about encoding: [#783 (comment)](https://github.com/webodf/WebODF/pull/783#discussion_r16573766)  I have no idea how to run the tests and don't feel very keen to install Qt and Co. for that on my machine.  Installing Qt5 (at least what is needed for QWebKit) should be sufficient to get the test running automatically. Not much Co. should be coinstalled by that. Ask your package manager.  Then, you can also run the tests manually using your browser though:  ``` cd webodf/webodf node httpserver.js  ```  then navigate your browser(s) to <http://127.0.0.1:8124/tests/tests.html>  You could also use a custom webserver, but some tests expect to be able to save files by PUT requests, so they would fail with other webservers that do not do the expected PUT handling.  Task for me: add note about httpserver.js to webodf/tests/README |

There is actually an easier way to do this that avoids any manual HTML escaping:

```
element.innerHTML = "";
element.appendChild(element.ownerDocument.createTextNode(runtime.tr('Loading') + url + '...'));

```

That would be my preference here ![:bowtie:](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/bowtie.png ":bowtie:")

Fair point. Will adjust. My Javascript clean-code ability are somewhat suboptimal ;-)

WebODF tag 0.5.3

Fields in slides and documents are shown with grey background in non-editing mode, which seems not right to me. It should be controllable in some way, and by default turned off.
