  "CVE-2014-9853": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "Curation": "Relevant",
      "Original_Description": "Memory leak in coders/rle.c in ImageMagick allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted rle file."
    },
    "Vulnerability_Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the rle file handling within the coders/rle.c file of ImageMagick.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak",
          "Resource Consumption"
      ],
       "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting the memory leak, leading to excessive memory consumption. This could result in application instability or crash",
      "Attack Vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted RLE file, which can be done remotely by an attacker.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the application with a specially crafted RLE file."
    }
