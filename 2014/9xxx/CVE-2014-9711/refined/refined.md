The provided content describes two distinct Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Websense Reporting and Websense Explorer report scheduler. While both are XSS issues in Websense products, they are different vulnerabilities, and thus, only one is related to the placeholder CVE. Based on the vulnerability descriptions, it appears that CVE-2014-9711 is likely related to the **multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Websense Reporting**, and not the report scheduler.

**Vulnerability 1: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Websense Reporting**

*   **Root cause:** Improper encoding of request parameters when used in HTML reports. Specifically, the `col` parameter's value is directly inserted into an HTML attribute without output encoding.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding of user-supplied data within the HTML context.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary client-side scripting code, leading to actions such as stealing session tokens or login credentials, performing actions on the victim's behalf, and logging keystrokes.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the injected script in the vulnerable parameter (`col`) and tricks a victim into opening the link.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick victims into accessing it.

**Vulnerability 2: XSS vulnerability in Websense Explorer report scheduler**

*   **Root cause:** The report name is not properly encoded when the report is rendered.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding of a stored report name in the application's database, when rendered in HTML.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the output of the application, which will execute within the browser of any authenticated user (admin or auditor) who views the relevant DLP incident. This could lead to stealing session tokens, performing actions on the victim's behalf, or logging keystrokes.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker schedules a report containing a specially crafted `ReportName` with malicious javascript.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker must be able to create a scheduled report.

Based on the above analysis, the first vulnerability relates to CVE-2014-9711.
