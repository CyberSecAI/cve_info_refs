{
  "CVE-2014-9645": {
    "description": "The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated by an \"ifconfig /usbserial up\" command or a \"mount -t /snd_pcm none /\" command.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "< 1.23.1",
      "<= 2.05.3",
      "<= 2.03.17",
      "<= 1.03.17",
	  "<1:1.23.0-9+deb8u2",
	  "1.22.x",
      "<=1.22.0-15ubuntu1.4",
      "<=1:1.21.0-1ubuntu1.4"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `modprobe` utility in BusyBox incorrectly uses the basename of the module argument, ignoring any path information, when loading kernel modules. This allows loading modules with names containing forward slashes, bypassing intended restrictions enforced by the kernel's module loading mechanism.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of module paths in `modprobe`",
      "Bypass of module loading restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged local user can bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel modules, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation by loading malicious kernel modules.",
	"attack_vectors": [
		"Local access to the system",
        "Using `ifconfig` command with a module name containing a forward slash",
        "Using `mount` command with a module name containing a forward slash",
		"Through configuration upload in web interface by modifying filename parameter"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access to execute commands. For command injection, access to the web interface and its upload feature.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because `modprobe` extracts the basename from the provided module name, ignoring any path components. For instance, if a kernel subsystem uses a prefix like 'netdev-' to control module loading, an attacker could bypass this restriction by requesting the module `/usbserial`, which `modprobe` would then load as `usbserial` after ignoring the path part. This allows loading arbitrary modules by nullifying enforced module prefixes."
