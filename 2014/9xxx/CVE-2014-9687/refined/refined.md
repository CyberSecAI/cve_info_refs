**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability lies in the way `ecryptfs-utils` generates a wrapping key from the user's password. It uses the SHA-512 hash function applied 65536 times. Critically, it uses a default, fixed salt (0x0011223344556677) when hashing the wrapping key. This fixed salt is used across all installations which allows an attacker to precompute rainbow tables making it easier to crack user passwords.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Key Derivation:** Using a fixed salt makes the key derivation process vulnerable to pre-computed attacks like rainbow tables. The default salt is the same across most installations of eCryptfs when encrypting user home directories.
    *   **Lack of Per-User Salt:** The system does not generate a unique salt for each user's encrypted home directory, resulting in a single point of vulnerability for multiple user accounts.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker who gains access to the wrapped-passphrase file (which is located at `~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase`) can use rainbow tables and dictionary attacks to crack user passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to user files.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is primarily through offline password cracking. Once the attacker has obtained the `wrapped-passphrase` file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to obtain the `wrapped-passphrase` file, which is typically located in the user's home directory. This could be achieved if the attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system or has access to a backup.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a new passphrase wrapping format in `ecryptfs-utils`, which uses randomly generated salts per user (version 2).
    *   The fix also includes transparent migration from the old format to the new format via `pam_ecryptfs`.

*   **Affected Systems:**
    *   Ubuntu distributions using ecryptfs for home folder encryption since version 10.04.
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 and 12, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 and 12, and openSUSE (as detailed in the SUSE Bugzilla entry and advisory information).

*   **Vendor Perspective:**
    *   The use of a default salt was not considered to be the intended behavior. The documentation advised users to provide their own salt.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The wrapping key is generated using SHA-512, which is iterated 65536 times for key strengthening before the salt is applied to it.

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-9687 is a vulnerability in `ecryptfs-utils` where the use of a fixed default salt during password-based key derivation for encrypted home directories creates a vulnerability to rainbow table and dictionary attacks. The vulnerability was resolved by generating per-user random salts to prevent pre-computation attacks on encrypted home directories.
