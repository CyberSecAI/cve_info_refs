- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in Advantech's WebAccess application. The vulnerability occurs because the application fails to properly validate the length of strings provided to functions in affected DLLs when processing specially crafted files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The application does not perform proper bounds checking on input strings when loading specially crafted files.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to crash the WebAccess application or execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires a user to open a specially crafted file. This often requires some form of social engineering.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to get a local user to execute a malicious file using the vulnerable application.
