Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Root Explorer and Explorer process file names, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-22 Path Traversal:** The applications do not properly sanitize or validate file names, allowing attackers to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can create arbitrary files or overwrite existing files within directories that the application has access to.
- The integrity of the system is impacted as attackers can modify files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning that the attacker does not need local access to the affected device.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely and without needing authentication.
- The exact attack method isn't detailed, but it likely involves crafting malicious file names with path traversal sequences (e.g., "../")

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device running the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any local access or prior knowledge of the device's file structure.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS v2 score is 4.3, indicating a medium severity.
- Affected products include:
    - Root Explorer versions prior to 3.2
    - Explorer versions prior to 2.2
- The vulnerability was reported by Ryohei Koike of Sakura Information Systems Co., Ltd. to IPA.
- The issue is a network exploitable path traversal vulnerability.
