Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `site_url` parameter in the `install.php` file of Morfy CMS v1.05. The application directly uses user-provided input from the `site_url` parameter within the `file_put_contents` function when creating the `config.php` file, leading to code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Static code injection:** The application doesn't sanitize the `site_url` parameter before writing it to the `config.php` file.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input in the install process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote command execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the `config.php` file. This allows the execution of system-specific commands, leading to potential compromise of the web application and potentially the connected database.
- **Content Management System compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to fully compromise the CMS.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `install.php`.
- **`site_url` parameter:** Malicious code is injected via the `site_url` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any privileged user account or user interaction.
- **No authentication required**: The vulnerability exists in the installation process, meaning no authentication is required to exploit it.

**Technical Details:**
- The `install.php` file takes the `site_url` parameter from the POST request.
- It writes this parameter value directly into the `config.php` file within a PHP array definition.
- Because the value is not sanitized, an attacker can inject PHP code, which will then be executed when the `config.php` file is accessed.

**Example Payload:**
The provided PoC uses the following payload injected as the `site_url`: `website.com}','yibelo'=> eval("system('dir');"),`

This payload, when placed inside the config.php, would result in a file that contains:
`'site_url' => 'website.com}','yibelo'=> eval("system('dir');"),'`

The injected code `eval("system('dir');")` gets executed when the `config.php` is included, executing the system command `dir` on the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity by Vulnerability Lab with a CVSS score of 6.2, while GitHub advisory considers it "Moderate"
- The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction and without a privileged application user account
- The vulnerability is found in the default installation process of Morfy CMS v1.05.
- Patches suggested include sanitizing and restricting special characters in the input of `site_url`
