# CVE-ID:

[CVE-2014-9185](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-89w9-gmvc-mfp8 "CVE-2014-9185")

# Technical Details & Description:

A command execution web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Morfy v1.05 Content Management System.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to unauthorized execution system specific commands that compromises the online

web-application or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the site\_url parameter of the default content management system install.php file.

Remote attackers are able to execute system specific commands to compromise the application by usage of malicious

requests that run through the vulnerable site\_url value. The request method to inject the code is POST via Add.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as critical with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)

count of 5.2. Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires no privileged application user account or user interaction.

Successful exploitation of the command execution vulnerability results in content management system compromise.

Request Method(s):

[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):

[+] Install

Vulnerable File(s):

[+] install.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):

[+] site\_url

# Proof of Concept (PoC):

The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privileged application user account.

For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...

1. Download the morfy content management system
2. Use the default and access the installation file (install.php)
3. Inject the following payload `website.com}','yibelo'=> eval("system('dir');"),` (as website url) by usage of the Add function
4. Then navigate to site.com/config.php which shall get executed because that will result site\_url'='website.com}','yibelo'=>eval("system('dir');"),//',
5. Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!

Vulnerable Source: install.php < config.php

./install.php Line 57

$post\_site\_url = isset($\_POST['site\_url']) ? $\_POST['site\_url'] : '';

./install.php Line 64-77

file\_put\_contents('config.php', "<?php

return array(

'site\_url' => '{$post\_site\_url}',

'site\_charset' => 'UTF-8',

'site\_timezone' => '{$post\_site\_timezone}',

'site\_theme' => 'default',

'site\_title' => '{$post\_site\_title}',

'site\_description' => '{$post\_site\_description}',

'site\_keywords' => '{$post\_site\_keywords}',

'email' => '{$post\_email}',

'plugins' => array(

CVE-ID:
=======
CVE-2014-9185
Release Date:
=============
2014-12-10
Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================
1367
Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
6.2
Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Morfy is a flat file CMS, this means there is no administration backend and database to deal with. You simply create .md files
in the `content` folder and that becomes a page. To run Morfy you simple need PHP 5.3.0 or higher with PHP`s Multibyte String module.
Operation system: Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac OS. Webserver: Apache with Mod Rewrite or Ngnix with Rewrite Module.
(Copy of the Vendor Homepage: http://morfy.monstra.org/documentation )
Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered a remote command execution vulnerability in the official Morfy v1.05 Content Management System.
Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2014-11-02: Researcher Notification & Coordination (Paulos Yibelo)
2014-12-10: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)
Discovery Status:
=================
Published
Affected Product(s):
====================
GNU GPL License
Product: Morfy - Content Management System 1.05
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A command execution web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Morfy v1.05 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to unauthorized execution system specific commands that compromises the online
web-application or connected dbms.
The vulnerability is located in the site\_url parameter of the default content management system install.php file.
Remote attackers are able to execute system specific commands to compromise the application by usage of malicious
requests that run through the vulnerable site\_url value. The request method to inject the code is POST via Add.
The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 6.2. Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires no privileged application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the command execution vulnerability results in content management system compromise.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Install
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] install.php
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] site\_url
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privileged application user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the security vulnerability ...
1. Download the morfy content management system
2. Use the default and access the installation file (install.php)
3. Inject the following payload `website.com}','yibelo'=> eval("system('dir');"),` (as website url) by usage of the Add function
4. Then navigate to site.com/config.php which shall get executed because that will result site\_url'='website.com}','yibelo'=>eval("system('dir');"),//',
5. Successful reproduce of the security vulnerability!
Vulnerable Source: install.php < config.php
./install.php Line 57
$post\_site\_url = isset($\_POST['site\_url']) ? $\_POST['site\_url'] : '';
./install.php Line 64-77
file\_put\_contents('config.php', "php
return array(
'site\_url' = '{$post\_site\_url}',
'site\_charset' => 'UTF-8',
'site\_timezone' => '{$post\_site\_timezone}',
'site\_theme' => 'default',
'site\_title' => '{$post\_site\_title}',
'site\_description' => '{$post\_site\_description}',
'site\_keywords' => '{$post\_site\_keywords}',
'email' => '{$post\_email}',
'plugins' => array(
'markdown',
'sitemap',
), );");
Reference(s):
http://morfy.127.0.0.1:8080/install.php
http://morfy.127.0.0.1:8080/config.php
Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure restriction in the config.php file that requests the vulnerable site\_url value.
Encode and parse the vulnerable site\_url in the add input field of the installation module (install.php).
Restrict the input fields and disallow special chars to prevent system specific command executions.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote command execution vulnerability in the php engine of the web-application is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.2)
