## Analysis of CVE-2014-9912

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9912, including information from the referenced PHP bug report:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The Red Hat content references `CVE-2014-9912`, and it appears to be a placeholder, as there is no information available.
*   The PHP changelog indicates that fixes for `CVE-2014-9912` were implemented by limiting the length of strings passed to ICU, to avoid buffer overflows. The PHP bug report, identified by the ID 67397, discusses a related buffer overflow issue.
*   The openwall.com content discusses `CVE-2014-9911` and mentions `CVE-2014-9912` as a related PHP vulnerability that had the same root cause and fix motivation in ICU.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla content references `CVE-2014-9911` and mentions `CVE-2014-9912` as a related PHP vulnerability, both of which are caused by stack-based buffer overflows.

Therefore, the content relates to **CVE-2014-9912**. While CVE-2014-9912 is a placeholder CVE, the information available strongly links it to a fix in PHP stemming from the same root cause in ICU that was addressed by CVE-2014-9911.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `uloc_getDisplayName()` function within the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library.
    *   Specifically, a locale string with more than 255 characters, when passed to the function, could overwrite a buffer on the stack.
    *   This occurs because the function copies a resource path to a stack buffer and then appends a user-supplied locale key to that buffer without proper length validation, using `uprv_strcpy`.
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered in PHP by calling `locale_get_display_name()` with an excessively long locale string.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** A fixed-size buffer on the stack is susceptible to overflowing due to a missing bounds check.
    *   **Insecure String Copying:** The use of `strcpy` to append user-supplied data into a buffer without a length check makes it vulnerable.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exploitation can lead to crashes, and potentially, code execution by overwriting the stack.
    *   The Red Hat bugzilla content suggests that the use of `-fstack-protector-strong` provides some level of defense against code execution, limiting the impact to mostly crashes. However, information leaks that would permit an attacker to discover the stack canary could lead to code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector involves passing a locale string exceeding 255 characters to the `uloc_getDisplayName()` function via the PHP's `locale_get_display_name()` function.
    *   In PHP, this vulnerability was exposed in the processing of locale strings and INI files.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to influence the locale string being passed to the vulnerable function. For a web application, this could involve manipulating HTTP request headers, POST parameters, or other user-controlled data.
    *   In the specific context of the PHP fix for this issue, an attacker would need the ability to trigger the `locale_get_display_name()` function with an excessively long locale string or manipulate INI files.

**3. Additional Details Beyond the CVE Description:**

*   The PHP bug report (#67397) provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability.
*   The provided PHP code snippet, shows how an overlong locale string can cause a stack buffer overflow via the vulnerable ICU function: `uloc_getDisplayName`.
*   The fix implemented in PHP limits the length of locale strings passed to ICU, avoiding the overflow.
*   The provided information highlights that the fix for CVE-2014-9911 in ICU was also used as a basis to fix a similar vulnerability within PHP, which was designated as CVE-2014-9912. This indicates both CVEs relate to the same root cause but were addressed by different fixes in different libraries.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla content further clarifies that the core issue resides within the ICU library itself.

## Summary

CVE-2014-9912, while a placeholder in the official CVE database, relates to a stack-based buffer overflow in the `uloc_getDisplayName()` function of the ICU library. This vulnerability was discovered and addressed in the PHP project and has a corresponding PHP bug report. While the provided information doesn't reveal specific details about the affected software from CVE ID, it suggests that CVE-2014-9912 is related to an inadequate string length check within the PHP implementation, leading to buffer overflows. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating locale strings to trigger a crash, and possibly, achieve arbitrary code execution. The mitigations and fixes applied were to limit user-supplied strings that are passed to the vulnerable functions.
