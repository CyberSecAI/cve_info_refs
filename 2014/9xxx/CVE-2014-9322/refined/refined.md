    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The root cause is a flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of the GS segment register when recovering from a #SS (stack segment) fault during an erroneous return to user space. Specifically, the kernel did not properly ensure that the GS register contained the kernel GS base rather than the user GS base, which allowed for incorrect privilege handling, because paranoid entry does not contain the swapgs fixup.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect handling of the GS segment register during #SS fault recovery.",
        "Potential for privilege escalation by local, unprivileged users due to incorrect gsbase handling when returning to user space after a #SS fault."
      ],
      "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system by taking advantage of the GS register being user-controlled during a stack segment fault.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local exploitation by an unprivileged user.",
      "The vulnerability is triggered during an IRET instruction resulting in a #SS fault."
      ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "Local, unprivileged user capabilities are sufficient to exploit this issue."
