Thank you for your report. I have marked this issue as private, so whatever you write here will only be visible to MantisBT developers.  To report your issues, the best would be for you to open one *private* issue on this tracker for each distinct vulnerability you found. More details on the process can be found on our wiki [1].  I also draw your attention to the fact that over the past few weeks we've patched 20+ security issues; kindly make sure that the issues you discovered are not already fixed. See our changelog [2] for details and related CVEs; note that I'm waiting for MITRE to assign a few more CVEs, you can find the corresponding requests and advisories on the oss-security mailing list [3].  [1] [https://www.mantisbt.org/wiki/doku.php/mantisbt:handling\_security\_problems](https://www.mantisbt.org/wiki/doku.php/mantisbt%3Ahandling_security_problems) [2] <https://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/changelog_page.php?version_id=191> [3] <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general> |

Improper access control vulnerability discloses database's credentials (login and password) in plaintext.  1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in MantisBT  Vulnerabilities described in this section can be used by attackers to steal cookies of application’s administrator and other website users. Attackers can also perform spear phishing attacks against web site visitors by replacing original content of the web site with arbitrary HTML and script code, perform drive-by-download attacks by injecting malware into web pages, and bypass existing CSRF protection mechanism.  1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of input data passed via the "admin\_username" and "admin\_password" HTTP GET parameters to "/[admin]/install.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.  Below are two exploitation examples that use the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:  [http://mantis/[admin]/install.php?install=1&admin\_username=1%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E](http://mantis/%5Badmin%5D/install.php?install=1&admin_username=1%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E) [http://mantis/[admin]/install.php?install=1&admin\_password=1%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E](http://mantis/%5Badmin%5D/install.php?install=1&admin_password=1%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27immuniweb%27%29;%3C/script%3E)  Note, that "[admin]" in the URL is changed by default during MantisBT installation. Therefore, the attacker must know the location of the administrative interface in order to perform the attack. However, admin panel URL can be bruteforced or predicted in many cases.  2) Improper Access Control in MantisBT  2.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient access restrictions to the installation script "/[admin]/install.php" when HTTP GET "install" parameter is set to "4". A remote unauthenticated attacker can access the installation script and obtain database access credentials, which are stored in plain text in hidden form fields.  An attacker can use the following URL to access the page an obtain database credentials (login and password) in plaintext:  [http://mantis/[admin]/install.php?install=4](http://mantis/%5Badmin%5D/install.php?install=4)  Note, that "[admin]" in the URL is changed by default during installation. Therefore, the attacker must know the location of the administrative interface in order to perform the attack. However, admin panel URL can be bruteforced or predicted in many cases.  3) SQL Injection in MantisBT  The vulnerability can be used to manipulate existing SQL queries. An attacker can obtain potentially sensitive data and use it to elevate privileges within the application. It is also possible for certain configurations to upload a backdoor and gain complete access to the webserver or website.  3.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of the "MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE" HTTP COOKIE in "/manage\_user\_page.php" script. A remote user with administrative privileges can inject and execute arbitrary SQL code within the application’s database.  The exploit code below modifies the SQL query and injects malicious "INTO OUTFILE" statement. As a result,current MySQL user login will be written into the "/var/www/file.txt" file:  GET /manage\_user\_page.php?hideinactive=0 HTTP/1.1 Host: mantis Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Cookie: MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE=0%3Ausername%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/file.txt%27%20--%20%3A1%3A0 Connection: keep-alive  Successful exploitation requires that the MySQL account has FILE privileges within the database.  To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must create a specially crafted cookie for the application administrator. This can be achieved using XSS vulnerabilities, described in paragraphs 1.1 – 1.3 of this advisory.  ===============================================================  Best regards,  High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab |

I opened the following child issues for tracking:  1.1 - [0017938](/bugs/view.php?id=17938 "[closed] CVE-2014-9571: XSS in install.php") 2.1 - [0017939](/bugs/view.php?id=17939 "[closed] CVE-2014-9572: Improper Access Control in install.php") 3.1 - [0017940](/bugs/view.php?id=17940 "[closed] CVE-2014-9573: SQL Injection in manage_user_page.php")  Considering the upcoming Holiday season and current workload, I am a bit concerned by your planned public disclosure date of 24-Dec - could this be extended to, say, mid-January ? Of course we'll try to fix issues before that if we can.  Did you already make CVE reservations for these ? If so, kindly let me know the IDs. |

You can download the code from <https://mantisbt.org/builds.php>.  I would guess that 1.1 and 2.1 would work too, not sure about 3.1.  TIA |

Kindly test and let me know if they are indeed resolving the vulnerabilities from your point of view.  I would also appreciate if you could let me know the corresponding CVE numbers, MITRE must have assigned them by now.

This vulnerability ([CVE-2014-9573](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7q4-jgj3-fq3m "CVE-2014-9573")) was reported by High-Tech Bridge
Security Research Lab (<https://www.htbridge.com/>) in issue #17937
(advisory ID HTB23243).

To avoid injection, the parameters we get from the cookie are now
properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

Fixes #17940

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| Summary | 0017940: CVE-2014-9573: SQL Injection in manage\_user\_page.php | | | | |
| Description | The vulnerability can be used to manipulate existing SQL queries. An attacker can obtain potentially sensitive data and use it to elevate privileges within the application. It is also possible for certain configurations to upload a backdoor and gain complete access to the webserver or website.  3.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of the "MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE" HTTP COOKIE in "/manage\_user\_page.php" script. A remote user with administrative privileges can inject and execute arbitrary SQL code within the application’s database.  The exploit code below modifies the SQL query and injects malicious "INTO OUTFILE" statement. As a result,current MySQL user login will be written into the "/var/www/file.txt" file:  GET /manage\_user\_page.php?hideinactive=0 HTTP/1.1 Host: mantis Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Cookie: MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE=0%3Ausername%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/file.txt%27%20--%20%3A1%3A0 Connection: keep-alive  Successful exploitation requires that the MySQL account has FILE privileges within the database.  To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must create a specially crafted cookie for the application administrator. This can be achieved using XSS vulnerabilities, described in paragraphs 1.1 – 1.3 of this advisory. | | | | |

Organizations face incremental need to assure their internal and external stakeholders that their data protection and privacy practices meet various international standards, such as PCI DSS, ISO 27001 or NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

High-Tech Bridge has over a decade of experience in security auditing of organizations of all sizes. Our reports are composed of a technical part, tailored for cybersecurity professionals, and an executive summary for the management.

![Custom Exploit Development](img/custom-exploit-development.jpg)

Software always contains security vulnerabilities and weaknesses that lead to data breaches. This is why many security standards and frameworks require obligatory source code review in addition to vulnerability scanning.

High-Tech Bridge experts combine manual and automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to discover all possible security vulnerabilities, weaknesses and misconfigurations.

Security incidents happen all the time, coming both from internal and external threat actors. To understand the scope and the consequences of a security incident, digital forensics of a compromised device is required.

High-Tech Bridge has a solid experience in investigating hacked mobile and computer devices. We provide a detailed, time-based report about the incident, explaining activities of the cybercriminals or insiders.

# CVE-2014-9573: SQL Injection in manage\_user\_page.php

---

*From*: Damien Regad <dregad () mantisbt org>

*Date*: Sat, 17 Jan 2015 01:04:45 +0100

---

```

Greetings,

Please update CVE-2014-9573 with the information below

Description:

```
The vulnerability can be used to manipulate existing SQL queries. An
attacker can obtain potentially sensitive data and use it to elevate
privileges within the application. It is also possible for certain
configurations to upload a backdoor and gain complete access to the
webserver or website.
```

```
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of the
"MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE" HTTP COOKIE in "/manage\_user\_page.php"
script. A remote user with administrative privileges can inject and
execute arbitrary SQL code within the application’s database.
```

```
The exploit code below modifies the SQL query and injects malicious
"INTO OUTFILE" statement. As a result,current MySQL user login will be
written into the "/var/www/file.txt" file:
```

GET /manage_user_page.php?hideinactive=0 HTTP/1.1
Host: mantis
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

```
Cookie:
MANTIS\_MANAGE\_USERS\_COOKIE=0%3Ausername%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/file.txt%27%20--%20%3A1%3A0
```

Connection: keep-alive

```
Successful exploitation requires that the MySQL account has FILE
privileges within the database.
```

```
To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must create a specially
crafted cookie for the application administrator. This can be achieved
using XSS vulnerabilities
```

Affected versions:
- <= 1.2.19
- <= 1.3.0-beta.1

Fixed in versions:
- 1.2.19 (not yet released)
- 1.3.0-beta.2 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:

```
This vulnerability was reported [2] by High-Tech Bridge Security
Research Lab (<https://www.htbridge.com/>), via advisory ID HTB23243 [3].
```

The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).

This vulnerability ([CVE-2014-9573](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7q4-jgj3-fq3m "CVE-2014-9573")) was reported by High-Tech Bridge
Security Research Lab (<https://www.htbridge.com/>) in issue #17937
(advisory ID HTB23243).

To avoid injection, the parameters we get from the cookie are now
properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

Fixes #17940

This vulnerability ([CVE-2014-9573](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7q4-jgj3-fq3m "CVE-2014-9573")) was reported by High-Tech Bridge
Security Research Lab (<https://www.htbridge.com/>) in issue #17937
(advisory ID HTB23243).

To avoid injection, the parameters we get from the cookie are now
properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

Fixes #17940
