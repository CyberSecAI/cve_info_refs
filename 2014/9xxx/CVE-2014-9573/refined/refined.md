  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-9573",
    "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in manage_user_page.php in MantisBT before 1.2.19 and 1.3.x before 1.3.0-beta.2 allows remote administrators with FILE privileges to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the MANTIS_MANAGE_USERS_COOKIE cookie.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient filtration of the MANTIS_MANAGE_USERS_COOKIE HTTP cookie in `/manage_user_page.php`.",
      "vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
       "impact": "An attacker can manipulate existing SQL queries, potentially obtaining sensitive data, elevating privileges, uploading a backdoor, and gaining complete access to the web server or website. Specifically, by injecting an `INTO OUTFILE` statement, the attacker can write the current MySQL user login to a file on the server.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote user with administrative privileges can inject and execute arbitrary SQL code by crafting a malicious cookie.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs administrative privileges within the MantisBT application and requires that the MySQL account used by the application has FILE privileges within the database.  Additionally, the attacker needs to craft a malicious cookie for the application administrator, which can be achieved using XSS vulnerabilities (as noted in the original report linked with this issue)."
