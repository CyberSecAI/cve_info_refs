Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9572:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `install.php` script of MantisBT. Specifically, when the HTTP GET parameter `install` is set to "4", the script exposes database access credentials in plain text within hidden form fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The installation script, specifically the part handling step 4, does not restrict access based on user authentication or session.
- **Information Exposure:** Database credentials (username and password) are exposed in cleartext within hidden form fields of the HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can obtain database access credentials, allowing them to potentially read, modify, or delete data within the MantisBT database.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and privileges, an attacker could potentially gain access to the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a URL with the `install` parameter set to 4, e.g., `http://mantis/[admin]/install.php?install=4`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the MantisBT server.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the administrative interface, which is configurable during installation. This is often `/admin/` but could be different. While the admin panel URL can be bruteforced or predicted in many cases, it is not a trivial task.
