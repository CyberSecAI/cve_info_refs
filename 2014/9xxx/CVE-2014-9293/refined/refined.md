{
  "CVE-2014-9293": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd automatically generates a weak key if no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cryptographically weak default key generation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker matching the configured IP restrictions can guess the generated key and use it to send ntpdc query or configuration requests.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to match configured IP restrictions."
  }
