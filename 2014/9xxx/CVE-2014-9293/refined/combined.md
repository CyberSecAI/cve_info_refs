## NTP Project Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) contains multiple vulnerabilities (Updated)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#852879

Original Release Date: 2014-12-19 | Last Revised: 2015-10-27

---

### Overview

The NTP Project ntpd version 4.2.7 and pervious versions contain several vulnerabilities. ntp-keygen prior to version 4.2.7p230 also uses a non-cryptographic random number generator when generating symmetric keys. These vulnerabilities may affect ntpd acting as a server or client.

### Description

| The Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides networked systems and devices with a way to synchronize time for various services and applications. The reference implementation produced by the NTP Project (ntp.org) contains several vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html): **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2014-9298The IPv6 address ::1 can be spoofed, allowing an attacker to bypass ACLs based on ::1.[**CWE-754**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)**: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions -** CVE-2014-9297The length value in extension field pointers is not properly validated, allowing information leaks.[**CWE-332**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/332.html)**: Insufficient Entropy in PRNG -** CVE-2014-9293If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a cryptographically-weak default key is generated.[**CWE-338**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)**: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) -** CVE-2014-9294ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys.[**CWE-121**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**: Stack Buffer Overflow -** CVE-2014-9295A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto\_recv() (when using autokey authentication), ctl\_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed with the privilege of the ntpd process.[**CWE-389**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/389.html)**: Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes -** CVE-2014-9296A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered. This situation may be exploitable by an attacker.The NTP Project provides more information about these issues in their [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice).The NTP Project implementation is widely used in operating system distributions and network products. These vulnerabilities affect ntpd acting as a server or client. CERT/CC is not aware of any public exploit of these vulnerabilities at this time.The CVSS score below is based on the buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-9295). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ntpd may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary malicious code with the privilege level of the ntpd process. The weak default key and non-cryptographic random number generator in ntp-keygen may allow an attacker to gain information regarding the integrity checking and authentication encryption schemes. More specifically, the weak default key allows access to private mode and control mode queries that require authentication, if not restricted by the configuration. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues have been addressed in ntp-4.2.8p1. The update may be downloaded from [ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Restrict status queries**As noted in the [announcement](http://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2014-December/000122.html) for ntp-4.2.8:The vulnerabilities listed below can be significantly mitigated by following the BCP of putting restrict default ... [noquery](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions#Section_6.5.2)in the ntp.conf file.  With the exception of:   receive(): missing return on error   References: Sec 2670 / CVE-2014-9296 / VU#852879below (which is a limited-risk vulnerability), none of the recent vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited if the source IP is restricted from sending a 'query'-class packet by your ntp.conf file.**Use firewall rules**Install firewall rules that block ::1 IPv6 address from inappropriate network interfaces.**Disable autokey authentication**Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file. |

**Statement Date:   December 19, 2014**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

"Our XTM and Firebox appliances (our main products) are not vulnerable to these flaws, since we use openntpd rather than ntpd.

Our wireless access points are not vulnerable since they only use the basic ntpclient.

However, our XCS appliances (mail security) are vulnerable to the ntpd flaws. We will be releasing a firmware update to fix these flaws as soon as practical. However, in the meantime, we are sharing simple steps to mitigate this issue (use out firewall to block NTP, and point to an internal, updated NTP server instead)."

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 09:16:00 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  Code in ntp_proto.c:receive() was missing a 'return;' in the code path where an error was detected, which meant processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurred. We haven't found a way for this bug to affect system integrity. If there is no way to affect system integrity the base CVSS score for this bug is 0. If there is one avenue through which system integrity can be partially affected, the base score becomes a 5. If system integrity can be partially affected via all three integrity metrics, the CVSS base score become 7.5.  This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.    Mitigation:  Remove or comment out all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:23:12 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2670>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548ad06feXHK1HlZoY-WZVyynwvwAg>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176040#c5)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 09:05:47 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory, multiple buffer overflows were reported in ntp daemon, details provided below  * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv()  When Autokey Authentication is enabled (i.e. the ntp.conf file contains a 'crypto pw ...' directive) a remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   Mitigation:  Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file.  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata()  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   * Buffer overflow in configure()  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious	code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process. This vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:20:17 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2667>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acc4dN1TbM1tRJrbPcA4yc1aTdA>  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2668>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acdf3tUSFizXcv_X4b77Jt_Y-cg>  * Buffer overflow in configure()  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2669>  Upstream commit: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548acf55dxKfhb6MuYQwzu8eDlS97g>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c10)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 14:55:36 UTC  ``` There are three issues described by [CVE-2014-9295](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9295).   * Buffer overflow in crypto_recv() This is an issue when Autokey Authentication is enabled, which it is not by default. As this is a non default setting we rate this issue as having Important impact.  * Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata() This issue is a problem if you allow control messages from untrusted hosts. By default these messages are allowed from localhost only. As this is a non default setting we rate this issue as having Important impact.  * Buffer overflow in configure() Our analysis has shown this issue would be a denial of service and not allow remote code execution. The overflow is a single null byte in the data segment and will overwrite part of a local file descriptor variable, which will not result in code execution. As this is a denial of service we rate this issue as having Important impact.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 16:21:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1176191](show_bug.cgi?id=1176191 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9296 CVE-2014-9294 CVE-2014-9295 CVE-2014-9293 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c15)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-19 20:50:45 UTC  ``` Also note that the privileges yielded by the ntp user are quite limited (ntpd only has the net_bind_service and sys_time capabilities).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-12-20 00:44:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:2025 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-2025.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-12-20 02:40:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:2024 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-2024.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c18)  Vincent Danen    2014-12-20 02:51:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1176037#c19)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-22 02:37:34 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-19.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176035#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 08:56:05 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  Prior to ntp-4.2.7p230 ntp-keygen used a weak seed to prepare a random number generator that was of good quality back in the late 1990s. The random numbers produced was then used to generate symmetric keys. In ntp-4.2.8 we use a current-technology cryptographic random number generator, either RAND_bytes from OpenSSL, or arc4random().   Mitigation: Upgrade to 4.2.7p230 or later.  This vulnerability was discovered in ntp-4.2.6 by Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176035#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 10:07:03 UTC  ``` Upstream change to the NEWS file with details quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1176035#c0):  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=5493dc3dofY6drKJde9W-5O1M3s4eg>  This seems to be the seeding fix applied between 4.2.7p229 and 4.2.7p230:  <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/util/ntp-keygen.c?PAGE=diffs&REV=4eae1b72298KRoBQmX-y8URCiRPH5g>  Upstream bug: <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2666>  There is another recent change in 4.2.8 which makes ntp use OpenSSL or arc4random for key generation: <http://bk1.ntp.org/ntp-dev/?PAGE=patch&REV=548db6ddlELn4rnqUZ4kKGOjvtXwbQ>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1176035#c7)  Huzaifa S.

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto\_recv(),
ctl\_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use
either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the ntp user. Note: the crypto\_recv() flaw requires non-default
configurations to be active, while the ctl\_putdata() flaw, by default, can
only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires
additional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)

It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal
use if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf
configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP
restrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send
ntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)

It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.
This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that
could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is
recommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated
with ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain such keys).
(CVE-2014-9294)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

---

## Updated ntp packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 20 Dec 2014

Modification date: 20 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-9293](CVE-2014-9293.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9294](CVE-2014-9294.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9295](CVE-2014-9295.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9296](CVE-2014-9296.html)

## Description

```
Updated ntp packages fix security vulnerabilities:

If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a
cryptographically-weak default key is generated (CVE-2014-9293).

ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator
with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys (CVE-2014-9294).

A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger
buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto_recv() (when using autokey
authentication), ctl_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer
overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed
with the privilege of the ntpd process (CVE-2014-9295).

A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return
statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered.
This situation may be exploitable by an attacker (CVE-2014-9296).

The ntp package has been patched to fix these issues.

In December 2014, the Network Time Foundation issued a series of security advisories detailing vulnerabilities in ntpd, their network time synchronization daemon. EOS uses this daemon for time synchronization, and a number of customers have contacted Arista Networks to ask whether their switches are affected. EOS is not exposed to these vulnerabilities, provided that users configure NTP through Arista's CLI rather than directly configuring ntpd, and that they do not use the ntp-keygen program to generate MD5 authentication keys.

CVE-2014-9293 (Weak default key in config\_auth()): Not vulnerable.

CVE-2014-9294 (Non-cryptographic random number generator with weak seed used by ntp-keygen to generate symmetric keys): Not vulnerable unless configured to use MD5 authentication for NTP and the MD5 key is generated manually with the ntp-keygen program. Arista EOS does not provide any mechanism for generating the key for NTP authentication. The ntp-key program can only be executed from the bash shell. If a user has generated a key using ntp-keygen from the bash shell the resulting key would be weak in MD5 authentication.

CVE-2014-9295 (Buffer overflows in crypto\_recv(), ctl\_putdata(), and configure()): Not vulnerable.

CVE-2014-9296 (Missing return on error in receive()): Not vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176032#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 08:50:56 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  If no 'auth' key is set in the configuration file, ntpd  would generate a random key on the fly.  There were two problems with this: 1) the generated key was 31 bits in size, and 2) it used the (now weak) ntp_random() function, which was seeded with a 32-bit value and could only provide 32 bits of entropy.  This was sufficient back in the late 1990s when the code was written.  Not today.  Mitigation: Upgrade to 4.2.7p11 or later.  This vulnerability was noticed in ntp-4.2.6 by Neel Mehta of the Google Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176032#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:06:51 UTC  ``` Upstream mentions the issue was fixed in 4.2.7p11.  The following commit from between 4.2.7p10 and 4.2.7p11 seems to remove automatic auth key generation among other changes.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * On December 19, 2014, NTP.org and US-CERT released security advisories for *ntpd* detailing two issues regarding weak cryptographic pseudorandom number generation (PRNG), three buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and an unhandled error condition with an unknown impact. Further, on February 4, 2015, these advisories were updated to include an autokey authentication vulnerability and an IPv6 ACL bypass vulnerability.      The impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product.      For Cisco products, refer to the information provided in the Cisco bug IDs listed in the "Affected Products" section of this document.       Additional information and detailed instructions are available in the Cisco installation, configuration, and maintenance guides for each product. If additional clarification or advice is needed, please contact your support organization.      The vulnerability names and associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs are as follows:   + Weak Default Key in config\_auth()    An issue in the generation of a random key for *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to guess the generated key. The attacker may be able to use it to send *ntpdc* query or configuration requests.         The issue occurs because *ntpd* automatically generates weak keys if no *ntpdc* request authentication key was specified in the *ntp.conf* configuration file. An attacker could exploit this issue by guessing the generated key and matching any configured IP restrictions. An exploit could allow the attacker to send *ntpdc* query or configuration requests.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9293.      The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) considers this a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability. + Noncryptographic Random Number Generator with Weak Seed Used by ntp-keygen to Generate Symmetric Keys    An issue in *ntp-keygen* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to guess the generated MD5 keys.         The issue occurs because *ntp-keygen* uses a weak method for generating the MD5 keys. An attacker could exploit this issue by guessing the generated MD5 keys. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the guessed MD5 keys to spoof a trusted NTP client or server.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9294.      Cisco PSIRT considers this a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability. + Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in ntpd    Vulnerabilities in *crypto\_recv(), ctl\_putdata(),* and *configure()* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a stack buffer overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute malicious code with the privilege level of the *ntpd* process.         The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect validation checks on the received packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted request packets. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the *ntpd* process. Arbitrary code execution with the privilege level of the *ntpd* process may also be possible.      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9295. + ntpd receive(): Missing Return on Error    An issue in *ntp\_proto.c:receive()* of *ntp* in the code path where an error was detected could indicate processing did not stop when a specific rare error occurs.      The issue is due to a missing *return;* in the code path where an error was detected. It has not been proven how an attacker could exploit this issue. The impact to the affected system is also unknown.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9296.      Cisco PSIRT at this stage does not consider this to be a vulnerability. + NTP ntp\_crypto.c Improper Validation Vulnerability    A vulnerability in *ntp\_crypto.c* of *ntpd* could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of *vallen*. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to a device running *ntpd* and configured with autokey authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9297. + NTP IPv6 ACL Bypass Vulnerability    A vulnerability in IPv6 address handling could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to send IPv6 network packets to a vulnerable system using a spoofed source address of **::1** on an interface not configured for localhost.      The vulnerability is due to improper IPv6 address processing. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending IPv6 packets with a source address of **::1** to an affected host. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass application ACLs that rely on IPv6 source address filtering.      This issue has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-9298  Workarounds  * Mitigations involve preventing the device from processing NTP control queries. In products that allow for editing the ntp.conf file, this is accomplished by the **restrict** directive. Other products may support **ntp access-group** commands which can be used to filter NTP control queries. Potential workarounds for each affected Cisco product is referenced in the Cisco Bug ID workarounds section.      Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=36857>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       This section will be populated when investigation of each product has concluded.

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto\_recv(),
ctl\_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use
either of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the ntp user. Note: the crypto\_recv() flaw requires non-default
configurations to be active, while the ctl\_putdata() flaw, by default, can
only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires
additional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)

It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal
use if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf
configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP
restrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send
ntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)

It was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.
This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that
could then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is
recommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated
with ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain such keys.
(CVE-2014-9294)

A missing return statement in the receive() function could potentially
allow a remote attacker to bypass NTP's authentication mechanism.
(CVE-2014-9296)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1176032#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-19 08:50:56 UTC  ``` As per upstream NTP security advisory:  If no 'auth' key is set in the configuration file, ntpd  would generate a random key on the fly.  There were two problems with this: 1) the generated key was 31 bits in size, and 2) it used the (now weak) ntp_random() function, which was seeded with a 32-bit value and could only provide 32 bits of entropy.  This was sufficient back in the late 1990s when the code was written.  Not today.  Mitigation: Upgrade to 4.2.7p11 or later.  This vulnerability was noticed in ntp-4.2.6 by Neel Mehta of the Google Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1176032#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-19 09:06:51 UTC  ``` Upstream mentions the issue was fixed in 4.2.7p11.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
