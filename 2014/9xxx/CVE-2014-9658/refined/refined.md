Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Incorrect minimum table length enforcement in the `tt_face_load_kern` function within `sfnt/ttkern.c` of the FreeType library. The check `length <= 6` was insufficient and didn't account for the full data read later.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Over-read:** The insufficient length check allows the program to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a crafted TrueType font.
*   **Integer Underflow:** When the `length` is too short, a later calculation of `(p_next - p)` can result in an integer underflow, bypassing a check designed to prevent over-reads

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application using FreeType to crash.
*  **Unspecified other impact:** The possibility of arbitrary code execution or information disclosure, though less explicit than DoS, also exists due to the out of bounds read and ability to bypass intended checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted TrueType font:** An attacker can craft a malicious TrueType font file.
*   **Loading the crafted font:** An application using the vulnerable FreeType library would have to process the malicious font.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted font to a target application or system utilizing the vulnerable FreeType library.
*   No special privileges are required as the attack involves processing a crafted font file that would typically be handled by a user-level process.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The fix involved modifying the length check in `src/sfnt/ttkern.c` from `length <= 6` to `length <= 6 + 8` to account for the additional 8 bytes read after the initial check.
*   The integer underflow vulnerability is located in a check of `num_pairs` variable in the same function of freetype2 source code.

**Affected Software:**
*   FreeType versions before 2.5.4

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who can induce a user or process to open a crafted font file which is widely used in many OSes and applications.
