Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in LibreOffice's handling of malformed RTF (Rich Text Format) files. Specifically, during the import process, LibreOffice attempts to write to invalid memory locations when encountering a malformed RTF file. This is further confirmed by Valgrind logs indicating invalid write operations near allocated memory blocks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Invalid Memory Write:** The core issue is an attempt to write data to memory locations that are not valid or allocated for that purpose during the parsing of a malformed RTF file. This could lead to memory corruption.
- **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization/Validation:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate the structure of the incoming RTF file, allowing for the trigger of the invalid write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the LibreOffice application, which constitutes a denial-of-service.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not definitively confirmed, the report suggests the vulnerability is "potentially exploitable for RCE". This suggests the possibility of an attacker crafting a specific RTF file that, when parsed, could overwrite parts of memory in a way that allows them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the LibreOffice process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious RTF File:** The attack vector is a crafted, malformed RTF file.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to open the malicious RTF file using LibreOffice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create Malformed RTF:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an RTF file to contain the specific malformations that trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice or trick a victim into opening the malicious file.
- **No special privileges required:** An attacker could execute this at the user-level.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was initially reported against LibreOffice 3.5.4 running on Debian Stable, but it is fixed in later versions (4.3.3-2 and higher).
- The original report indicates that it was discovered using a fuzzer (zzuf).
- A patch was created to prevent this crash.
- Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-2578-1) addresses this CVE along with another one.
- Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201603-05) lists this CVE as one of several vulnerabilities that are fixed in LibreOffice 4.4.2.
- The bug report on freedesktop.org also has crash files and valgrind logs as attachments.

This information provides more details than the basic CVE description, especially regarding the potential for RCE and the specific conditions under which the vulnerability can be triggered.
