> Crash importing malformed .rtf -- potentially exploitable for RCE

Use CVE-2014-9093 for bug 86449.

(For reference, <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/19/3> is
about finding a series of bugs in version 3.5.4 on Debian stable -- in
other words, a version based on a mid-2012 codebase -- and reporting
them directly upstream without commenting on 4.2.x or 4.3.x.)

For the others, in addition to the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/19/18> post, "Michael
Meeks from officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org indicated that they
are not interested in CVEs for DoS-only crashers" is also relevant.
This has multiple possible interpretations, e.g., "not interested"
because their security team won't track the issues using CVEs, or "not
interested" because they are not vulnerabilities. The "is a security
issue because it takes down all other windows with it" is often
relevant to CVE because it represents a default security policy if
there is no information from a vendor about their security policy.
However, a vendor is free to establish a security policy such as "if
you are working with a potentially untrusted file, you MUST NOT have
any other windows open in which you are maintaining state about your
other editing work." In other words, they can define all DoS-only
crashers to be applicable only in unsupported use cases.

Package        : libreoffice
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9093
Debian Bug     : 771163

It was discovered that LibreOffice, an office productivity suite, could
try to write to invalid memory areas when importing malformed RTF files.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or arbitrary code execution via crafted RTF files.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1:4.3.3-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.

# LibreOffice, OpenOffice: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in both LibreOffice and
OpenOffice allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4.2** |

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4.2** |

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice-bin-debug** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4.2** |

| Package | **app-office/openoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1.2** |

### Background

Apache OpenOffice is the leading open-source office software suite for
word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases and
more.

LibreOffice is a powerful office suite; its clean interface and powerful
tools let you unleash your creativity and grow your productivity.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in both LibreOffice and OpenOffice
that allow the remote execution of arbitrary code and potential Denial of
Service. These vulnerabilities may be exploited through multiple vectors
including crafted documents, link handling, printer setup in ODF document
types, DOC file formats, and Calc spreadsheets. Please review the
referenced CVE’s for specific information regarding each.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using the LibreOffice or OpenOffice suite of software. Execution of
these attacks could possibly result in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

All LibreOffice users should upgrade their respective packages to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.4.2"
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.4.2"# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-debug-4.4.2"

```

All OpenOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-4.1.2"

```

Subject: CVE Request: LibreOffice -- several issues

Hi!

Could CVEs please be assigned to the following issues?

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86446>
Crashes importing malformed .doc -- DoS

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86447>
Crashes importing malformed .ppt -- DoS

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86448>
Crashes importing malformed .rtf -- DoS

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86449>
Crash importing malformed .rtf -- potentially exploitable for RCE

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86451>
Crashes importing malformed .rtf

Tested with LibreOffice 3.5.4 on Debian Stable (amd64).

Found during one evening with zzuf.

IIUC any crasher (or 100% cpu usage) in LO is a security issue because
it takes down all other windows with it. But Michael Meeks from
officesecurity@...ts.freedesktop.org indicated that they are not
interested in CVEs for DoS-only crashers (I haven't asked about RCE)
because they still have 180 crashers in their own testing. All info
about their testing is regularly posted to LO devel mailing list.

# USN-2578-1: LibreOffice vulnerabilities

27 April 2015

LibreOffice could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libreoffice](/security/cves?package=libreoffice) - Office productivity suite

## Details

Alexander Cherepanov discovered that LibreOffice incorrectly handled

certain RTF files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

RTF document, a remote attacker could cause LibreOffice to crash, and

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-9093](/security/CVE-2014-9093))

It was discovered that LibreOffice incorrectly handled certain HWP files.

If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted HWP document, a

remote attacker could cause LibreOffice to crash, and possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1774](/security/CVE-2015-1774))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:4.3.7~rc2-0ubuntu1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A4.3.7~rc2-0ubuntu1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:4.2.8-0ubuntu2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A4.2.8-0ubuntu2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:3.5.7-0ubuntu8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A3.5.7-0ubuntu8)

After a standard system update you need to restart LibreOffice to make all

the necessary changes.
