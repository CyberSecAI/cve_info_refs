Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the D-Link DCS-2103 IP camera:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Brute Force (BF):** The device lacks any protection mechanisms against brute force attacks on the login mechanism.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device's web interface allows for the injection of arbitrary client-side scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Brute Force Vulnerability (WASC-11):** No rate limiting, account lockout, or other protection against repeated login attempts.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability (WASC-08):** Input is not properly sanitized when rendering the web page, allowing the execution of JavaScript code supplied by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Brute Force:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the camera's administrative interface and potentially its video/audio streams.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to hijack user sessions, deface the interface, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Brute Force:** Repeated login attempts against the web interface, targeting user credentials.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code and tricking a user into visiting that URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Brute Force:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the camera's web interface. No prior authentication is needed.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious URLs to other users of the camera's web interface. No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found by "MustLive" in July 2014 and disclosed on December 16, 2014.
*   The affected firmware version is 1.0.0 for both BF and XSS. The BF vulnerability is present in version 1.20 and prior.
*   D-Link allegedly refused to fix the BF vulnerability, stating it's the user's responsibility to have strong passwords.
*   The XSS vulnerability was fixed in firmware version 1.20.
*   The researcher mentions that they had control over web cameras in Ukraine and Russia.
