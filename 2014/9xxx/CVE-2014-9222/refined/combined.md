# The Misfortune Cookie Vulnerability

---

*From*: Shahar Tal <shahartal () checkpoint com>

*Date*: Thu, 18 Dec 2014 14:00:13 +0000

---

```
Hey there,

Recently our group has uncovered a serious vuln in RomPager - the most popular web server in the world, found in
millions of embedded devices (mostly residential gateways / SOHO routers), which unfortunately allows gaining admin
access to the router from the WAN (port 80 access not required! 7547 works like a charm).

This is not the "rom-0" vulnerability revealed earlier this year. In fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse -
IPv4 scans show at least 12 million readily exploitable endpoints. Shodan it yourself later.

We call it "Misfortune Cookie" over the affected vulnerable HTTP cookie parsing module, but MITRE insists on
CVE-2014-9222 (CVSS score, for those of you keeping count, is 9.7).

See <http://mis.fortunecook.ie> for the rest.

Cheers,

Shahar Tal

###### **Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability**

Digi is currently investigating the impact throughout our product line. We currently have not discovered any impact at this time. We will continue to work diligently, and update as soon as we come to a conclusion across the organization.

Jun 14, 2021
###### **FragAttacks - WiFi Fregmentation and Aggregation Attacks**

At this time, Digi is still reviewing these attacks and how they impact our devices. From the nature of the attacks, we do expect that Digi devices will be impacted.

However, it is critical to note that even with these attacks, it has always been DIgi's policy and suggestions that network communication should never rely on the protections and standards of the data layers (WiFi/BlueTooth). Many of these are implemented in HW and can be difficult to change. If good network practices are used, (TLS/Certificates etc), then these vulnerabilities do not lead to any real impact. These vulnerabilites can only become impactful IF other flaws or issues are present.

It is Digi's intent to address these issues so that we preserve our defense in depth strategy to security in our products. Due to the complexity of these issues, we believe we will be able to address these by Q4 of 2021 or sooner if possible.

###### **RIPPLE20 - Multiple vulnerabilities in TRECK TCP/IP embedded software - VU#257161**

Digi has been working with customers since February to install firmware updates to address the issue. Under specific circumstances, it may be possible that these vulnerabilities could lead to a remote code execution via a network based attack without authentication.

# “Misfortune Cookie” – Allegro Software Urges Manufacturers To Maintain Device Security

by [Loren Shade](https://www.allegrosoft.com/resource/author/lshade/ "Posts by Loren Shade")

![Allegro News](data:image/gif;base64... "Allegro News")![Allegro News](https://www.allegrosoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-2-2-Allegro-News-Image-V1.png "Allegro News")
# **Allegro Software Urges Manufacturers To Maintain Firmware for Highest Level of Embedded Device Security**

### **CVE-2014-9222 and CVE-2014-9223 security concerns addressed almost a decade ago**

[PDF](https://www.allegrosoft.com/wp-content/uploads/Allegro-Press-Misfortune-Cookie-2014.pdf)

BOXBOROUGH, MA December 19, 2014 – Allegro Software, a leading supplier of Internet component software for embedded devices, urges manufacturers of network enabled embedded products to maintain the latest release of component software in their products. Since standards based protocols continue to evolve and new networking security concerns continue to be uncovered and addressed, using the latest version of Allegro’s software components is the way that manufacturers can be assured that their products include robust security and the highest levels of compatibility with standards.

An example is the case of the CVE-2014-9222 and CVE-2014-9223 vulnerabilities (also known as Misfortune Cookie). These vulnerabilities were discovered in the RomPager® embedded web server version 4.07, which was released in 2002. Allegro had previously identified, fixed, and released updated software components that addressed these vulnerabilities. RomPager® version 4.34, which resolved these vulnerabilities, was provided to Allegro Software customers in 2005. Allegro has continued to provide updates and enhancements to the RomPager® software, and the latest available version is 5.40.

Unfortunately, not all manufacturers using Allegro Software products have updated their devices with the latest RomPager® software component. In some cases, manufacturers continue to make and sell products with software components that are over 13 years old, which can expose products to security concerns. Allegro Software is a software component supplier to product manufacturers. Allegro Software does not have the ability to upgrade or patch our customer’s manufactured products. If you have a product that is affected by the above security concerns, please contact the product manufacturer to obtain a firmware update.

**“MISFORTUNE COOKIE” VULNERABILITY IN VERSION 4.07 – CVE-2014-9222**

In early 2002, Allegro Software released the RomPager® (v4.07) embedded web server which added support for browser cookies. After the v4.07 release, Allegro identified and fixed a security issue related to the implementation of cookies with the RomPager® (v4.34) release in mid 2005. Since 2005, all new and existing customers under Allegro’s software maintenance program have been provided the latest software so that they can update their products and resolve this security concern.

**DIGEST BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITY IN VERSION 4.07 – CVE-2014-9223**

RomPager® Version 4.07 also included a Digest Authentication buffer overflow vulnerability. This security issue was also identified and addressed in the RomPager® 4.34 software release.

**ONGOING DEVELOPMENT**

Since version 4.34, Allegro Software has continued to invest in embedded device security with ongoing development of our existing products and creation of new products aimed at secure Internet connectivity. These investments have included the creation of the [Allegro Cryptography Engine (ACE™)](https://www.allegrosoft.com/allegro-cryptography-engine), which has received FIPS validation (<http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401val2013.htm#2048>). Allegro’s suite of Advanced Edition toolkits with IPv4/IPv6 capabilities have been fully integrated with ACE™ and is targeted at next-generation embedded systems connectivity with advanced security requirements. “For over 18 years, Allegro has focused on delivering highly reliable software components for embedded systems found in consumer electronics, medical devices, industrial-control applications, military applications and more.” says Bob Van Andel, President of Allegro. “We take embedded device security seriously and want our customer partners to do the same. We strongly urge manufacturers to maintain their firmware with the latest software components to deliver the highest level of Internet communications compatibility and embedded device security to the end customer.”

## Multiple broadband routers use vulnerable versions of Allegro RomPager

#### Vulnerability Note VU#561444

Original Release Date: 2014-12-19 | Last Revised: 2017-05-09

---

### Overview

Multiple broadband routers use vulnerable versions of Allegro RomPager in current firmware releases.

### Description

| Many home and office/home office (SOHO) routers have been found to be using vulnerable versions of the Allegro RomPager embedded web server. Allegro RomPager versions prior to 4.34 contain a vulnerability in cookie processing code that can be leveraged to grant attackers administrative privileges on the device. According to Check Point's [advisory](http://mis.fortunecook.ie/), the vulnerability was [addressed](https://www.allegrosoft.com/allegro-software-urges-manufacturers-to-maintain-firmware-for-highest-level-of-embedded-device-security/news-press.html) by Allegro in 2005 but is present in current or recent firmware releases of many devices. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Check vendor websites for a firmware update that addresses this issue and apply it if available. |
| --- |

| **Use third-party firmware**Technical users may consider flashing to third-party firmware such as that provided by dd-wrt, openwrt, [or others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_router_firmware_projects). Note that this action may invalidate device warranties.**Disable WAN services**If possible, disable services that listen for HTTP or HTTPS connections on the device's WAN side. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Check Point Software Technologies has published a [list of devices](http://mis.fortunecook.ie/misfortune-cookie-suspected-vulnerable.pdf) (PDF) suspected of being vulnerable. We will update the Vendor Information section below as more information becomes available. |

### [Digi International](#JLAD-ALJRQY) Affected

Updated:  May 09, 2017

**Statement Date:   May 08, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Digi has posted the following advisory [here](http://knowledge.digi.com/articles/Knowledge_Base_Article/RomPager-Evaluation-of-Security-Vulnerability-VU-561444-Expanded-info-on-CVE-2014-9222-CVE-2014-9223/):

**Overview:**
Many Digi products contain and use the RomPager by Allegrosoft web server technology. It has come to our attention that this embedded web server, which is used for management of our devices contains what we have defined as a critical vulnerability. We urge any customer who may have one of these products where the administrative webserver is available on non-secure networks to either upgrade the firmware to a patched version or to disable the web server for management of these devices.

**Affected Products:**
ConnectPort TS, Connect ES, Connect SP, Connect N2S, AnywhereUSB, ConnectPort X4, ConnectPort X2, Connect ME, Connect EM, Connect WAN 3G, Connect WAN 3G IA, Net+OS

**History:**
The initial vulnerability was identified a few years ago (Sept 2014), and was evaluated by Digi in consultation with AllegroSoft based the then current understanding of the potential vulnerability, it was concluded that only specific RomPager versions (4.07 to 4.37) were vulnerable to these attacks and that Digi’s implementation in particular did not rely on those versions or features that were potentially impacted.
The current version of RomPager that Digi uses is version 4.01. In re-evaluation of this vulnerability, which includes a working exploit, we can conclude that the earlier information that was provided to us was in error. This vulnerability does indeed exist within the product, and both CVE’s are present in RomPager version 4.01. The CVE-2014-9222 vulnerability can be used to remotely reset admin passwords to gain full access to the devices. For the CVE-2014-9223 vulnerability, this currently can only lead to a denial of service, and a reboot of the device.

**CVE-2014-9222 and CVE-2014-9223:**
These vulnerabilities are known as the misfortune cookie (CVE-2014-9222/9223) vulnerabilities. The vulnerability exists in the cookie processing and authentication digest code, which is included in version 4.01 of our RomPager embedded web server. In our re-evaluation of this, we have deemed this a critical vulnerability for which we have created an immediate patch for affected products that is available online at www.digi.com/support. . We recommend that current customers download and evaluate the latest firmware for your Digi devices that you have deployed. As always, evaluation of risk is up to our end customers based on their deployment environment and change management criteria.

**Evaluation of risk:**
Below are the reasons why we believe this to be a critical vulnerability:
The vulnerability does NOT need any user credentials.
The vulnerability, with a bit of review, is easy to trigger, and has a high degree of success.
All confidentiality and integrity of the device, and devices that are directly connected to are lost.
External exploits are known to exist in the wild, although these exploits only reboot a device at this time.

**Mitigation:**
To mitigate the issue, it is advised to disable the web server on the device. Other device management methods are not impacted (i.e. SSH, and/or Digi Remote Manager).
Other mitigating factors:
Many of the devices may are deployed within a limited access private network. If this is the case, then the customer should conduct their own risk assessment, as having the device isolated may help reduce the risk of this vulnerability. However, if this device is connected directly to the Internet, we highly suggest disabling the web server immediately, at least on any public interfaces.

**Summary:**
With security being a critical part many products in the Internet of Things, we are committed to making sure that our products are safe, and usable within critical infrastructure and other business uses. With vulnerabilities and risks around every corner, we try to take a risk based approach to fixing vulnerabilities where they are needed most, and at the most critical times. Although we try to understand every customer and use of our products, we understand that each customer has to go through their own risk analysis as well with our products. If you believe that the analysis above is missing information, or there is a significant difference in your evaluation of risk, please do not hesitate to contact our Security Office by emailing security@digi.com.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Allegro Software Urges Manufacturers
To Maintain Firmware for Highest Level of Embedded Device Security

CVE-2014-9222 and CVE-2014-9223 security concerns addressed almost a decade ago

BOXBOROUGH, MA December 19, 2014 – Allegro Software, a leading supplier of Internet component

software for embedded devices, urges manufacturers of network enabled embedded products to maintain

the latest release of component software in their products.  Since standards based protocols continue to

evolve and new networking security concerns continue to be uncovered and addressed, using the latest

version of Allegro’s software components is the way that manufacturers can be assured that their products

include robust security and the highest levels of compatibility with standards.

An example is the case of the CVE-2014-9222 and CVE-2014-9223 vulnerabilities (also known as

Misfortune Cookie).  These vulnerabilities were discovered in the RomPager embedded web server

version 4.07, which was released in 2002. Allegro had previously identified, fixed, and released updated

software components that addressed these vulnerabilities.  RomPager version 4.34, which resolved these

vulnerabilities, was provided to Allegro Software customers in 2005. Allegro has continued to provide

updates and enhancements to the RomPager software, and the latest available version is 5.40.

Unfortunately, not all manufacturers using Allegro Software products have updated their devices with the

latest RomPager software component.  In some cases, manufacturers continue to make and sell products

with software components that are over 13 years old, which can expose products to security concerns.

Allegro Software is a software component supplier to product manufacturers. Allegro Software does not

have the ability to upgrade or patch our customer’s manufactured products.  If you have a product that is

affected by the above security concerns, please contact the product manufacturer to obtain a firmware

update.

“MISFORTUNE COOKIE” VULNERABILITY IN VERSION 4.07 – CVE-2014-9222

In early 2002, Allegro Software released the RomPager (v4.07) embedded web server which added

support for browser cookies.   After the v4.07 release, Allegro identified and fixed a security issue related

to the implementation of cookies with the RomPager (v4.34) release in mid 2005.   Since 2005, all new

and existing customers under Allegro’s software maintenance program have been provided the latest

software so that they can update their products and resolve this security concern.

DIGEST BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITY IN VERSION 4.07 – CVE-2014-9223

RomPager Version 4.07 also included a Digest Authentication buffer overflow vulnerability. This security

issue was also identified and addressed in the RomPager 4.34 software release.

ONGOING DEVELOPMENT

Since version 4.34, Allegro Software has continued to invest in embedded device security with ongoing

development of our existing products and creation of new products aimed at secure Internet connectivity.

These investments have included the creation of the Allegro Cryptography Engine (ACE), which has

received FIPS 140-2 validation (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-

1/1401val2013.htm - 2048).  Allegro’s suite of Advanced Edition toolkits with IPv4/IPv6 capabilities

have been fully integrated with ACE and is targeted at next-generation embedded systems connectivity

with advanced security requirements.  “For over 18 years, Allegro has focused on delivering highly

reliable software components for embedded systems found in consumer electronics, medical devices,

industrial-control applications, military applications and more.” says Bob Van Andel, President of

Allegro.  “We take embedded device security seriously and want our customer partners to do the same.

We strongly urge manufacturers to maintain their firmware with the latest software components to deliver

the highest level of Internet communications compatibility and embedded device security to the end

customer.”
