- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a predictable linear pattern of initial sequence numbers in TCP connections initiated by the device. This makes it possible to predict new device connection requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Predictable TCP sequence numbers (CWE-342)
    - Lack of authentication for new socket connections
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This could lead to:
    - System crash
    - Execution of arbitrary code
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation over a network. The device must be Internet-facing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high skill levels to exploit the vulnerability, but no specific positioning is mentioned other than remote network access.
