## Description

Relevanssi replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine, with lots of features and configurable options. You’ll get better results, better presentation of results – your users will thank you.

This is the free version of Relevanssi. There’s also Relevanssi Premium, which has added features. For more information about Premium, see [Relevanssi.com](https://www.relevanssi.com/).

Do note that using Relevanssi may require large amounts (hundreds of megabytes) of database space (for a reasonable estimate, multiply the size of your `wp_posts` database table by three). If your hosting setup has a limited amount of space for database tables, using Relevanssi may cause problems. In those cases use of Relevanssi cannot be recommended.

#### Key features

* Search results sorted in the order of relevance, not by date.
* Fuzzy matching: match partial words, if complete words don’t match.
* Find documents matching either just one search term (OR query) or require all words to appear (AND query).
* Search for phrases with quotes, for example “search phrase”.
* Create custom excerpts that show where the hit was made, with the search terms highlighted.
* Highlight search terms in the documents when user clicks through search results.
* Search comments, tags, categories and custom fields.
* Multisite friendly.
* bbPress support.
* Gutenberg friendly.

#### Advanced features

* Adjust the weighting for titles, tags and comments.
* Log queries, show most popular queries and recent queries with no hits.
* Restrict searches to categories and tags using a hidden variable or plugin settings.
* Index custom post types and custom taxonomies.
* Index the contents of shortcodes.
* Google-style “Did you mean?” suggestions based on successful user searches.
* Support for [WPML multi-language plugin](http://wpml.org/) and [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/).
* Support for [s2member membership plugin](http://www.s2member.com/), [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/), [Groups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/), [Simple Membership](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-membership/) and other membership plugins.
* Advanced filtering to help hacking the search results the way you want.
* Search result throttling to improve performance on large databases.
* Disable indexing of post content and post titles with a simple filter hook.

#### Premium features (only in Relevanssi Premium)

* Indexing attachment content (PDF, Office, Open Office).
* Improved spelling correction in “Did you mean?” suggestions.
* Searching across multiple sites in the same multisite installation.
* Search and index user profiles.
* Search and index taxonomy term pages (categories, tags, custom taxonomies).
* Search and index arbitrary columns in wp\_posts MySQL table.
* Assign weights to any post types and taxonomies.
* Assign extra weight to new posts.
* Let the user choose between AND and OR searches, use + and – operator (AND and NOT).
* Export and import settings.
* [WP CLI commands](https://www.relevanssi.com/user-manual/wp-cli/).
* [Related posts](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/related-posts/).
* [Redirects for searches](https://www.relevanssi.com/user-manual/redirects/).

## Installation

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress plugin screen.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to the plugin settings page and build the index following the instructions there.
4. That’s it!

Relevanssi uses the standard search form and doesn’t usually need any changes in the search results template.

If the search does not bring any results, your theme probably has a query\_posts() call in the search results template. That throws Relevanssi off. For more information, see [The most important Relevanssi debugging trick](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/query_posts/).

#### Uninstalling

To uninstall the plugin remove the plugin using the normal WordPress plugin management tools (from the Plugins page, first Deactivate, then Delete). If you remove the plugin files manually, the database tables and options will remain.

## FAQ

### Knowledge Base

You can find solutions and answers at the [Relevanssi Knowledge Base](https://www.relevanssi.com/category/knowledge-base/).

### Contextual help

Answers to many common problems can be found from the contextual menu. Just click “Help” in the top right corner of your WordPress admin dashboard on the Relevanssi settings page.

### Relevanssi doesn’t work

If you the results don’t change after installing and activating Relevanssi, the most likely reason is that you have a call to `query_posts()` on your search results template. This confuses Relevanssi. Try removing the `query_posts()` call and see what happens.

### Searching for words with ampersands or hyphens doesn’t work

Please read [Words with punctuation can’t be found](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/). This is a Relevanssi feature, but you can fix it from Relevanssi indexing settings.

### Where are the user search logs?

See the top of the admin menu. There’s ‘User searches’.

### Displaying the relevance score

Relevanssi stores the relevance score it uses to sort results in the $post variable. Just add something like

```
echo $post->relevance_score

```

to your search results template inside a PHP code block to display the relevance score.

### Did you mean? suggestions

Relevanssi offers Google-style “Did you mean?” suggestions. See [“Did you mean” suggestions](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/did-you-mean-suggestions/) in the Knowledge Base for more details.

### What is tf \* idf weighing?

It’s the basic weighing scheme used in information retrieval. Tf stands for *term frequency* while idf is *inverted document frequency*. Term frequency is simply the number of times the term appears in a document, while document frequency is the number of documents in the database where the term appears.

Thus, the weight of the word for a document increases the more often it appears in the document and the less often it appears in other documents.

### What are stop words?

Each document database is full of useless words. All the little words that appear in just about every document are completely useless for information retrieval purposes. Basically, their inverted document frequency is really low, so they never have much power in matching. Also, removing those words helps to make the index smaller and searching faster.

We bought Premium yesterday and by the end of today we were able to do a proof of concept for a news archive we are putting together.  In one day of development I was able to put together a page of pdf’s with mixed Lithuanian and English text.  I was able to restrict the search on the page to a few categories and exclude unrelated pages on the site.
Your documentation on the modifications required to the functions.php file was really good and I was able to make the changes even though I don’t know php.
We will be moving to multisite in future and I am confident we will be able to port this to the new site without difficulty. Thanks, Mikko!

I was really impressed by the quick support from the plugin team; Relevanssi Search has greatly improved the search functionality on my WordPress site. It provides more accurate and relevant results than the default search, with features like custom post type indexing and partial matching.Thanks to the developer(s)

I had a pleasure of using this plugin for some time and it was great. Fantastic functionality and as I recently found it also has fantastic support from plugin authors (Mikko specifically). I hope I can go for a premium version of the plugin for my future project.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
