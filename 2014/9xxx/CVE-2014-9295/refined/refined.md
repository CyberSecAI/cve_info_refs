  "response": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows exist in the ntpd functions `crypto_recv()`, `ctl_putdata()`, and `configure()` due to incorrect validation checks on received packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflows"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets to trigger buffer overflows, which may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege level of the `ntpd` process, potentially crashing the process. In some cases, information leaks or denial of service may also result.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted network packets"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker. For the `crypto_recv()` overflow, Autokey Authentication must be enabled.  For the `ctl_putdata()` overflow, remote access via untrusted host is needed .  For the `configure()` overflow, additional authentication is required.",
     "additional_details": "The `crypto_recv()` overflow is triggered when Autokey Authentication is enabled, `ctl_putdata()` is vulnerable when control messages are not restricted to trusted hosts (localhost), and the `configure()` overflow is caused by a length check failure, which can lead to overwriting of part of the local file descriptor variable during a remote configuration change."
