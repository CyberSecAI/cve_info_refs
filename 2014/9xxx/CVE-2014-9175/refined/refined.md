Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-9175

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The `table_id` parameter in the `wpdatatables.php` file is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `wdt_get_ajax_data` function retrieves the `table_id` from the `$_GET` array without any sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `table_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to the database, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data.
* The attacker can also potentially gain control over the underlying system by using SQL injection techniques to execute operating system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability is exposed through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint of WordPress, which processes AJAX requests.
* The vulnerable parameter is `table_id`, passed via the GET method.
* The vulnerable code is located in the `wdt_get_ajax_data` function within `wpdatatables.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress installation.
* No authentication is needed, as the vulnerability exists within a function called with both `wp_ajax_get_wdtable` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_get_wdtable`, where the latter can be used unauthenticated.
* The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query and inject it via the `table_id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects WordPress wpDataTables plugin version 1.5.3 and below.
* The provided content includes PoC (Proof of Concept) and sqlmap usage examples to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is exploitable using both blind boolean and time-based SQL injection techniques.
