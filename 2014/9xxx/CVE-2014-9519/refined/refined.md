The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the InfiniteWP Admin Panel, which are not described in the CVE.

**Vulnerability 1:**
*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated SQL injection in `login.php` due to unsanitized user-controlled `email` parameter.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper input sanitization/escaping in the `filterParameters()` function when `DBEscapeString` is set to false, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:**  Remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access or data manipulation.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP request to `login.php` with a crafted `email` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 2:**
*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated SQL injection in `execute.php` due to unsanitized user-controlled parameters `historyID` and `actionID` in a SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization/escaping in the `filterParameters()` function when `DBEscapeString` is set to false, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access or data manipulation.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP request to `execute.php` with crafted `historyID` and `actionID` parameters.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 3:**
*   **Root Cause:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in `uploadScript.php`.
*  **Weakness:**  Unauthenticated users can upload files, including .php files, to the uploads directory with the `allWPFiles` parameter set. Files are suffixed with `.swp`. If the webserver is configured to interpret `.php.swp` files as PHP, it results in code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially gaining full control of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP request to `uploadScript.php` with a crafted file and the `allWPFiles` parameter set.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable application. Additionally, the web server must interpret `.php.swp` files as PHP. The uploads directory also has to be writable by the webserver user.

**Vulnerability 4:**
*   **Root Cause:** Insecure password storage using unsalted SHA1 hashes.
*   **Weakness:** Passwords are not salted before hashing, making them vulnerable to cracking using rainbow tables or other techniques.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can easily crack admin passwords, allowing them to maintain access to the admin panel even after security updates are applied.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Compromise the `iwp_users.password` table and attempt to crack the password hashes offline.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Requires access to the database where the password hashes are stored.
