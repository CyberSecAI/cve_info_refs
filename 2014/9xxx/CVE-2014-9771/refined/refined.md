Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow within the `_imlib_SaveImage` function in the `imlib2` library. This overflow occurs when handling image dimensions during the saving process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow, which happens when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that the data type can hold. In this case, the overflow leads to incorrect memory calculations.
*   **Invalid Memory Access:** The integer overflow results in an invalid memory read operation.
*  **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** Integer overflows can lead to allocating much less memory than expected, or alternatively much more. The vulnerability can lead to an insufficient heap allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by causing a crash of the application that uses the `imlib2` library. This can occur due to the invalid memory access.
*   **Memory Consumption:** The vulnerability can lead to excessive memory consumption if an attacker manages to influence the size of memory allocation.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, due to the insufficient heap allocation and out-of-bounds memory write, exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image:** The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted image file to an application that utilizes the `imlib2` library. This image is designed to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:**  An attacker can exploit this remotely by delivering a malicious image to a vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required.
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:**  The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted image to the affected software. This could be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means of delivering image data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `imlib2` versions prior to 1.4.7.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a "moderate" severity by SUSE.
*   Patches are available to address the vulnerability
*   This vulnerability has been fixed in various Linux distributions including openSUSE, Debian, and Red Hat based distributions.
*   The issue has been addressed with a commit upstream: `<https://git.enlightenment.org/legacy/imlib2.git/commit/?id=143f299>`

This information is extracted from multiple sources including the SUSE CVE page, Debian bug reports, and Red Hat bug reports. These confirm the integer overflow in `_imlib_SaveImage` as the root cause and its potential for DoS and memory corruption.
