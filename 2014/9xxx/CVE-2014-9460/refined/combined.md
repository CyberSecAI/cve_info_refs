## Description

WP-ViperGB is a WordPress plugin designed to replicate the appearance and behavior of the discontinued [Viper Guestbook](http://www.vipergb.de.vu/) project. It makes it easy to add a stylish and user-friendly guestbook to your blog.

Features:

* Create user-friendly guestbooks without writing a single line of code.
* Lives in a standard WordPress page and uses comments for entries, so moderation and antispam functionality works as normal.
* Two-View layout provides one view for submitting entries and another for reading them.
* Automatic paging of entries to customizable length.
* Show icons for country, browser, and OS in visitor signatures.
* Admin-panel stylesheet selector allows easy skinning to suit your theme.
* No bloat: Uses existing WordPress faculties so no custom database tables are required.
* Simple PHP template function allows programmers to manually embed standalone guestbooks in any template they wish.

For a Demo, see the [plugin’s homepage](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-vipergb#demo).

### Donate

Many hours have gone into developing & maintaining this plugin, far beyond my own personal needs. If you find it useful, [a donation](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-vipergb/#donate) would be greatly appreciated.

### Privacy

This plugin uses standard WordPress comments for its entries – it is essentially a fancy whole-page comment form skin. It does not collect any data beyond that which would normally be included in standard WordPress comments. Please refer to the WordPress documentation for details on what information is stored with comments.

### Support

Please direct all support requests [here](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-vipergb#feedback)

## Installation

1. Download the most recent version of the plugin from [here](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-vipergb/), unzip it, and upload the extracted files to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Login to your WordPress admin panel and activate the plugin.
3. Create a new Page (i.e. “Guestbook”).
4. Navigate to Settings -> WP-ViperGB.

Decent Guestbook but it doesn’t have enough controls to customize the options. I’ve been using it for a couple years now but recently noticed a Huge influx of Spam comments coming in from those who are only wanting to use their website as a back link. I wish there was an option to restrict people from posting their own website. Even the ability to use a Capcha would be helpful. I hope to see an update one day with some upgrades.
