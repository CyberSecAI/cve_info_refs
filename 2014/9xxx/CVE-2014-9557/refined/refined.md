Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the SmartCMS v.2 application. Specifically, the `pageid` and `lang` parameters in `index.php` and `sitemap.php` are not being properly handled, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, categorized as CWE-79. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage seen by the user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Injecting code to download and execute malware on the user's system.
    *   **Information Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters `pageid` and `lang` in the `index.php` and `sitemap.php` pages.
*   An attacker can craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript code within these parameters.
*   Victims would trigger the exploit by clicking on the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or credentials.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and distribute them to potential victims through methods like:
    *   Social engineering (e.g., sending malicious links via email or social media).
    *   Compromising a website and injecting the malicious URLs there.
    *   Utilizing other vulnerabilities to inject the code into the website.
    *   Tricking users into visiting links under their control.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in SmartCMS v.2's failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input in the `pageid` and `lang` parameters of `index.php` and `sitemap.php`. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the browsers of users who visit those pages with the crafted URLs. This can have serious consequences, such as user account compromise, phishing, and malware distribution.
