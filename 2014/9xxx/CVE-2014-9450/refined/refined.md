Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `chart_bar.php` file of the Zabbix frontend. The code takes user-supplied `itemid` values from GET, POST, or COOKIE parameters without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `itemid` is taken from user input and used directly within an SQL query in line 174. Although the code uses `intval()` to cast the value, this check is not applied on the array itself, allowing a malicious user to inject SQL code within the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker could manipulate the `$itemid` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.
- **Data Breaches:** This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the Zabbix database.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to the system or escalate privileges by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST/COOKIE parameters:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `items` parameter passed via a GET, POST, or COOKIE request to `chart_bar.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Zabbix frontend.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `chart_bar.php` at line 174.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.8.22, 2.0.14, 2.2.8, and 2.3.4 of Zabbix.
- This vulnerability was classified as 'Critical'.
