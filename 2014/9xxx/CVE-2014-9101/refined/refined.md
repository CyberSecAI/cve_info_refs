Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in Oxwall 1.7.0. The application does not adequately check the validity of HTTP requests, particularly POST requests, allowing malicious actions to be performed. Also, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application allows actions to be performed via HTTP requests without proper validation, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This means an attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend, potentially with administrative privileges.
*   **Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input passed through several POST parameters is not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and script code that will be executed in the user's browser, within the context of the vulnerable site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can perform administrative actions if a logged-in administrator visits a malicious website. This includes creating new user roles and altering existing configurations and settings.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the browser of a user who views the malicious content. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF:**  The attacker crafts malicious HTML forms (as seen in the provided PoC) that, when loaded by a logged-in user, make requests to the vulnerable application.
*  **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious HTML/script code through POST parameters that are not properly sanitized, leading to stored XSS when the data is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **CSRF:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to host a website or control a website visited by the target user.
    *   The target user must be logged into the vulnerable Oxwall application.
*   **XSS:**
    * The attacker needs to find an injection point (POST parameter).
    * The injected code is stored and executed when other users view the malicious content.

**Additional details:**
*   The provided exploit demonstrates several specific vulnerable forms within the Oxwall application.
*   The vulnerability affects Oxwall version 1.7.0 (build 7907 and 7906).
*   The exploit was tested on Kali Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL as specified in the content.
