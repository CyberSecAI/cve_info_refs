Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `do_double_fault` function in `arch/x86/kernel/traps.c` did not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Stack Segment Faults:** The core issue is the incorrect handling of #SS (Stack Segment) faults, specifically related to the way the kernel manages control flow during these exceptions.
*   **Incorrect Stack Usage:** The kernel might use an incorrect or uninitialized stack pointer when such a fault occurs, leading to memory access problems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A local user can cause a system panic (denial of service) by triggering the vulnerability. This was demonstrated by the `sigreturn_32` test.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Although not directly stated in all sources, the issue is related to the manipulation of segment registers, which could potentially have implications for privilege escalation in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Crafted System Call:** Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted `modify_ldt` system call, as shown in the original report and the Suse advisory.
*   **`sigreturn_32` Example:** A specific way to trigger this involves abusing a `sigreturn_32` call, which is a way for a 32-bit program to return from a signal handler.
*   **Malicious LDT:** Maliciously crafting the LDT (Local Descriptor Table) to trigger an invalid SS segment register could also lead to triggering the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to have a local user account to execute code or system calls on the affected machine.
*  **Ability to Make System Calls:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted system call like `modify_ldt`.
*   **Understanding of x86 Architecture:** While not strictly necessary for using the exploit, a good understanding of the x86 architecture and its memory segmentation mechanism, particularly segment registers and LDT entries, would greatly assist in crafting an exploit.

**Additional Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability exists because the kernel fails to properly save or restore the context on a Stack Segment fault, particularly when the espfix64 code is involved or on a failed `iret` to userspace.
* The vulnerability is specific to the x86_64 architecture as per the description.
* The root cause involves the usage of an Interrupt Stack Table (IST).
* This vulnerability is related to how the kernel handles the `IRET` instruction.
* Specifically, the `do_double_fault` handler does not properly set the necessary context to handle an SS fault, particularly in how it relates to switching stacks and restoring registers from the correct context

**Affected Products:**
The content identifies that this issue affects SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Extension 11 SP3, and other SUSE and openSUSE products.

**Mitigation**

The described security update provides fixes to the vulnerable part of the kernel.
