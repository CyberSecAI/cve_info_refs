thanks for plugin !
i wish there was a possibility to leave the “title” field blank.
in actual release if you don’t fill anything in the field, the plugin name is displayed there.
it is also impossible to use ‘ or ” in the title field.
p.s. let me know if you fix this, i will update my review

I reviewed about 20 facebook like buttons today to try and find one I “liked” myself (pun intended). This was my second favorite, it’s truly free, nice and simple, worked fine and the interface is fairly standard (ie: no silly fonts/images/adds. You don’t need to use any short codes. The settings in this app seem to appear in many apps, so I am assuming it’s using some standard facebook template etc.
The main reason I didn’t use it was because I wanted my button aligned to the right, and there didn’t seem to be an option for that. Also I had to mess about a little to stop the widget (side bar) cutting off the bottom of the box.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
