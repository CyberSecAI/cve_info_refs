  "CVE-2014-9970": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Jasypt compares password hashes, making it susceptible to timing attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability in password hash comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially use timing analysis to determine the correct password hash, which can lead to unauthorized access.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Timing analysis of password hash comparison"
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to perform multiple password authentication attempts and measure the time it takes for each attempt."
  }
