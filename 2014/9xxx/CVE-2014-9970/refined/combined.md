RHSA-2017:2810 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2017-09-26
# RHSA-2017:2810 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil class of Picketlink replaces special strings for obtaining attribute values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the "InResponseTo" field in the response. (CVE-2017-2582)
* It was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue(). (CVE-2017-7536)

The CVE-2017-2582 issue was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-7536 issue was discovered by Gunnar Morling (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1443592#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-19 14:13:57 UTC  ```  In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.

Mitigation:  Mitigation to this problem is to not trigger polymorphic desrialization globally by using: objectMapper.enableDefaultTyping() and rather use @JsonTypeInfo on the class property to explicitly define the type information.

However the affected code is NOT used at this time:  Candlepin currently uses the default type resolution configuration for the ObjectMappers it creates/uses. Nowhere in candlepin do we enable global polymorphic deserialization via enableDefaultTyping(...), therefore based on the documentation sited [BZ 1462702](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7525 jackson-databind: Deserialization vulnerability via readValue method of ObjectMapper") , candlepin should not be affected.  However as the vulnerable software ships with the product we have marked them as vulnerable to ensure the issue is tracked.  JBoss EAP 7.x only uses the vulnerable Jackson Databind library for marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON objects passed to JAX-RS webservices. Some advise about how to remain safe when using JAX-RS webservices on JBoss EAP 7.x is available here:   <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231>  Although JBoss Fuse ships the vulnerable version of jackson-databind, it does not call on enableDefaultTyping() for any polymorphic deserialization operations which is the root cause of this vulnerability. We have raised a Jira tracker to ensure that jackson-databind will be upgraded for Fuse 7.0, however due to feasibility issues jackson-databind cannot be upgraded in JBoss Fuse 6.3.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c58)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-30 15:18:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.3  Via RHSA-2019:0910 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0910](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0910)   ```  [Comment 70](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c70)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-27 00:13:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2858)   ```  [Comment 71](show_bug.cgi?id=1462702#c71)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-18 19:52:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:3149 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3149](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3149)   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2811)

## Topic

An update for eap7-jboss-ec2-eap is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The eap7-jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

With this update, the eap7-jboss-ec2-eap package has been updated to ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8.

Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8 Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil class of Picketlink replaces special strings for obtaining attribute values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the "InResponseTo" field in the response. (CVE-2017-2582)
* It was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue(). (CVE-2017-7536)

The CVE-2017-2582 issue was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-7536 issue was discovered by Gunnar Morling (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

# RHSA-2017:2546 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.5 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.5 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.4, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* An XXE vulnerability was found in Apache Batik which could allow a remote attacker to retrieve the files on the vulnerable server's filesystem by uploading specially crafted SVG images. The vulnerability could also allow a denial of service condition by performing an amplification attack. (CVE-2017-5662)

Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

# RHSA-2018:0294 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 is now available for download from the Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on Infinispan.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)
* It was found that the Hotrod client in Infinispan would unsafely read deserialized data on information from the cache. An authenticated attacker could inject a malicious object into the data cache and attain deserialization on the client, and possibly conduct further attacks. (CVE-2017-15089)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)

Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525 and Man Yue Mo (Semmle/lgtm.com) for reporting CVE-2017-15089.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil class of Picketlink replaces special strings for obtaining attribute values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the "InResponseTo" field in the response. (CVE-2017-2582)
* It was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue(). (CVE-2017-7536)

The CVE-2017-2582 issue was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-7536 issue was discovered by Gunnar Morling (Red Hat).

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil class of Picketlink replaces special strings for obtaining attribute values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the "InResponseTo" field in the response. (CVE-2017-2582)
* It was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue(). (CVE-2017-7536)

The CVE-2017-2582 issue was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-7536 issue was discovered by Gunnar Morling (Red Hat).

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BRMS.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.5 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.4, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* An XXE vulnerability was found in Apache Batik which could allow a remote attacker to retrieve the files on the vulnerable server's filesystem by uploading specially crafted SVG images. The vulnerability could also allow a denial of service condition by performing an amplification attack. (CVE-2017-5662)

Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525.

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

## Synopsis

Important: rhvm-appliance security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3141)

## Topic

An update for rhvm-appliance is now available for RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The RHV-M Virtual Appliance automates the process of installing and configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. The appliance is available to download as an OVA file from the Customer Portal.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rhvm-appliance (20171019.0). (BZ#1496586)

Security Fix(es):

* A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)
* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)
* It was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue(). (CVE-2017-7536)

Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525. The CVE-2017-7536 issue was discovered by Gunnar Morling (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-06-27 16:26:07 UTC  ```  A vulnerability which allows for a potential privilege escalation was found in the Hibernate Validator. If a security manager is present and HV itself is allowed to access private members reflectively as per the SM's configuration, that'll allow calling code without that permission to get hold of private state. The attack vector is to declare a constraint on a private member using XML, validate an invalid instance of that type and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-06-27 16:26:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Gunnar Morling (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c2)  Gunnar Morling    2017-07-06 13:10:27 UTC  ``` Hi, we'd like to know how to proceed in this matter. Specifically we are about to release Hibernate Validator 6 (the reference implementation of Bean Validation 2.0) soon. Can we provide a fix for that issue in this new major version at this point in time? Our plan is to check for a specific permission which the caller must possess in order to validate constraints on private members when a security manager is enabled. We'd like to be sure though whether we can provide this solution while this bug record for Hibernate Validator 5.x still is open. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c11)  Jason Shepherd    2017-09-07 03:30:33 UTC  ``` Red Hat Mobile Platform Millicore component does run with a security manager enabled, marking it as not affected.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-26 17:59:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.8  Via RHSA-2017:2810 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2810](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2810)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-26 18:42:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:2808 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2808](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2808)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-26 18:54:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:2809 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2809](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2809)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-26 19:16:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 7   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:2811 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2811](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2811)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-11-07 17:32:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7  Via RHSA-2017:3141 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3141](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3141)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-13 17:36:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2017:3456 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3456](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3456)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-13 18:28:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:3454 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3454](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3454)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-13 18:44:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:3455 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3455](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3455)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-13 18:54:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 for RHEL 7   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:3458 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3458](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3458)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1465573#c21)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2017-12-28 08:57:57 UTC  ``` Hi  Would it be possible to indicate where the issue was fixed?
