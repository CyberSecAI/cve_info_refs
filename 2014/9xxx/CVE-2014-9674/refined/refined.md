    "description": "Multiple integer overflow flaws and an integer signedness flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the way FreeType handled Mac fonts. If a specially crafted font file was loaded by an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",

    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash), potential arbitrary code execution with user privileges, disclosure of a heap pointer for bypassing ASLR",
