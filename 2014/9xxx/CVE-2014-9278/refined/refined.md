{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-9278",
  "description": "It was found that when OpenSSH was used in a Kerberos environment, remote authenticated users were allowed to log in as a different user if they were listed in the ~/.k5users file of that user, potentially bypassing intended authentication restrictions.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A patch in Fedora and downstreams added support for `~/.k5users` which unexpectedly allowed remote authenticated users to log in as another user if they were listed in the `~/.k5users` file of that user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The implementation of `~/.k5users` for remote logins allowed bypassing intended authentication restrictions."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote, authenticated users could log in as another user if they were listed in that user's `~/.k5users` file, potentially bypassing intended authentication restrictions.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A remote attacker with valid Kerberos credentials could log into an account if they are listed in the `~/.k5users` file of the target account."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs valid Kerberos credentials and must be listed in the `~/.k5users` file of the target user."
