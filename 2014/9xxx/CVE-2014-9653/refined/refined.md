  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-9653",
    "description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way file parsed Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause file to crash, disclose portions of its memory, or consume an excessive amount of system resources.",
    "affected_component": "file utility",
    "root_cause": "The file utility did not limit the number of ELF notes processed, leading to potential resource exhaustion. Specifically, the vulnerability exists because of a missing check in how the File Information (fileinfo) extension parsed Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files, particularly when handling ELF notes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of service",
      "Memory disclosure",
        "Resource consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could crash the application, potentially disclose portions of the server's memory, or exhaust system resources leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ELF file that contains a large number of notes to the 'file' utility or a PHP application using fileinfo.",
      "attacker_requirements": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed ELF file to the affected 'file' utility or a PHP application using fileinfo. No specific position or high privileges are required."
