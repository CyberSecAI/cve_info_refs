How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=912214#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-08 10:32:00 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-9556   Jakub Wilk originally reported to the Debian BTS a problem with cabextract on a specially crafted cab file, causing cabextract to hang forever. The problem is actually in the embedded copy of libmspack, see [1]. Libmspack, a library to provide compression and decompression of some file formats used by Microsoft, is used in many project (or embedded there like also Clamav). This issue can cause a remotely exploitable denial-of-service condition due to clamav thread hanging forever while scanning the file. A patch is available at [2] for libmspack.

It's definitely an infinite loop.  It gets caught in qtmd_decompress()
and never gets out of the loop on line 290.

The problem seems to be on this line:

    /* decode more, up to the number of bytes needed, the frame boundary,
     * or the window boundary, whichever comes first */
    frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));

out_bytes is an off_t (8 bytes) but frame_end is an unsigned int (4
bytes) and it overflows.

If I change the "unsigned int" to "off_t" in the first line of this
function, the function terminates properly and declares the file
corrupt:

marvin% ./cabextract ~/Download/hang.cab
Extracting cabinet: /home/sharkey/Download/hang.cab
  extracting limerick
limerick: error in CAB data format

All done, errors in processing 1 file(s)

Stuart, is this the right fix in your opinion?

Eric

This issue also affects libmspack. I noticed this while clamav was
scanning Jakub's mail for malware and it was stuck in an infinite loop.

The issue is easy to reproduce with the crafted file and the following
example code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <mspack.h>

int main()
{
  struct mscab_decompressor *cabd;
  struct mscabd_cabinet *cab;
  struct mscabd_file *file;
  int test;

  MSPACK_SYS_SELFTEST(test);
  if (test != MSPACK_ERR_OK) exit(0);
  if ((cabd = mspack_create_cab_decompressor(NULL))) {
    if ((cab = cabd->open(cabd, "hang.cab"))) {
      for (file = cab->files; file; file = file->next) {
        printf("%s\n", file->filename);
        cabd->extract(cabd, file, file->filename);
      }
      cabd->close(cabd, cab);
    }
    mspack_destroy_cab_decompressor(cabd);
  }
  return 0;
}

(From <https://github.com/cooljeanius/libmspack/blob/master/README> with a
call to extract added.)

Thanks for the backtrace!

As it shows that clamd hangs in libmspack, I think this is bug #773041
[1]. A possible fix is mentioned in [2]. We'll have to include it in the
libmspack copy embedded in clamav, which is used in wheezy.

Best regards,
Andreas

Oh great. So for clamav we have to fix it stable since sid uses the
external library (jay!).
This "type fix" does not look that bad. Do we wait for the upstream
maintainer on this atm?

Is the security team aware of the various in-tree copy of this library?

I can upload this simple fix quickly, nevertheless i did not have time
to proofread it. Any comment?

Joss filled #675560 tagged security.

I tested the cabextract build using the library but had no reply. I
wanted to have at least one real user for the lib before pinging the
other related packages. I should probably have been more aggressive on
this front, my bad.

It would be nice if we could keep this in sync. I will look at this in
tonight at the latest and give more feedback.

Yes. Atleast clamav can be triggered via remote. Not sure about the
others.

I plan to add the following patch to clamav. I added a small comment
why we have the busy loop there. So far it looks like a good idea. The
only problem is that we need off_t beeing 64bit (LFS) or it won't work
on 32bit. No problem on Debian side…

I added upstream on CC hoping that they will take this or do something
about it :)

If nobody objects, I push this tomorrow into the clamav repo.

Subject: [PATCH] make frame_end off_t

Debian bts #773041, #772891 contains a report of a .cab file which
causes an endless loop.
Eric Sharkey diagnosed the problem as frame_end is 32bit and overflows
and the result the loop makes no progress. He also added that making
it off_t (and so 64bit with LFS) fixes the problem.

The problem seems that after the overflow, window_posn is larger than
frame_end and therefore we never enter the loop to make progress. But we
still have out_bytes >0 so we don't leave the outer loop either.

This patch is based on Eric Sharkey comments.

I think there is a better way than changing the type of frame_end to off_t.
It is possible to avoid the overflow by reordering the code:

--- libmspack-0.4.orig/mspack/qtmd.c
+++ libmspack-0.4/mspack/qtmd.c
@@ -296,10 +296,12 @@ int qtmd_decompress(struct qtmd_stream *

     /* decode more, up to the number of bytes needed, the frame boundary,
      * or the window boundary, whichever comes first */
-    frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));
-    if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < frame_end) {
+    if (frame_todo < (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr))) {
       frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
     }
+    else {
+      frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));
+    }
     if (frame_end > qtm->window_size) {
       frame_end = qtm->window_size;
     }

This works, because frame_todo is at most QTM_FRAME_SIZE = 32768.

Merry Christmas,
Andreas

Even better, I like it. The patch at the end of the email is what I
pushed into the wheezy branch for clamav [0]. So after an upload for
stable, we have Wheezy fixed. I have no idea how to close this bug for
unstable since it has to be fixed in a different package. Probably
manually with a comment…
Side question: In case someone has unattended-upgrades running, how does
he get clamd restarted after a libmspack update?

Eric Sharkey diagnosed the problem as frame_end is 32bit and overflows

Andreas Cadhalpun suggested to instead makeing frame_end 64bit, we could
avoid the overflow by reordering the code the following way:

original, with just out_bytes (without (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr))
| frame_end = window_posn + out_bytes;
| if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < frame_end) {
|         frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
| }

replace frame_end in "if" with its content (and move the first frame_end
into the else path)
| if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < (window_posn + out_bytes))
|         frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
| else
|         frame_end = window_posn + out_bytes;

Yes, thanks.

I'm marking the unstable version as not affected, because we have #773041
to track the progress for libmspack. So the upload of the fixed wheezy
version will close this bug.

I think needrestart can do that.

Best regards,

Subject: CVE Request: libmspack: frame_end overflow which could cause
 infinite loop

Hi,

Jakub Wilk originally reported to the Debian BTS a problem with
cabextract on a specially crafted cab file, causing cabextract to hang
forever. The problem is actually in the embedded copy of libmspack, see
[1]. Libmspack, a library to provide compression and decompression of
some file formats used by Microsoft, is used in many project (or
embedded there like also Clamav). This issue can cause a remotely
exploitable denial-of-service condition due to clamav thread hanging
forever while scanning the file. A patch is available at [2] for
libmspack.

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in libmspack?

It's definitely an infinite loop.  It gets caught in qtmd_decompress()
and never gets out of the loop on line 290.

The problem seems to be on this line:

    /* decode more, up to the number of bytes needed, the frame boundary,
     * or the window boundary, whichever comes first */
    frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));

out_bytes is an off_t (8 bytes) but frame_end is an unsigned int (4
bytes) and it overflows.

If I change the "unsigned int" to "off_t" in the first line of this
function, the function terminates properly and declares the file
corrupt:

marvin% ./cabextract ~/Download/hang.cab
Extracting cabinet: /home/sharkey/Download/hang.cab
  extracting limerick
limerick: error in CAB data format

All done, errors in processing 1 file(s)

Stuart, is this the right fix in your opinion?

Eric

This issue also affects libmspack. I noticed this while clamav was
scanning Jakub's mail for malware and it was stuck in an infinite loop.

The issue is easy to reproduce with the crafted file and the following
example code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <mspack.h>

int main()
{
  struct mscab_decompressor *cabd;
  struct mscabd_cabinet *cab;
  struct mscabd_file *file;
  int test;

  MSPACK_SYS_SELFTEST(test);
  if (test != MSPACK_ERR_OK) exit(0);
  if ((cabd = mspack_create_cab_decompressor(NULL))) {

Thanks for the backtrace!

As it shows that clamd hangs in libmspack, I think this is bug #773041
[1]. A possible fix is mentioned in [2]. We'll have to include it in the
libmspack copy embedded in clamav, which is used in wheezy.

Best regards,
Andreas

Oh great. So for clamav we have to fix it stable since sid uses the
external library (jay!).
This "type fix" does not look that bad. Do we wait for the upstream
maintainer on this atm?

Is the security team aware of the various in-tree copy of this library?

I can upload this simple fix quickly, nevertheless i did not have time
to proofread it. Any comment?

Joss filled #675560 tagged security.

I tested the cabextract build using the library but had no reply. I
wanted to have at least one real user for the lib before pinging the
other related packages. I should probably have been more aggressive on
this front, my bad.

It would be nice if we could keep this in sync. I will look at this in
tonight at the latest and give more feedback.

Yes. Atleast clamav can be triggered via remote. Not sure about the
others.

I plan to add the following patch to clamav. I added a small comment
why we have the busy loop there. So far it looks like a good idea. The
only problem is that we need off_t beeing 64bit (LFS) or it won't work
on 32bit. No problem on Debian side…

I added upstream on CC hoping that they will take this or do something
about it :)

If nobody objects, I push this tomorrow into the clamav repo.

Subject: [PATCH] make frame_end off_t

Debian bts #773041, #772891 contains a report of a .cab file which
causes an endless loop.
Eric Sharkey diagnosed the problem as frame_end is 32bit and overflows
and the result the loop makes no progress. He also added that making
it off_t (and so 64bit with LFS) fixes the problem.

The problem seems that after the overflow, window_posn is larger than
frame_end and therefore we never enter the loop to make progress. But we
still have out_bytes >0 so we don't leave the outer loop either.

This patch is based on Eric Sharkey comments.

I think there is a better way than changing the type of frame_end to off_t.
It is possible to avoid the overflow by reordering the code:

--- libmspack-0.4.orig/mspack/qtmd.c
+++ libmspack-0.4/mspack/qtmd.c
@@ -296,10 +296,12 @@ int qtmd_decompress(struct qtmd_stream *

     /* decode more, up to the number of bytes needed, the frame boundary,
      * or the window boundary, whichever comes first */
-    frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));
-    if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < frame_end) {
+    if (frame_todo < (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr))) {
       frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
     }
+    else {
+      frame_end = window_posn + (out_bytes - (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr));
+    }
     if (frame_end > qtm->window_size) {
       frame_end = qtm->window_size;
     }

This works, because frame_todo is at most QTM_FRAME_SIZE = 32768.

Merry Christmas,

Even better, I like it. The patch at the end of the email is what I
pushed into the wheezy branch for clamav [0]. So after an upload for
stable, we have Wheezy fixed. I have no idea how to close this bug for
unstable since it has to be fixed in a different package. Probably
manually with a comment…
Side question: In case someone has unattended-upgrades running, how does
he get clamd restarted after a libmspack update?

Subject: libmspack: qtmd: fix frame_end overflow

Debian bts #773041, #772891 contains a report of a .cab file which
causes an endless loop.
Eric Sharkey diagnosed the problem as frame_end is 32bit and overflows
and the result the loop makes no progress.
The problem seems that after the overflow, window_posn is larger than
frame_end and therefore we never enter the loop to make progress. But we
still have out_bytes >0 so we don't leave the outer loop either.

Andreas Cadhalpun suggested to instead makeing frame_end 64bit, we could
avoid the overflow by reordering the code the following way:

original, with just out_bytes (without (qtm->o_end - qtm->o_ptr))
| frame_end = window_posn + out_bytes;
| if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < frame_end) {
|         frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
| }

replace frame_end in "if" with its content (and move the first frame_end
into the else path)
| if ((window_posn + frame_todo) < (window_posn + out_bytes))
|         frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
| else
|         frame_end = window_posn + out_bytes;

remove window_posn from "if" since it is the same both times.
| if (frame_todo <  out_bytes)
|         frame_end = window_posn + frame_todo;
| else
|         frame_end = window_posn + out_bytes;

Andreas added:
|This works, because frame_todo is at most QTM_FRAME_SIZE = 32768.

Yes, thanks.

I'm marking the unstable version as not affected, because we have #773041
to track the progress for libmspack. So the upload of the fixed wheezy
version will close this bug.

I think needrestart can do that.

Best regards,
Andreas
