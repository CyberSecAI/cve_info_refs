Debian Security Advisory DSA-3273-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : tiff
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8127 CVE-2014-8128 CVE-2014-8129 CVE-2014-9330
                 CVE-2014-9655

William Robinet and Michal Zalewski discovered multiple vulnerabilities
in the TIFF library and its tools, which may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed TIFF file
is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.2-6+deb7u4.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
before the initial release.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-26 10:42:03 UTC  ``` Multiple out-of-bounds reads were reported in various libtiff tools:  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2500> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2497> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2496> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2485> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2486> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2484>  Above upstream bugs were fixed by the below commits:  2014-12-21  Even Rouault  <even.rouault> * tools/pal2rgb.c, tools/thumbnail.c: fix crash by disabling TIFFTAG_INKNAMES copying. The right fix would be to properly copy it, but not worth the burden for those esoteric utilities. <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2484> ([CVE-2014-8127](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8127))  2014-12-21  Even Rouault  <even.rouault> * tools/tiff2bw.c: when Photometric=RGB, the utility only works if SamplesPerPixel = 3. Enforce that <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2485> ([CVE-2014-8127](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8127))  2014-12-21  Even Rouault  <even.rouault> Fix various crasher bugs on fuzzed images. * libtiff/tif_dir.c: TIFFSetField(): refuse to set negative values for TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION and TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION that cause asserts when writing the directory * libtiff/tif_dirread.c: TIFFReadDirectory(): refuse to read ColorMap or TransferFunction if BitsPerSample has not yet been read, otherwise reading it later will cause user code to crash if BitsPerSample > 1  * libtiff/tif_getimage.c: TIFFRGBAImageOK(): return FALSE if LOGLUV with SamplesPerPixel != 3, or if CIELAB with SamplesPerPixel != 3 or BitsPerSample != 8 * libtiff/tif_next.c: in the "run mode", use tilewidth for tiled images instead of imagewidth to avoid crash * tools/bmp2tiff.c: fix crash due to int overflow related to input BMP dimensions * tools/tiff2pdf.c: fix crash due to invalid tile count (should likely be checked by libtiff too). Detect invalid settings of BitsPerSample/SamplesPerPixel for CIELAB / ITULAB * tools/tiffcrop.c: fix crash due to invalid TileWidth/TileHeight * tools/tiffdump.c: fix crash due to overflow of entry count.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-03-24 09:36:09 UTC  ``` Patch =====  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=778923>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c2)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-06-01 11:56:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw in libtiff.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-02 16:40:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1547 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1547.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-02 16:59:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1546 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1546.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1185805#c11)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-05-11 10:47:46 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1326257](show_bug.cgi?id=1326257 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2016-3658 libtiff: out-of-bounds read in the TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array function") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

It is an out-of-bounds memory read which occurs in tif_packbits.c  84            b = *bp++, cc--, n = 1;  This is caused by the value of length variable which is set in bmp2tiff:405. The function TIFFWriteScanline continues to read values after the end of the BMP file until it reaches out of bounds memory.  I attach both gdb and valgrind output.  The issue was found using 4.0.3 source code. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2494#c1) From Paris Zoumpouloglou  2014-12-09 08:02:36* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=578)](attachment.cgi?id=578 "bmp crash file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=578&action=edit "bmp crash file") bmp crash file ```  ------- *Comment [#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2494#c2) From Paris Zoumpouloglou  2014-12-09 08:03:19* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=579)](attachment.cgi?id=579 "gdb output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=579&action=edit "gdb output") gdb output ```  ------- *Comment [#3](show_bug.cgi?id=2494#c3) From Paris Zoumpouloglou  2014-12-09 08:04:11* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=580)](attachment.cgi?id=580 "valgrind output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=580&action=edit "valgrind output") valgrind output ```  ------- *Comment [#4](show_bug.cgi?id=2494#c4) From Even Rouault  2014-12-21 12:16:23* ------- ``` Fixed by  2014-12-21  Even Rouault  <even.rouault@spatialys.com>      Fix various crasher bugs on fuzzed images.     * libtiff/tif_dir.c: TIFFSetField(): refuse to set negative values for     TIFFTAG_XRESOLUTION and TIFFTAG_YRESOLUTION that cause asserts when writing     the directory     * libtiff/tif_dirread.c: TIFFReadDirectory(): refuse to read ColorMap or     TransferFunction if BitsPerSample has not yet been read, otherwise reading     it later will cause user code to crash if BitsPerSample > 1     * libtiff/tif_getimage.c: TIFFRGBAImageOK(): return FALSE if LOGLUV with     SamplesPerPixel != 3, or if CIELAB with SamplesPerPixel != 3 or BitsPerSample != 8     * libtiff/tif_next.c: in the "run mode", use tilewidth for tiled images     instead of imagewidth to avoid crash     * tools/bmp2tiff.c: fix crash due to int overflow related to input BMP dimensions     * tools/tiff2pdf.c: fix crash due to invalid tile count (should likely be checked by     libtiff too).

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libTIFF, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.7** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifier and bug reports referenced for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
image file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.7"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-31 06:19:04 UTC  ``` An Out-of-bounds read flaw followed by a crash was found in the bmp2tiff utility (A utility used to create a TIFF file from a Microsoft Windows Device Independent Bitmap image file) shipped with libtiff. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted BMP (Bitmap Image) file that, when processed by bmp2tiff, would cause bmp2tiff to crash.  Upstream bug: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2494>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-03-23 07:02:00 UTC  ``` Patch =====  <https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2014/12/msg01782.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c2)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-03-23 10:55:11 UTC  ``` Analysis ========  According to the file format specification of BMP   * +---------------------+  * | BMPFileHeader       |  * +---------------------+  * | BMPInfoHeader       |  * +---------------------+  * | BMPColorEntry array |  * +---------------------+  * | Colour-index array  |  * +---------------------+  in the following code of bmp2tiff.c  struct { ...     int32       iWidth;         /* Image width */     int32       iHeight;        /* Image height. If positive, image has bottom                                  * left origin, if negative --- top left. */ ... } BMPInfoHeader;  ...                 if (bmp_type == BMPT_WIN4                     || bmp_type == BMPT_WIN5                     || bmp_type == BMPT_OS22) {                         read(fd, &info_hdr.iWidth, 4); ... #ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN                         TIFFSwabLong((uint32*) &info_hdr.iWidth);  While reading the iWidth from BMPInfoHeader of malicious file, it does not check for the negative value of the iWidth in the following code. According to the file format specification of bmp iWidth should not be having negative value in it.                  width = info_hdr.iWidth;  Failing to sanitize the iWidth value initially and passing it to variable 'width' which is later used to encode or decode packedbits causes Out-of-bounds read flaw which leads to crash. In the libtiff only bmp2tiff seems to be having this flaw, so crash would occur only if bmp2tiff is being used by any application opening malicious file. Impact of this flaw is low and it is bit complex to create such file.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c3)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-06-01 11:56:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw in libtiff.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-02 16:40:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2016:1547 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1547.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1177893#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-08-02 16:59:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:1546 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1546.html>   ``` |  |

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2014-9655, CVE-2015-1547, CVE-2015-8784, CVE-2015-8683, CVE-2015-8665, CVE-2015-8781, CVE-2015-8782, CVE-2015-8783, CVE-2016-3990, CVE-2016-5320)
* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, tiff2rgba). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool. (CVE-2014-8127, CVE-2014-8129, CVE-2014-8130, CVE-2014-9330, CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2015-8668, CVE-2016-3632, CVE-2016-3945, CVE-2016-3991)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:
