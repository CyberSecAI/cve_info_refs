  "CVE-2014-9330": {
    "description": "The provided information details an integer overflow vulnerability in the `bmp2tiff` utility of the libtiff library. This vulnerability leads to out-of-bounds reads and a crash when processing crafted BMP image files. It is triggered by a lack of sanitization for the `iWidth` field in the BMP header, allowing it to be negative, which leads to further issues in memory access.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the bmp2tiff utility related to input BMP image dimensions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation allowing negative values for image dimensions",
        "Out-of-bounds memory read due to unchecked integer overflow"
       ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing a crafted BMP file using the bmp2tiff utility"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
         "Ability to provide a malicious BMP file to the vulnerable program."
