**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper size consistency checks within the `udf_read_inode` function (`fs/udf/inode.c`) of the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem implementation. The code doesn't sufficiently validate the size of certain data structures, causing a buffer over-read.
*  The content from `www.suse.com_9031fef7_20250126_042057.html` provides additional detail, specifying the vulnerability occurs when loading an inode and that the size of the inode with data stored in ICB is not properly verified. The size should match the allocation descriptor length and it must fit in the ICB.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient bounds checking in the `udf_read_inode` function, specifically when handling data-structures within a UDF filesystem image.
    *   The code relies on component lengths without proper validation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to trigger a system crash, by supplying a crafted UDF filesystem image, therefore causing a denial of service.
    *  The CVSS v2 score indicates a complete availability impact.
    *  The content from `www.suse.com_9031fef7_20250126_042057.html` also indicates that it is caused by reading from crafted UDF filesystem images, allowing local users to trigger a system crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users who can mount a UDF filesystem.
    *   **Crafted File System Image:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted UDF filesystem image to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker must be a local user on a system with the affected kernel.
    *   The user needs the capability to mount a UDF filesystem.
    *   The attacker must be able to create or obtain a malicious UDF filesystem image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in the Linux kernel version 3.18.2.
*   SUSE classifies this vulnerability as having "low" severity, while NVD scores it with a "medium" base score.
*   The SUSE security team indicates they won't fix all kernel CVEs, thus certain bug classes may be declared as "won't fix".
* The openSUSE-SU-2015:1382-1 from `lists.opensuse.org_9f4e1d2e_20250124_231054.html` addresses this issue for openSUSE 13.2, and includes a list of affected packages.
*   The commit message from `www.kernel.org_be5bcf4b_20250124_231059.html` and the patch from `github.com_94f8bb65_20250124_231104.html` shows that the patch specifically checks that the inode size matches the allocation descriptor length when loading an inode with data stored in an ICB (In-Control Block). The patch also verifies if the inode size is greater than the blocksize. This confirms the root cause described above, which involves size consistency checks when loading the inode with data stored in ICB.

In summary, CVE-2014-9729 involves a local DoS vulnerability within the UDF filesystem implementation of the Linux kernel. By providing a crafted UDF filesystem image, a local user can cause a system crash due to missing size validation in the `udf_read_inode` function and symlink handling.
