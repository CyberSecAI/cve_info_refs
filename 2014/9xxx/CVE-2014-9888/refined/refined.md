      "root_cause": "Incorrect DMA mapping permissions in the ARM kernel driver.",
      "weaknesses": "DMA mapping permissions were incorrectly being derived from `pgprot_kernel` instead of `PAGE_KERNEL`. This resulted in DMA mappings being marked with executable permissions, which is not intended.",
      "impact": "A local attacker could potentially exploit this by gaining unexpected code execution capabilities via DMA mappings. This could lead to privilege escalation and potentially a local permanent device compromise.",
      "attack_vector": "Local malicious application",
       "required_capabilities": "A local malicious application or process capable of interacting with the DMA mapping functionality of the kernel. This usually means a compromised or rogue application with some level of privilege."
