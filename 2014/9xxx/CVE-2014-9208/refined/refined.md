Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in multiple buffer overflow issues within the Advantech WebAccess ActiveX control (specifically `AspVCObj.dll`). The `ConvToSafeArray` API is specifically highlighted, but other functions like `UpdateProject`, `InterfaceFilter`, `FileProcess`, `GetWideStrCpy`, `GetRecipeInfo`, and `GetLastTagNbr` are also vulnerable to buffer overflows when provided with overly long strings. These functions appear to lack proper input validation, allowing attackers to write beyond allocated buffer boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Multiple functions within the `AspVCObj.dll` ActiveX control are susceptible to buffer overflows. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerable functions do not properly validate the size of the input strings, allowing attackers to provide overly long strings that cause the overflow.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides within an ActiveX control, making it exploitable through web browsers if the control is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This would grant the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Although the exploit type is classified as 'dos', the nature of the vulnerability could also lead to a denial of service by crashing the application if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious web pages that embed the vulnerable ActiveX control. When a victim visits such a page with a vulnerable version of the software installed, the exploit can be triggered.
*   **Malicious Documents/Applications:** ActiveX controls can also be embedded in malicious documents or applications, leading to exploitation when these files are opened.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Content:** Attackers need the ability to create malicious web pages, documents or applications that utilize the vulnerable ActiveX control to pass overly long strings to the vulnerable methods.
*   **Target User Must Access Malicious Content:** The target user must either browse to a malicious website or open a malicious document or application containing the crafted exploit.
*  **Vulnerable Software Installed:** The target system needs to have the vulnerable versions of Advantech WebAccess and its ActiveX control installed.
