    "Description": "The woff_open_font function in sfnt/sfobjs.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with offset+length calculations without restricting length values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Web Open Font Format (WOFF) file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in offset+length calculations within the `woff_open_font` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impact.",
    "Attack vector": "Crafted Web Open Font Format (WOFF) file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide the crafted WOFF file to an application utilizing the vulnerable FreeType library, likely via a network or local file access."
