Well, let's see... |

I know I had some positive feedback from atrol when considering moving towards a "MantisContext" class to track this sort of stuff.  We probably need to decide on if we are going to move to that approach, before fixing this - otherwise it's a case of adding user\_id, project\_id all the way through the chains |

|  | |
| [atrol](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=11111)   [atrol](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=11111)  2014-06-02 16:42  developer    [~0040723](view.php?id=9885#c40723 "Direct link to note") | IIRC "MantisContext" class was some kind of more elegant method to set/save/restore/get values of a collection of global variables. But it would be still quite easy to use it the wrong way. There is no big difference between calling a SetContext method and setting $g\_project\_override.  I prefer in a first step to have user\_id and project\_id at least for the low level functions as non optional parameters. Thus it's clear for a developer that he has to think about project and user when using such a function.  Introducing a new concept (which might break plugins) is probably nothing that should be done in 1.3. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
