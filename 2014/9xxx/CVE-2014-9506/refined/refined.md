      "details": "MantisBT issue #9885 describes an information disclosure vulnerability. When a user is monitoring issue A, and issue A is related to issue B, the user receives an email notification about the relation. This notification includes the summary of issue B, even if the user does not have permission to view issue B. Furthermore, any email notification lists *all* relationships, even those the user should not see. This allows an attacker to get information about issues that they should not have access to. The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.18."
