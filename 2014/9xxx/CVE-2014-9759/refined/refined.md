Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9759:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stemmed from an incomplete blacklist of configuration options in MantisBT's SOAP API. Specifically, the `config_is_private()` function was used to prevent access to sensitive configuration options via the SOAP API. However, this blacklist was not properly maintained. When a new configuration option (`crypto_master_salt`) was added, it was misspelled in the blacklist (`master_crypto_salt`), which resulted in the sensitive config option being accessible via the SOAP API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Blacklist Approach:** The use of a blacklist to manage sensitive configuration options proved to be error-prone. The maintainers failed to keep the blacklist updated, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Configuration Exposure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of the `crypto_master_salt` configuration option through the SOAP API due to a typo in the blacklist.
*   **Potential for Further Exposure:** The underlying issue was not specific to just one configuration option; any new config or renaming of an existing one, without correctly updating the blacklist could lead to information disclosure.
*   **SOAP API Access:** The vulnerability relied on the availability of the SOAP API in MantisBT.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Data:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the `crypto_master_salt`, which is a critical security parameter.
*   **Compromise of Security:** The exposed salt could be used to compromise the security of the system and potentially decrypt sensitive data or forge authentications if that was the purpose of the salt.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SOAP API:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending SOAP requests to the MantisBT API.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The SOAP API requires a valid user account with at least `webservice_readonly_access_level_threshold` (VIEWER by default) or anonymous access enabled with the same effective permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid MantisBT User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with access to the SOAP API or anonymous access enabled.
*   **Knowledge of SOAP API:** The attacker needs to know how to interact with the MantisBT SOAP API to extract config values.
*   **Network Access:** Network access to the MantisBT instance is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved switching from a blacklist to a whitelist approach, explicitly defining which configuration options can be accessed via SOAP API.
*   The issue was discovered by Paul Richards, with the fix implemented by Roland Becker.
*   The vulnerable version is >= 1.3.0-beta.1 and was fixed in 1.3.0-rc.2.
*   The MantisBT team recommends that all installations with SOAP API enabled should be patched and that a new salt is generated immediately.
*   The CVE assignment notes that requesting a CVE ID for a beta version is unusual but not restricted.
*   The MantisBT team also had discussions about the possibility of exposing other global variables, and discussed future improvements to configuration management.
