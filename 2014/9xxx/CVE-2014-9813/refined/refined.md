Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9813:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference in wpg file handling within ImageMagick. This occurs when processing a corrupted viff file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the ImageMagick application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or corrupted viff file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted or corrupted viff file to the ImageMagick application. No specific privileges or network access is needed, just ability to get the image processed.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves handling a corrupted viff file, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
- The vulnerability is part of a larger batch of security bugs found through fuzzing of ImageMagick.
- Red Hat has marked this issue as "WONTFIX", which means that they will not address this vulnerability, likely due to it being in an older version of the software.
- Upstream patches have been made to resolve this issue.
