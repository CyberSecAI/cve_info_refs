Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-9449

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the `RiffVideo::infoTagsHandler` function within the `riffvideo.cpp` file of the Exiv2 library. This occurs when processing specifically crafted AVI files, particularly within the IKEY INFO tag. The size of the data to be read from the IKEY tag can be larger than the allocated buffer leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `RiffVideo::infoTagsHandler` function when processing IKEY tags. The code did not correctly handle cases where the size of the data in the tag is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted AVI file. The overflow can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and program termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted AVI file with a maliciously sized IKEY INFO tag.
- An attacker can target users or automated systems that process video files using Exiv2.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious AVI file to a user or system that processes it with the vulnerable version of Exiv2. No special privileges are required on the target system.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The issue was specifically identified with a video file that contained a large amount of data (8192 bytes) in the IKEY tag, while the buffer allocated for reading this tag was significantly smaller (100 bytes).
- The `exvGettext()` function, which is used for localization, was initially suspected but later ruled out as the main cause of the crash. However, it was noted that `exvGettext()` might not be thread-safe.
- The fix involved a buffer overflow fix in the INFO tags of `RIFFVIDEO.CPP`.
- The issue was resolved in Exiv2 version 0.24-r1 (Gentoo) and 0.24-2ubuntu1.1 (Ubuntu).
