{
  "CVE-2014-9854": {
    "description": "coders/tiff.c in ImageMagick allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors related to the \"identification of image.\"",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the TIFF image identification code within ImageMagick's coders/tiff.c. The code attempts to fill memory during the image identification process, without proper bounds checking or resource management.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.",
      "Application crash."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted TIFF image to ImageMagick which would cause the application to crash due to excessive memory usage during the identification phase.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. They only require the ability to provide a specially crafted TIFF image to ImageMagick.",
