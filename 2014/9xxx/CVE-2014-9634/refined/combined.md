### [2.307](//2.307/)

August 17, 2021

The default Docker images for Jenkins 2.307 ('2.307', 'latest', 'alpine', 'slim', ...) use Java 11 unless specifically tagged with the `jdk8` string. See the [Docker images use Java 11 by default](/blog/2021/08/17/docker-images-use-jdk-11-by-default/) blog post for more details.

Major enhancement

* Replace the term "master" with "controller" (for the main Jenkins application) or "built-in node" in user interface strings and documentation as appropriate.
  [pull 5425](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5425)
* Add migration code to change the node name (e.g. `NODE_NAME` environment variable) and label of the built-in node only after explicit migration by an administrator.
  New installations get the new node and label immediately.
  If a job definition, Pipeline definition, or tool installer reference must be tied to the built-in node, it should use the label "`built-in`".
  [Built-In Node Name and Label Migration](/doc/book/managing/built-in-node-migration/)
* Add the system property `jenkins.model.Jenkins.nodeNameAndSelfLabelOverride` to specify a different node name and label for the built-in node (e.g. for Configuration as Code use cases) than the one otherwise determined.
  This will not affect other uses of the node name, such as the URL to the built-in node (now `/computer/(built-in)/`).

* Developer: Jenkins now uses an updated version of the `AntClassLoader` class with fewer custom patches.
  [pull 5656](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5656)
* Removed: The Woodstox implementation of the StAX API has been removed from Jenkins core.
  Users of the Azure Artifact Manager, Azure Container Agents, Azure Storage, and Azure SDK API plugins must upgrade those plugins to the latest versions in lockstep with this core upgrade.
  Plugins that consume Woodstox should depend on it directly or via the Jackson 2 API plugin.

  [JENKINS-61197](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-61197)

### [2.222](//2.222/)

February 23, 2020

Major enhancement

* Revamp the layout and icons of the header bar and breadcrumbs.
  Instances with plugins that depend on details of the Jenkins layout (e.g. Simple Theme Plugin) may experience UI/layout problems.
  A new experimental header color scheme can be enabled by setting the `jenkins.ui.refresh` system property to `true`.
  [JENKINS-60920](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60920)
* Introduce a new experimental UI that can be enabled by setting the `jenkins.ui.refresh` system property to `true`.
  Currently it includes a new header color scheme, more changes to be added as a part of the UI/UX revamp.
  [pull 4463](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4463), [JENKINS-60920](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60920), [JEP-223](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/223/README.adoc), [Jenkins UX SIG](/sigs/ux/)
* Add a new experimental `Overall/Manage` permission which allows a user to configure parts of the global Jenkins configuration without having the `Overall/Administer` permission.
  This is an experimental feature, disabled by default, that can be enabled by setting the `jenkins.security.ManagePermission` system property to `true`.
  [pull 4501](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4501), [JENKINS-60266](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60266), [JEP-223](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/223/README.adoc)
* Add a new experimental `Overall/SystemRead` permission, which gives (almost) full read access to the Jenkins instance.
  The permission is disabled by default, install the Extended Read Permission plugin to activate it.
  [pull 4506](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4506), [JENKINS-12548](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-12548), [JEP-224](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/224/README.adoc), [Extended Read Permission plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/extended-read-permission/)

Enhancement

* Deprecate the `Overall/RunScripts`, `Overall/UploadPlugins`, and `Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter` permissions.
  Permissions were announced as dangerous and disabled by default in major authorization plugins in 2017.
  Custom authorization strategy implementations that grant `Overall/Administer` without implying one or more of these three permissions will no longer work as expected.
  Configurations that grant any of these permissions to users without `Overall/Administer` will no longer work as expected.

* Remove the ability to have CSRF protection disabled.
  Instances upgrading from older versions of Jenkins will have CSRF protection enabled and the default issuer set if they currently have it disabled.

  [JENKINS-61121](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-61121)

### [2.221](//2.221/)

February 19, 2020

Globally configured build discarders are available for the first time with this release. Jenkins will now execute the configured per-project build discarder periodically **even if no build is currently finishing**. Globally configured build discarders may delete old builds if a project has been configured with a more aggressive build discarder configuration since the last build was run.

Major enhancement

* Add globally configured build discarders that delete old builds not marked as "keep forever" even if there is no, or a less aggressive, per-project build discarder configured, executed periodically and after a build finishes.

* If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration will now be treated as final with respect to the behavior of *Job/Build* checks from **Build other projects** and **Build after other projects are built**.

To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a **Project default Build Authorization** to be **Run as anonymous**. Note that this will affect all build-scoped permission checks, including for example *Agent/Build*.

### What's new in 1.71 (01-07-2007)

* Modified to create a shell script file in the system-specific temporary directory
  on each node, instead of the workspace.
  ([issue 183](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-183))* Fixed a serious bug where saving the job configuration is done **before**
    reflecting the submitted configuration, instead of after. This could very likely
    cause a data loss issue when Hudson is restarted. If you are using 1.69/1.70,
    you can work around this problem by making changes, submitting it, then reopen
    the config page and submit that one more time.

### What's new in 1.70 (01-06-2007)

* Added a new listener SCMListener so that plugins can do something
  when change set is determined for a build. This is useful for integration with other systems.* Added an extension point ChangeLogAnnotator so that plugins can do HTML markup
    on changelog text. Again, this is useful for integration with other systems,
    like hyperlinking to issue tracker.* Fixed a packaging problem of slave.jar. It was missing dependency jars.

### What's new in 1.69 (01-03-2007)

* Modified not to show the complete build records in case you have a large history.
  ([issue 212](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-212))* Progress bars now show the tool tip to indicate the ETA of builds.
    ([issue 210](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-210))* Fixed NPE in isAutoRefresh

        If you've been using distributed builds,
        please see [documentation](https://hudson.dev.java.net/masterSlave.html)
        and [this e-mail](https://www.nabble.com/New-remoting-code-merged-to-the-trunk-tf2895706.html) for more details.* Improved hyperlinks in test reports.
          ([issue 216](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-216))* Build time trend chart is now clickable.* Test result trend chart is now clickable.* Modified the internals so that plugins can contribute graphs and other HTML fragments,
                like test report trend.* Fixed a bug where a change in the node affinity setting of a project
                  doesn't cause the rescheduling of builds if builds are already in queue.* **Be sure to also update your plugins if you are using any.**

### What's new in 1.68 (12-20-2006)

* Fixed a bug where help links in a form set dynamically added don't work.

* The build history panel now shows build descriptions, if any
  ([issue 148](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-148))* System configuration can be now saved even if some agents are down.* Fixed a race condition which could cause changes made to large CVS projects to not be reported
      in the build changelog. Now all CVS checkouts and updates use timestamps.

              ([issue 199](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-199))* Build time graph now uses different colors to reflect the build status.
                ([issue 200](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-200))* Don't display "create view" link if the security is enabled and the user is not logged in.
                  ([issue 201](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-201))* Fixed a problem so that form pages are not auto-refreshed regardless of the current user setting.

      when Hudson security is enabled
      ([issue 177](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-177))* Added an easy and secure way to trigger builds remotely from scripts when Hudson
        security is enabled
        ([issue 178](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-178)).* Added brief changelog information (author, message) to top of build failure mails.* [XVNC] Display numbers now start at 10 to avoid clashes with normal displays.* [XVNC] Fixed allocation of display numbers to recycle old numbers.* [XVNC] Fixed stopping of vncserver process.

                  on the status page which jumps directly to the raw console text. Using this link
                  can save your browser from freezing up trying to view an enormous log file. You
                  may also wish to download the log file from this URL and browse offline in a text
                  viewer designed for large files.* Persist auto refresh mode for session in a cookie.

        for jobs that need GUIs.
        ([issue 158](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-158))* Added one more extension point in the architecture to support new plugins.* If a project using both CVS "legacy mode" (multiple top-level modules) and update mode checks out
            additional modules as part of its build, changes in these extra modules will be reported in
            the changelog for subsequent builds.

### What's new in 1.63 (11-18-2006)

  ([issue 65](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-65))* I think I fixed a bug where a job can accidentally run hung even though no executor
    seems to be building it.
    ([issue 62](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-62))

### What's new in 1.33

* Fixed bugs wrt handling non-ASCII characters in project names, test names, etc.
  (The servlet spec is a real mess when it comes to i18n!)* Added a new view to display console output as text/plain
    (for downloading and maximum screen use)* The last successful build log is kept regardless of the log rotation setting,
      so that at least one successful build is always available for download.
      ([issue 57](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-57))

### What's new in 1.32

* Added spinner image when console output is being loaded progressively.* Added auto-completion to the project relationship comparison page.* Added links from a project index page to "downstream" project pages
      (those are the projects that will be built once the current project is built)* Fixed a critical bug where the rendering of the external job page fails.* If JUnit test report tallying is configured but no test is found,
          Hudson assumes that it's a configuration error and marks a build as a failure.

### What's new in 1.31

* Modified to gracefully handle unsafe characters in the JUnit test reports.
  ([issue 42](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-42))* Hudson can now render Subversion change log details correctly.* Fixed a typo
      ([issue 48](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-48))* Fixed various issues in running Hudson in Jetty.* Changed the format of $HUDSON\_HOME/config.xml slightly to make it look nicer
          (this is a backward compatible change.)* Fixed various issues in running Hudson in JDK 1.4* Subversion-based projects now display the repository revision number
              ([issue 50](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-50))

### What's new in 1.30

* Projects can be now configured to temporarily disable new builds
  ([issue 39](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-39))* Build history now shows a new pending build.
    ([issue 44](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-44))* Console output of an on-going build now updates automatically without reloading
      ([issue 46](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-44))* Implemented a new page where you can track which builds of one project is used
        by which builds of another project.

### What's new in 1.29

* Test result trend can be displayed in two modes now. One is just to show failures,
  the other is to show both total tests and failures. The former is useful when
  you have healthy tests (a large number of tests and small number of failures.)* Fixed the bug where RSS pages weren't rendered correctly at all.

### What's new in 1.28

* Projects with junit report configured will now produce a trend report* Improved the efficiency when loading a project page with a large test result* Next build number of jobs are now stored in a separate file
      so that configurations can be stored in CVS more easily* Changed the URL assigned to fingerprint pages, so that they can be
        bookmarked (for example, you can keep a bookmark of "fingerprint of foo.jar in the last successful build")* Implemented cron-like scheduled execution.* Updated help documents a bit.

### What's new in 1.27

* If no test result is found when a test report is configured, a build is considered a failure.* A bug fix is made where sometimes the e-mail notification reports incorrect results
    (this time, it's really fixed!)

### What's new in 1.26

* The URL in the e-mail was incorrect. Fixed that.* When a new job is created by copying another, the build number wasn't reset to 1.* A bug fix is made where sometimes the e-mail notification reports incorrect results.

### What's new in 1.25

* Improved the performance of rendering the build page with a large test result.* Fixed a problem where a large test result consumes the PermGen space too much.* Implemented the 'fingerprint' recording. See [a separate document](https://hudson.dev.java.net/fingerprint.html) for more details.* Fixed a problem where "tag this build" pages don't show the left task bar.* Agent can be now marked as "temporarily offline" to avoid builds to be scheduled on it* Implemented a new switch on the e-mail notification to avoid sending out
            e-mails on every unstable build. Useful for those lazy projects where test failures are the norm.

### What's new in 1.24

* Tweaked the way Hudson launches a remote job, so that it can work with older versions of Unix.
  (Some Solaris systems seem to be unable to handle "~/bin/slave" while others do.)* Placed the icon to cancel builds on more places ([issue 36](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-36))* The top page and view pages can now display user-configured HTML.
      Useful for linking to relevant resources or post a notice.* Changed the URL assignment so that build #53 of project ABC is now ".../hudson/job/ABC/53".
        The next build number is no longer modifiable through the configuration screen.
        This change should make the URL more intuitive and short. Old URLs are still supported
        for the backward compatibility.* Implemented a workaround for [a Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89419)
          that sometimes displays build status icons incorrectly (when you reload a build page to check the updated status.)* Fixed a bug where URLs in the notification e-mail is not escaped.

### What's new in 1.23

* Fixed a bug where e-mail notifications weren't working.

### What's new in 1.22

* Fixed a JBoss deployment problem reported by Wilson Jimmy.* Introduced the "unstable" state to represent test failures.* More help documents.* build notice e-mail now includes a link to the website.* Started adding page for each agent ([issue 35](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-35))* Agents can now be configured so that they can be reserved
            for certain jobs.* Fixed URL assignment to test failures, so that an URL to a test result
              of the last successful build can point to the same test across builds.* Test results in a class view is now sortable (just like all the other tables.)

### What's new in 1.21

* RSS links are added to HTML header so that RSS-aware browsers can pick them up* Added a new operation mode for CVS to prevent redundant intermediate directories.
    Added a compatibility option so that existing projects won't be affected.

### What's new in 1.20

* Various bug fixes for regressions occurred in 1.19* Expanded the documentation.* If there are a lot of the archived artifacts, Hudson now switches to the tree view.* Modified not to display "build" link to non-buildable jobs.

### What's new in 1.19

* Various bug fixes and improvements in the test report.* Next/Previous build link now cycles through the same page between builds.
    So if you are reading the console output page, just clicking "previous build" will
    take you to the console output of the previous build.* Implemented controller/agent support* When a large number of build artifacts are archived,
        Hudson won't show a very long list of bullet lists.* Changed the icon that kills an on-going build to 'x' icon.* Updated the ATOM feed icon to the one from https://feedicon.com/* Fixed the location and color of login/logout link.

### What's new in 1.18

* Hudson now has JUnit test result report* Subversion configuration now allows more options to be set.* Supported configuration of the "quiet period"* Some /bin/sh doesn't like "-x -e". So changed it to "-xe"

### What's new in 1.17

* Changed the version scheme. Instead of 1.0.X, I'm now calling them 1.X.* Clicking progress bars will take you to the console output page.* Fixed a bug where an incorrect error handling causes 500 if you failed to properly create a project in a view.* Fixed security holes.* Improved the workspace file view* Hudson now returns the "Last-Modified" header correctly so that clients can cache HTML smartly
            (this was really a bug in [stapler](https://stapler.dev.java.net/)* Replaced PNG images by GIF images to avoid Internet Explorer & PNG transparency issue

### What's new in 1.0.16

* Fixed a critical presentation issue in 1.0.15

### What's new in 1.0.15

* UI make over

### What's new in 1.0.14

* A new job can be now created by copying an existing one.* Javadoc publisher can show the link to the project javaflow from the navigation bar.* When entering CVSROOT, it auto-completes.* Jobs can be now grouped into views.* Workspace view now sorts files in alphabetical order.* Added a new build publishing step that publishes javadoc to the project page.* Patched Ant so that CVS changelog computation won't hang even when
              commit messages confuses the changelog parser.

### What's new in 1.0.13

* Maven support.* When terminating a build, kill all the processes spawned.* Fixed rendering errors that appear in IE.* Fixed a bug in subversion support.

### What's new in 1.0.12

* Builds in a queue can be now cancelled (issue 24)* Hudson can now monitor external jobs that are run on remote machines.* Bug fixes.

### What's new in 1.0.11

* Reduced the disk space usage for CVS-based projects* Projects can now declare the JDK version it wants to use more easily.
    (Previously you needed to use the shell option.)* Improved UI experience in Ant/JDK installation configurations by using JavaScript.* Fixed the incorrect title of the RSS feeds ([issue 23](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-23))* Bug fixes

### What's new in 1.0.10

* CVS-based projects now allow builds to be tagged long after they are completed.
  (For example, if you realize 1 week later that build #95 is important, you can tag it.)* Fixed bugs in the RSS feeds (thanks to Ronald Klop)* Hudson now generates HTML files that prevents robots from accessing links

```

I assume this will also happen with other versions of Tomcat >= 7.0.41 (See <https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54974>).

Should Jenkins check the state of the context before attempting to set the HttpOnly property?

Subject: jenkins-tomcat: Secure and HttpOnly flags are not set for cookies with Jenkins on Tomcat
Package: jenkins-tomcat
Version: 1.565.3-2.1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Dear Maintainer,

The Jenkins currently shipped with Debian doesn't correctly set the HttpOnly and
Secure options on session cookies.

The first option prohibits the cookies to be read by scripts, thus preventing
XSS scripts vulnerabilities from stealing sessions.
The second option prohibits the session cookie to be sent over clear HTTP connection,
thus preventing malvolent users to steal session cookie while redirecting users to
HTTP access.

There is already an upstream bug for this problem located at this url:
<https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-25019>
with a proposed fix that only adresses the HttpOnly issue for Tomcat.

The problem is reported in Tomcat log with the following lines:

Why isn't the missing “secure” flag a Tomcat configuration issue?

Hi Florian,

Yes it could be seen that way, as we discussed with Emmanuel during the
Paris BSP today, but in fact it's even better, I checked and there is no
problem with Tomcat as  the Secure flag as it already automatically set
with the default configuration:

  - if Tomcat is accessed through the HTTPS connector, all cookies are
secure thanks to the connector Secure option which is set by default,
  - if Tomcat is accessed through the AJP13 connector, Apache (or other
webserver) transfers through the AJP protocol the information wether the
connexion was through SSL or not, Tomcat uses it to set the Secure flag
accordingly.

So the upstream patch perfectly solves the issue and I was able to apply it
successfully on the current package source:
<https://github.com/yannrouillard/pkg-jenkins>

Can you check that it's possible to force the secure flag with an HTTP
connector?  Some load-balancer-based setups need this (although direct
HTTP connections from a browser will not work, obviously).

I can confirm you that is possible, you just have to add
'secure="true"' in the HTTP connector configuration.

Changes:

 .
   * Team upload.
 .
   [ Yann Rouillard ]
   * Added dependency on libcglib3-java to fix NoClassDefFoundError at runtime.
   * Removed Context Resource symlinks directives as they don't work anymore in
     Tomcat 8 and are not required for Jenkins (Closes: #[769594](bugreport.cgi?bug=769594))
   * Removed useless properties Debug and AllowLinking in Context definition
     to suppress warnings in Tomcat logs.
   * Backported upstream patch to ensure HttpOnly cookie flag is properly set
     and avoid warning messages about Security cookie flag (Closes: #[769682](bugreport.cgi?bug=769682))
 .
   [ Emmanuel Bourg ]
   * Documented the security issue with master/slave setups ([CVE-2014-3665](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3665))
   * Documented in /etc/default/jenkins how to run Jenkins
