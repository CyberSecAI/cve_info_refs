Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `proxy` and `cmisbrowser` servlets of Alfresco Community Edition. These servlets allow users to specify a target URL, which the server then attempts to access. Because there is no validation or restrictions on the URL, this leads to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF, allowing an attacker to make the Alfresco server connect to arbitrary URLs.
    *   **Proxy Servlet (`/alfresco/proxy`):**  This servlet directly takes a URL parameter and fetches the resource at the given location.
    *   **CMIS Browser Servlet (`/alfresco/cmisbrowser`):** This servlet also takes a URL parameter to retrieve content. Additionally, it leaks credentials if the user is tricked into accessing an authenticated resource.
*   **File URI Scheme Support:** Older versions also support the `file://` URI scheme, allowing attackers to disclose local file contents.
*  **Credential Leakage:** The cmisbrowser servlet can leak user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker can scan internal network ports to identify running services and potential attack targets.
*   **Access to Internal Applications:** An attacker can access internal web applications that are not accessible from the internet.
*   **Bypassing Access Restrictions:** The SSRF can be used to circumvent network access controls and potentially access restricted resources.
*   **Local File Disclosure:**  Using the `file://` URI scheme, the attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system (in older versions).
*   **Credential Leakage:** When a victim uses the cmisbrowser servlet, the submitted credentials can be leaked, and intercepted by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  The vulnerabilities are exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the `endpoint` parameter of the `/proxy` servlet and the `url` parameter of the `/cmisbrowser` servlet.
*   **Tricking users:** An attacker can trick a user into accessing a resource via the cmisbrowser servlet, which results in credentials being leaked in subsequent requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Alfresco server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to exploit the SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** While not strictly required, knowledge of the internal network would allow more targeted scanning and exploitation.
*  **Social Engineering:** For the credential leakage vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick the user into accessing a specific URL with the cmisbrowser servlet.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that while the `/proxy` endpoint was fixed in version 5.0.a, the `/cmisbrowser` was only commented out in the `web.xml` file. If the `cmisbrowser` is enabled, the vulnerability remains exploitable.
