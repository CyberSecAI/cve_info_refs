{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TP-Link TL-WR840N router's web administration console allows importing router configuration from a binary file. This feature is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can import a malicious configuration file to the router, altering any configuration settings, including firewall settings and remote administration capabilities. This can lead to full control of the router by the attacker.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to trick a victim (who is an administrator of the router) into visiting a malicious web page containing the CSRF exploit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to host a malicious web page and socially engineer the victim to visit the page. The attacker does not need to know the current login credentials if the device owner has not changed the default username and password."
