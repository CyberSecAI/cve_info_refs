Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-9226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple bypasses in the default security protection policies of the Symantec Data Center Security: Server Advanced (SDCS:SA) client. These policies fail to adequately prevent various malicious activities, such as arbitrary code execution, credential theft, and privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Policy Bypass:** The default policies are insufficient in preventing malicious actions, due to incorrect assumptions about how the OS functions and how certain tools are used
*   **Persistent Code Execution:** Attackers can achieve persistent code execution by exploiting the way Windows services handle files with extensions other than ".exe"
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Remote code execution can be achieved via RPC using tools like 'psexec'
*   **Credential Theft:** The policy allows extraction of Windows passwords/hashes using tools like mimikatz.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate privileges by exploiting the Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) and Windows Management Instrumentation (.mof files).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the client systems, leading to complete compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain elevated privileges, allowing further control over the system.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal Windows passwords and hashes, which can be used for lateral movement and further attacks.
*   **Persistence:** Attackers can establish persistence on the system, allowing them to maintain access even after system reboots.
*   **Remote System Compromise:** Via psexec style attacks remote code execution is possible
*   **Lateral Movement:** Once a client machine is compromised, it can be used to further move through the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Windows Services:** Exploiting the way Windows services handle non ".exe" binaries to achieve persistent code execution.
*   **RPC:** Modifying existing tools to perform remote code execution via RPC.
*   **Malicious Tools:** Using tools such as 'mimikatz' to extract passwords/hashes.
*   **Windows Installer (msiexec.exe):** Creating a malicious service that abuses msiexec.exe to execute arbitrary .msi files.
*   **Windows Management Instrumentation (.mof files):** Deploying malicious .mof files to gain code execution on older Windows versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Windows Administrator Permissions:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. This is often the case in SDCS:SA deployments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the provided mitigations by Symantec were not verified by SEC Consult.
*   The vulnerability affects Symantec Data Center Security: Server Advanced (SDCS:SA) client and also potentially the Symantec Critical System Protection (SCSP) client.
*   The report provides proof-of-concept examples for several bypasses.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in 2014-09-19 by Stefan Viehb√∂ck of SEC Consult.
