{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `__media_device_enum_links` function in the Linux kernel's media subsystem did not properly clear stack memory when copying data to user space. Specifically, the `media_pad_desc` and `media_link_desc` structs had uninitialized members, leading to information leakage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage",
       "Use of uninitialized stack memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data from the kernel's stack by reading the uninitialized memory regions. This could include kernel pointers or other sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local unprivileged user could trigger the vulnerable function via the `media` subsystem's ioctls.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to execute code locally and use media device ioctls.",
    "additional_details": "The fix implemented was to add `memset` calls to zero out the `media_pad_desc` and `media_link_desc` structs before copying them to user space, preventing the information leak."
