Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `okjson` library's parsing of numbers, specifically how it handles scientific notation. The original code attempted to convert scientific notation to floating-point numbers which was a computationally expensive operation leading to a DoS. The fix removes this scientific notation conversion and treats those strings as strings and not numbers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary vulnerability is that the vulnerable code could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by providing a large number in scientific notation which resulted in a long calculation time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS:** An attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash by submitting specially crafted JSON data containing numbers with a large exponent. This would tie up the server in long calculations and make the server slow or unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JSON Input:** The attack vector is through crafted JSON input, where a large number with scientific notation would be parsed by `okjson` in a computationally expensive manner. Any application using the vulnerable versions of raven-ruby and parsing user-controlled JSON could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send JSON data:** The attacker needs to be able to send JSON data to an application that uses the vulnerable `okjson` library. This could be via a web API, message queue or any other mechanism where JSON is parsed.
*   **No special privileges are needed:** No specific privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability other than access to an endpoint that processes user-provided JSON with the vulnerable library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Github commit shows the removal of scientific notation handling in `okjson.rb` to fix this vulnerability.
*   The seclists.org email confirms that the CVE ID CVE-2014-9490 has been assigned to this vulnerability.
*   The affected versions were 0.6.0 and newer, and the fix was introduced in version 0.12.2.
