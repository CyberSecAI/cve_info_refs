Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `Special:TemplateSandbox` feature in the TemplateSandbox extension for MediaWiki did not require an edit token when raw HTML was enabled (`$wgRawHtml = true`). This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the `Special:TemplateSandbox` page when raw HTML is enabled due to lack of edit token validation.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input within the `Special:TemplateSandbox` feature

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- XSS attacks: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A malicious user could craft a URL that includes malicious HTML and JavaScript in the `text` parameter of `Special:TemplateSandbox` and send it to a victim
- By tricking the user into accessing this malicious URL the JavaScript payload will execute in the context of the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs knowledge that `$wgRawHtml` is enabled on the target MediaWiki instance.
- No specific user permissions are mentioned, but the attacker would likely need to convince a user to load the malicious URL, or manipulate the Mediawiki installation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by requiring a POST request with an edit token when `$wgRawHtml` is set, preventing the injection of malicious scripts through URL parameters.
- Patches were created for multiple branches of the TemplateSandbox extension.
