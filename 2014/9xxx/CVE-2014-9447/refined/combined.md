This is an HTTPS browser problem, that I have hit elsewhere. I routinely use Opera because it is also my e-mail client (& does IRC). All the bug Fedora links got bounced, so I could not follow them. Having to use Firefox (again). But thanks for the details.  Reverting to the pre-update elfutils pkgs (0.157-3.1), following the test given in Comment *3* gives a slightly different 'bad' result:  $ printf '!<arch>\n%-48s%-10s`\n//file/\n%-48s%-10s`\n' // 8 /1 0 > test.a  $ eu-ar -xv test.a  x - /file  eu-ar: cannot rename temporary file to : Permission denied  Updating from Updates Testing to:  elfutils-0.157-3.2.mga4  lib64elfutils1-0.157-3.2.mga4 yields the 'good' result from [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=15085#c3):-  $ eu-ar -xv test.a  x -   eu-ar: cannot rename temporary file to : No such file or directory  For the suggestions in [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15085#c4): first, no man entries. Do <command> -? or <command> --help. From /usr/bin I tried a few on selected files, but cannot judge the output.  So I am OKing this, but David had better check this comment for the pre-update 'bad' result. ```  ---   Whiteboard: has\_procedure MGA4-32-OK => has\_procedure MGA4-32-OK MGA4-64-OK  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=15085#c6)  David Walser    2015-01-20 12:20:34 CET  ``` Yes it's fine, you just ran your test in a different directory than I did.  I ran mine on /tmp, which is a different filesystem than /, so it gives an error about not being able to create a hardlink that crosses filesystem bounds.  You ran yours on the / filesystem so it just gives permission denied because you're not root. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=15085#c7)  claire robinson    2015-01-20 15:44:11 CET  ``` Well done Lewis.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.
