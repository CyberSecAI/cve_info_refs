Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation of the `rate` parameter in the `picture.php` file. Specifically, the application was not validating the `rate` parameter before using it in a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection. The fix introduced a regular expression check to ensure the `rate` is numeric. Also, the in_array check was not reliable when comparing string (user input) and numeric values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `rate` parameter of the `picture.php` page.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
- The `in_array` function was not performing reliable checks due to comparisons between string and numeric values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Public Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website.
- **Confidential Data Leakage:** Sensitive information from the database could be exposed.
- **Database Server Compromise:** Full control over the database server might be achieved.
- **Client System Compromise:** By using the compromised website as a launching point, attackers could potentially target and compromise client systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `picture.php` with a malicious `rate` parameter.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Piwigo installation.
- **HTTP Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of basic HTTP protocol to craft the malicious POST request.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** Knowledge about SQL injection techniques is necessary to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Piwigo versions up to and including 2.6.0.
- The advisory confirms the vulnerability is present in the `picture.php` file through the `rate` parameter.
- The proof of concept uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability, showing how to inject SQL and extract database information.
- The fix involves adding a check using `preg_match` to ensure that the rate is a number and ensuring reliable `in_array` checks.
