Users can preview:

You can control the file extensions users can upload. For instance, jpg, pdf, bmp and so on.

The plugin places no restriction on this, so **you can enable any file extension you wish**.

Learn more: [CM Download (CMDM) – Downloads – File Extensions and Download / Upload Types](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/75-cmdm-downloads-type-and-setting).

### What is included in the download page?

Some of the elements:

* Description, author, tags, changelog
* Thumbnail, screenshots and slideshow
* Dedicated discussion forum
* View and download count
* Social share buttons
* Media preview
* Up to two custom fields

Learn more: [CM Download (CMDM) – Theme – Download Page Customization](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1384-cm-download-cmdm-theme-download-page-customization).

### Does each download page include a dedicated forum?

Yes. Every download page can have a space for question and answers. They are added automatically.

The support forum sends notifications for new messages to the user who posted the downloads and also let users who posted a message to follow any answers posted.

You can also integrate it with the [CM Answers plugin](https://www.cminds.com/cm-answer-store-page-content/) and instead of the built-in support forum use the CM Answer forum which is much more advanced. To read more about the integration with the CM Answers forum [click here](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/528-cm-download-cmdm-cm-answers-as-a-support-forum).

Learn more: [CM Download (CMDM) – Extras – Support Forum](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1387-cm-download-cmdm-extras-support-forum).

### Is there a way that users can download files without logging in?

Sure. Only users who need to upload files or users who want to post a support question in the downloads dedicated forum need to log in. All other users can download files without logging in.

You can define access permission for each download or for all downloads in the plugin settings. Access permissions can limit which download is visible for which user.

### How do I restrict downloads access to specific user groups?

The first thing to do is to adjust the plugin to support logged in users only. Then, under user groups, you can create different groups and specify which users belong in which group.

Next, when creating a new file for download, you can assign each file to a specific user group. Users in that group will be able to view and download the file, while all other users will be denied access.

### Is it possible to upload zip folders to the downloads directory?

Absolutely! If you want to allow users to upload multiple files to your downloads directory, for example a bunch of software files or musical tracks, zip folders will provide the ultimate solution. They will save you and your users both time and storage space.

Zip folders can easily be created on your computer and then uploaded and downloaded either individually or in bulk.

[![example of zip folder download type- CM downloads manager plugin for wordpress](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![example of zip folder download type- CM downloads manager plugin for wordpress](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![example of zip folder download type- CM downloads manager plugin for wordpress](https://www.cminds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-05-10_09-14-05.png)](https://www.cminds.com/wp-content/uploads/2015-05-10_09-14-05.png)

### Which file extensions can users preview?

Users can preview:

* **Documents (using Google Docs)** – doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, pdf, pages, ai, psd, tiff, dxf.
* **Audio and Video (using embedded players)** – mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, wma, web, flv, rtmp.
### Interface Questions

### Can I add screenshots and thumbnails to my downloads?

Yes to both. You can add them from your computer or from a URL.

Learn more: [CM Download (CMDM) – Downloads – Setting Images as Thumbnails](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1975-cm-download-cmdm-downloads-using-images-as-thumbnails).

### Can I add custom CSS to my downloads landing pages?

Yes. In the plugin setting you have a tab for custom css where downloads landing pages as well as the general downloads directory can be customized to suit your theme. This will enable you to change css on the fly.

You can also rewrite css in your theme css using the same classes and making sure it loads after the plugin css.

The last option is to edit the plugin css located in /view/resources but this is not recommended since each time we update the plugin you will need to review your changes.

### Integration With Other Plugins/Services

### How does the BuddyPress integration work?

Performing the CM [Downloads Manager](https://www.cminds.com/blog/wordpress/top-download-manager-plugins-wordpress/) and BuddyPress integration allows your users to quickly login to your file sharing directory using their BuddyPress profile.

This is recommended for site that use the BuddyPress forum system and want to add a file sharing option.

### How does the integration with CM MicroPayments work?

It allows users to pay or receive points, with real or virtual value, by uploading or downloading files.

For example, when a user comes to purchase a digital good on your stores – such as a music file or a software zip – they will be charged with points that in turn will be taken off their digital wallet.

### Technical Questions

### Where does the WordPress Download Manager Plugin store files?

Our plugins take advantage of the existing WordPress features to provide the plugins’ functionality.

* The text, metadata and settings are stored in the **WordPress database**.
* Static files like images, JS, CSS used by the plugin are stored in the **plugins directory**.
* The users’ files uploaded when working with the plugin are stored in the plugin-specific folder inside the **wp-content/uploads** directory.

With Download and File Manager you can also add links as files. That means you can add the URL of a file hosted by Google Drive or Box as a download.

Data isn’t lost after removing the plugin. However moving the plugin’s data between two different websites can be very difficult because of the IDs associated with each other as the foreign keys.

Learn more: [General Support – WordPress – Where the plugin data is being stored – CreativeMinds Products Documentation](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/article/1398-where-the-plugins-data-is-being-stored).

### What is the maximum file size in the WordPress Download and File Manager plugin?

The plugin doesn’t set any limit, so that depends on your server settings. Please refer to your web admin to learn more.

### Is it possible to localize the Download and File Manager for languages that don't appear on the list?

Language files are located under the /lang directory in the plugin. You can take any existing .po file and change the non English description to your custom language. You can then use a po to mo converter like in here http://po2mo.net/ to create the mo file.

Here is an example of how the original English text and the translation look in the po file

  Awesome!

  I found this plugin and loved the fact that you can divide downloads into categories and the simple design. It was all i needed actually. Sadly the original design was over the whole page. And because i have a sidebar on my site the download section wasnt visible.
  But! I contacted the creators via the support forum and explained my problem. A tiny bit later they had the option to choose yourself where the download button will appear. So my problem was solved and now i can use the plugin!

  Amazing! 😀

  Wonderful Plugin!

  I purchased the Pro version and have it customized with some “Customized Hours” from Creative Mind (to have a tailor-made design that fit perfectly with my client’s request), and I’ve been delighted with the result!

  The website is now online (I prefer post a review when the website is finish to avoid getting a first, wrong impression; as it’s too often the case) and counts now 133 documents (and still growing).

  Both my client and I are very satisfied with the result: no glitch, fast loading, effective query,responsive design… The support team and the sell team happened to be very reactive and effective as well (and on time!).

  Some may say that some functions are confusing (e.g. the menu, the interface) but I believe that each plugin has its own very way of working, and when you get to understand this one, it will just do all what you expect it to!

  I surely recommend this plugin for anyone who wish to have a Searchable Database, or an Online Library (you name it as you want); the balance price/quality is more than fair.

  PS: I am a web-designer, not a web-developer, so the simplicity and the effectiveness of a plugin is crucial for me (please, spare me the coding!). I have this plugin customized, but I believe the Pro version would work just as well out of the box.

  Good multifunctional plugin and good support

  This plugin is multifunctional and very good.

  I wanted to…

  1.get download items list
  2.view graph of download items(I wanted day and month)
  3.get csv file of download data

  This plugin satisfied that.
  (And it has more functions.)

  And when it work not good, I mail to the dev team.
  It has been supported so kindly and quickly 🙂

  Great shortcode & super fast support help

  I was really impressed how quickly the support team gave me a hand to fix stuff. I am a designer, so sometime my requests are very fussy. However the support team made all of my requests done so quickly. The end result looks amazing. Not only visually, but the plugin’s functionality works so smooth and user friendly. I’m a very happy customer. If anyone looking for download plugin, I recommend CM download manager!

  Useful plugin and great support

  I have tried several file manager plugins for WordPress. CM Download Manager
  is by far the best plugin that I have tried, and the pro version does have a lot of options.

  And, importantly, great and fast support

  Useful product – great support

  I’ve purchased my fair share of plugins for WordPress over the years and have often come up against the brick-wall of plugin support – but not so with this group. Even after 11 months, this group is just as interested in helping me as they were day-one. This is certainly a pleasant surprise.

  So far, they have also been very helpful in listening to feedback and feature requests. I’ve been very pleased with their support. If my clients have need for any of their products, I wouldn’t hesitate to order again.

  Fantastic plugin – Easy to set up and use

  What a great plug in cmdownloads is and what fantastic support. I needed to create an online document archive, viewable by the public but which members could upload to without logging into the WordPress backend – this plugin does all that and looks great.
  I have been running the pro version for the past six months and any issues or question I have had have been answered quickly by support and they have not hesitated to go into my admin area and sort out the problem.

  The plugin is easy to set up with lots of configurable options and widgets and shortcodes.

  Great plugin!

  This is a very good and useful plugin! I have used the Pro-version for a while and it is really good. I have also received very good support from the developers.

  Easy to use/setup plugin – and developer support is AWESOME!

  This was the perfect solution for what we needed in a file management plugin for WordPress. Not only is it easy for the web designer to setup but also easy enough that the end user/client can upload their own files after 30 minutes of training by me. What really was a pleasant surprise was how quickly the developer Creative Minds answered my questions and are open to suggestions for improvements to the plugin. To me that is worth the price of the plugin!

  I’m only using half of the features this plugin has so there is plenty of room to grow if the client wishes. I would (and have) highly recommend this plugin to anyone looking for a simple yet robust file management system for WordPress.

  Easy to use

  I have a WordPress website and needed a way to easily manage downloads and allow other people to access different documents and CM Download Manager does that. It is quick and easy to download and getting it set up and started didn’t take much time. I love that it gives me the downloads in a directory listing so it is easy to manage. I am able to see who downloads documents and how many times documents have been downloaded. CM Download Manager has helped my site become more organized and has made it easier for me to run a website.

  Just what I was looking for

  Upgraded to the pro edition for the shortcodes, formats and the BuddyPress integration.

  The customization is pretty cool as well as the file preview feature. Great experience so far. Very simple and efficient.

  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a download manager plugin.

  Great Experience!

  I have had an amazing experience so far with CM Download Manager. I have a blog on WordPress and it was getting exhausting running it by myself. CM Download Manager allows me to have the ability to be able to have multiple users log in and they are able to access all of the different sets of documents that I have laid out to each one of them. It’s nice that I can set up individual files for each one and they are each able to access their own specific files.

  On my blog, I post a lot of files that users are downloading. This plugin has made the process that much easier. It’s so easy to use and it’s working great for me so far.

  CM Download Manager has kept me organized. The support team has been great in aiding me with any questions that I have. Great plugin that does what it’s supposed to!

  Really Helps to Keep me Organized!

  I have had a WordPress site for a few months now, but what I was lacking was a good Download Manager plugin. My site was very unorganized as a result, and I knew I needed to do something to fix my issues. I came across the CM Downloads Manager, and really liked what it had to offer.

  Downloading and installing the plugin was extremely quick and stress free. Very easy to intergrate onto WordPress; you don’t have to be a computer tech to do it. I noticed quite a few things that I really liked right away; first of all, you have the ability to upload, manage, and track files in a directory listing format, allowing others to be able to easily use and comment on. You can specify which users have the ability to use these features as well, which is a huge plus. You also have the ability to preview music you want before downloading it – love this feature! You also have the ability to customize the look and feel of it, which I have already done.

  Since downloading the CM Downloads Manager and using it for awhile on my WordPress, I have to say that I’m extremely pleased. It really helps to keep everything in order, and It’s not buggy at all (unlike some other plugins I’ve tried). I would highly recommend this one!

  Excellent Plug in

  I manage a website using WordPress, and I needed an efficient way to upload files. I wanted a plugin that would allow other website admins to upload documents, and to manage what users are able to download these files. In the past, I did not have an acceptable solution for this, and since I had control of all of the files to be uploaded, it became solely my job; the other admins had to ask me to upload files. I felt like I was doing everything to manage a website that I was already paying others to assist with.

  I currently have the free version of the CM Download Manager Plug In, and I am very happy with it. I am pleased that there is no limitation on downloads, since I have chosen to make most of my uploaded files public. I have the ability to see how many views each file is getting, as well as votes for each user download.

  The index where I manage my downloads has lots of useful features that allow me to sort my downloads based upon the particular stats I am looking for, such as by upload date, popularity of the download, and more. This helps me to evaluate my site’s success better.

  I am definitely happy with how this plugin has helped to increase my productivity and has changed the way upload files on my website. I am definitely considering purchasing the paid version; with all of the extra features, I’m certain that my website could benefit greatly.

  Its very helpful

  My WordPress website was driving me crazy. I am not a computer tech and had difficult time to manage my website. I was introduced to use CM Download Manager by my website builder. I have loved it since then. It has simple and user friendly interface, which allows multiple users to login and I am able to assign different accessibilities to each of them. Now I am no longer the only one doing the work. At the same time, it helps us work even closer together and more efficiency. I am also amazed by their customer support, whenever we have questions, they are there to help and answer. Cm Download Manager does help us running the website a lot. I recommend it highly.

  Download plugin that is reliable and easy to use!

  I have been using CM Download Manager for a couple of months now. I needed a plug in that would allow me to have multiple users, each with access to a different set of documents. CM Downloads allows me to do just that!

  Not only am I happy with the product, but the support is amazing. When ever I have a questions, or can’t figure something out, the support team gets back to me in a very timely fashion. They are also understanding and patient. I’m new to website building, and I’m sure I ask many silly questions. The support team has always treated me with respect, no matter how confused I am :).

  Over all, if your website will have users downloading files, this is the plugin you need. Looks great, easy to use user interface. Quick to load, and keeps you up to date on file downloads. Very happy, thanks CMPlugins!
