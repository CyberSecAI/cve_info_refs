Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-9029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2014-9029 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the JasPer library. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox()` and `jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn()` functions when decoding JPEG 2000 image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to improper input sanitization, a crafted JPEG2000 file can cause the allocated heap buffer to overflow when processed by affected functions.
- Off-by-one error: Incorrect bounds checking on component numbers during the decoding process, specifically when processing COC, RGN, and QCC marker segments. This leads to out-of-bounds memory access during array indexing.
- Double free: A double-free vulnerability was identified in the `jas_iccattrval_destroy()` function when processing ICC color profiles in JPEG 2000 image files, stemming from improper resource management during error conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of the buffer overflow can result in:
- Denial of Service (DoS): The application using JasPer crashes.
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through specially crafted JPEG 2000 (`.jp2`) image files. By tricking a user or a service to process such a malicious image file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted JPEG2000 file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable JasPer library.
- No specific user interaction is required beyond a user or service opening or processing the malicious file.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability in some reported cases, where remote unauthenticated exploitation was possible.
- In some cases, the exploitation requires user interaction

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `jasper <= 1.900.1`.
- Patches were contributed by Tomas Hoger from Red Hat Product Security, who addressed the off-by-one error with adjustments in the checks to ensure that `compno >= numcomps` fails instead of `compno > numcomps`.
- The issue affects various Linux distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Mageia, Red Hat, and Slackware.
- The vulnerability was originally discovered by Josh Duart of the Google Security Team.
- Some of the documents mention the fix was integrated upstream in version 1.900.2.
- A Red Hat advisory mentions that a specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code, further clarifying the severity and impact of this issue.
- The oCERT advisory specifies that the vulnerability is present in functions `jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox()` and `jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn()`.

The information from the different sources is generally consistent, highlighting the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability and its potential consequences. The Red Hat documentation and the oCERT advisory provide the most technical details on the vulnerable functions and the nature of the fix.
