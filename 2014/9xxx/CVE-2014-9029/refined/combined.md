# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  13 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2018), [My Oracle Support Note 2379675.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2379675.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

Package        : jasper
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9029
Debian Bug     : 772036

Josh Duart of the Google Security Team discovered heap-based buffer
overflow flaws in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files,
which could lead to denial of service (application crash) or the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated jasper packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JasPer is an implementation of Part 1 of the JPEG 2000 image compression
standard.

Multiple off-by-one flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were
found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted
file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-9029)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG
2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using
JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138)

A double free flaw was found in the way JasPer parsed ICC color profiles in
JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8137)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter.

All JasPer users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All applications using
the JasPer libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-25 02:57:55 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was reported in JasPer's jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox() and jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn() functions. Processing a specially-crafted image with an application that uses JasPer could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-27 11:55:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This seems to be an off-by-one issue in jpc_dec_process_coc and jpc_dec_process_rgn.  There are an existing checks to ensure if coc->compno / rgn->compno is not more than dec->numcomps.  The reason is that compno is later used as index to jpc_dec_cp_t's ccps[] array, which is allocated to have numcomps entries.  However, compno == numcomps is already out of allocated bounds, and the checks should be adjusted to error out when compno >= numcomps, rather than when compno > numcomps.  There is similar issue in jpc_dec_process_qcc which is also corrected by this patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c4)  Jiri Popelka    2014-11-27 13:23:03 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Patch looks good to me.

# USN-2434-1: JasPer vulnerability

8 December 2014

JasPer could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) - Library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files

## Details

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

  -
  [1.900.1-13ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/jasper/1.900.1-13ubuntu0.1)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-25 02:57:55 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was reported in JasPer's jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox() and jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn() functions. Processing a specially-crafted image with an application that uses JasPer could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-27 11:55:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This seems to be an off-by-one issue in jpc_dec_process_coc and jpc_dec_process_rgn.  There are an existing checks to ensure if coc->compno / rgn->compno is not more than dec->numcomps.  The reason is that compno is later used as index to jpc_dec_cp_t's ccps[] array, which is allocated to have numcomps entries.  However, compno == numcomps is already out of allocated bounds, and the checks should be adjusted to error out when compno >= numcomps, rather than when compno > numcomps.  There is similar issue in jpc_dec_process_qcc which is also corrected by this patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c4)  Jiri Popelka    2014-11-27 13:23:03 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Patch looks good to me.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-25 02:57:55 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was reported in JasPer's jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox() and jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn() functions. Processing a specially-crafted image with an application that uses JasPer could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-27 11:55:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This seems to be an off-by-one issue in jpc_dec_process_coc and jpc_dec_process_rgn.  There are an existing checks to ensure if coc->compno / rgn->compno is not more than dec->numcomps.  The reason is that compno is later used as index to jpc_dec_cp_t's ccps[] array, which is allocated to have numcomps entries.  However, compno == numcomps is already out of allocated bounds, and the checks should be adjusted to error out when compno >= numcomps, rather than when compno > numcomps.  There is similar issue in jpc_dec_process_qcc which is also corrected by this patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c4)  Jiri Popelka    2014-11-27 13:23:03 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Patch looks good to me.

Package        : jasper
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9029
Debian Bug     : 772036

Josh Duart of the Google Security Team discovered heap-based buffer
overflow flaws in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files,
which could lead to denial of service (application crash) or the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1173157#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 14:54:47 UTC  ``` oCERT reports a double-free issue in jas_iccattrval_destroy() in jasper:    In jas_icctxt_input() if there's an error, there's a call to   jas_free(txt->string) which is freeing attrval->data.txt, but later on   jas_iccattrval_destroy it tries to call free on it again.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1173157#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 15:23:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967282](attachment.cgi?id=967282&action=diff "Possible patch - variant 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967282&action=edit "Possible patch - variant 1") Possible patch - variant 1  This uses somewhat conservative approach.  It changes iccattrvalinfo destroy ops functions to set variables to NULL after free(), so even if called repeatedly, double-free is avoided.  It also changes jas_icctxt_input() to call jas_icctxt_destroy() on error, rather than performing memory freeing directly.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1173157#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 15:28:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967283](attachment.cgi?id=967283&action=diff "Possible patch - variant 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967283&action=edit "Possible patch - variant 2") Possible patch - variant 2  This removes jas_icc*_destroy() calls from error code paths in iccattrvalinfo input ops functions (jas_icc*_input()).  This should not introduce any memory leak, as input ops functions only seem to be called from jas_iccprof_load(), and if they return error, jas_iccattrval_destroy() gets called, which leads to destroy op call.          if ((*attrval->ops->input)(attrval, in, len)) {             goto error;         }    ...  error:   ...     if (attrval)         jas_iccattrval_destroy(attrval);   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1173157#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 15:31:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967284](attachment.cgi?id=967284&action=diff "Additional fix to avoid assert() abort") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967284&action=edit "Additional fix to avoid assert() abort") Additional fix to avoid assert() abort  If one of the above patches is applied, assert(iccprof) is triggered in jp2_decode(), aborting application using jasper.  This fix makes jasper fail more gracefully.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1173157#c5)  Jiri Popelka    2014-12-11 17:17:53 UTC  ``` All patches look good to me.

# USN-2434-2: Ghostscript vulnerability

8 December 2014

Ghostscript could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [ghostscript](/security/cves?package=ghostscript) - PostScript and PDF interpreter

## Details

USN-2434-1 fixed a vulnerability in JasPer. This update provides the

corresponding fix for the JasPer library embedded in the Ghostscript

package.

Original advisory details:

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libgs8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ghostscript)
  -
  [8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ghostscript/8.71.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.6)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
