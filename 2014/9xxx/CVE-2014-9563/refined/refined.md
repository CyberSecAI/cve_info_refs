- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input parameters passed from the web interface to the "chpasswd" command, used for resetting passwords, are not correctly validated. This allows an attacker to set passwords for more privileged system users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the admin web interface can set passwords for privileged system users (e.g., root), gaining unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs access to the administrative web interface of the Siemens OpenStage VoIP phone. A specifically crafted POST request can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface and be able to authenticate as an administrative user.
