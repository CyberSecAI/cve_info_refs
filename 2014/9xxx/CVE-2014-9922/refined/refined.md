{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The kernel lacked a limit on the depth of stacked filesystems, which could lead to kernel stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled recursion in filesystem stacking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could cause a denial-of-service by triggering a kernel stack overflow, potentially leading to system instability or crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker could recursively stack filesystems, exceeding the stack limit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system with the ability to mount filesystems."
