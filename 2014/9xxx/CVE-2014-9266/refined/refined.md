**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to initialize a variable within the `STWConfig` ActiveX control before it's used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Uninitialized variable leading to memory corruption or other undefined behavior when exploited.
*   ActiveX control vulnerability, which can be exploited through malicious web pages or files.

*   The attacker needs no prior authentication or special access to the system other than the victim browsing to the malicious page or opening the malicious file.
*   The attacker needs to craft the malicious content to exploit the uninitialized variable in the ActiveX control.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that Samsung has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via Digital Vaccine filter ID 16531.
