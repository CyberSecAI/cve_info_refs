- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the `BackupToAvi` method of the Samsung SmartViewer CNC\_Ctrl ActiveX control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the failure to validate the size of the input buffer before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, requiring the target to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file. User interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or file, which the victim must interact with. The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges on the victim's machine.
