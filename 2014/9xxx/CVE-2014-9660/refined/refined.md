Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-9660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `_bdf_parse_glyphs` function in the `bdf/bdflib.c` file of the FreeType library.
*   Specifically, the code doesn't properly handle a missing `ENDCHAR` record within a BDF font file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When an `ENDCHAR` record is missing, the code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted BDF font file lacking an `ENDCHAR` record can cause an application using FreeType to crash due to the NULL pointer dereference.
*  **Unspecified Other Impact:**  The CVE description also mentions "possibly have unspecified other impact".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a maliciously crafted BDF font file using an application that relies on the FreeType library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create or obtain a BDF font file that lacks an `ENDCHAR` record.
*   The attacker must then persuade a user to open this malicious font file with a vulnerable application

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk
*   The fix for this issue was included in FreeType version 2.5.4.
*   Various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, have issued security advisories and updates to address this and other related FreeType vulnerabilities.
*   Red Hat also mentions this issue affects their  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 product lines (through RHSA-2015:0696).
