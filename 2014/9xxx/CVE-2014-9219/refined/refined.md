Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the redirection mechanism of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize the URL provided via the `$_GET['url']` parameter before using it in a JavaScript redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the phpMyAdmin application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Defacing the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL. The attacker would need to get a user to visit a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript in the 'url' parameter and entice a phpMyAdmin user to visit this URL.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `url.php` file.
*   The fix implemented in commit `9b2479b7216dd91a6cc2f231c0fd6b85d457f6e2` involved replacing `htmlspecialchars()` with `PMA_escapeJsString()` for escaping the URL within the JavaScript redirect.
*   The fix was included in phpMyAdmin version 4.2.13.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Manuel Fernandez of ElevenPaths.
*   The associated CWEs are CWE-661 (Improper Handling of Overly Long Sequences) and CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content gives a good amount of detail regarding the vulnerability and how it was resolved.
* The vulnerability is described as "non-critical" by phpMyAdmin team which might be an underestimation as XSS can have critical implications.
