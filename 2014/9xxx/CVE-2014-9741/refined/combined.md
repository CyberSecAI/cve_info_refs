### Summary

This patch addresses editing workflows which can introduce network inconsistencies to a geometric network.

### Description

Esri® announces the ArcGIS for (Desktop, Engine, Server) Geometric Network Geoprocessing Update Patch. This patch addresses editing workflows which can introduce network inconsistencies into the logical network associated with a Geometric Network. The fixes prevent the editing workflows using Geoprocessing or ArcObjects from introducing inconsistencies. This patch also updates the Verify and Repair Geometric Network tools on the Geometric Network Editing Toolbar and their matching Geoprocessing tools to identify networks which have the specific MaxEID corruption present, the tools are also able to fix these inconsistencies when they are detected. It deals specifically with the issues listed below under [Issues Addressed with this patch](#bugs).

### Issues Addressed with this patch

* BUG-000086192 - Loading data into a Geometric network Feature Class using arcpy.Append\_management in Python can result in corrupted network features.
* BUG-000086943 - The Verify, Repair and Rebuild Connectivity Tools need to identify and fix the max EID corruption problems.

   Description: Please see Technical Article ["Error: Cannot rebuild network connectivity. A network feature has a network element whose id is larger than the maximum eid value in the PROPS table"](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000012395) for further information.

To avoid conflicts with existing patches, the patch also addresses these additional issues for the listed versions:

* NIM102761 - When the Migrate Relationship Class gp tool is run on an attachment relationship class, attachments are no longer attached to the features.
* NIM102517 - Decrease the size of the delta being downloaded to improve performance of download time on sync.

* NIM100941 - Improve the Performance and Scalability of Creating and Syncing replicas by more efficiently caching database information.
* NIM100845 - Mosaic dataset performance in PostgreSQL suffers when an ArcGIS for Server map service containing it is under load and Python is used to add new rasters to the mosaic dataset using arcpy.AddRastersToMosaicDataset\_management.
* NIM100697 - Change the "\_VW" suffix to "\_EVW" when versioned views are created, in order to be consistent the EVW naming convention when we create MV views.
* NIM100692 - Filter out multi-versioned views from the list of objects returned by SE\_table\_list\_tables().
* NIM100503 - Loading a very large shape (>15k points) followed by small shape results in ORA-28579: error.
* NIM100273 - Views get overwritten during register as versioned if a view / versioned view of same name exists.
* NIM100141 - Missing index on the SDE versions table results in full table scan.
