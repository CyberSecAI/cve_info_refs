The provided content is related to CVE-2014-9789.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Qualcomm components, specifically a flaw in the kernel, related to the handling of audio. The vulnerability is triggered during interaction with the audio driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm audio driver within the kernel allows a local malicious application to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel, potentially leading to a permanent device compromise and requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack vectors:**
A local malicious application is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
The malicious application must be able to trigger the specific vulnerable code path in the kernel driver, which likely involves making specific calls related to audio processing or functionality.
