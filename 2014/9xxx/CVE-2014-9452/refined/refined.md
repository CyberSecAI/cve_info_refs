  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-9452",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in VDG Security SENSE (formerly DIVA) software.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unauthenticated local file disclosure",
        "Authentication bypass",
        "Clear text password disclosure",
        "Insecure service configuration",
        "Hardcoded default credentials for PostgreSQL",
        "Hardcoded default credentials for Windows Users",
        "Critical information disclosure / User database leakage",
         "Use of plain text protocols",
        "Buffer overflow vulnerabilities"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can completely compromise the VDG SENSE server, gain system level access, use it as an entry point for lateral movement and privilege escalation, and access sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing the web service API",
        "Network access to vulnerable services",
         "Exploiting the proprietary protocol",
         "Unauthenticated access to the web server"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service or access to the local system where VDG SENSE is installed. No authentication is required for some of the vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely using unauthenticated requests, while some require the attacker to use the DIVA protocol (TCP port 51410). Exploiting the buffer overflow would require specific knowledge of the stack layout since ASLR is not enabled."
