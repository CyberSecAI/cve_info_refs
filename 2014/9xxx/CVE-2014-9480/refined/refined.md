Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9480:

**CVE Description:**
The vulnerability is in the `Hovercards` extension of MediaWiki. It's caused by an XSS vulnerability present in the text extracts.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of text extracts within the Hovercards extension. Specifically, the extension used `.html()` to insert content into the page, without escaping HTML entities, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript. The vulnerable code was introduced by this change: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/132707/

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the injection of malicious scripts due to unsanitized text extracts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential for Account Takeover: The execution of malicious JavaScript could lead to session hijacking or other actions that could compromise user accounts.
- Data Theft: Attackers can potentially access sensitive data through XSS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious Link: An attacker crafts a link that, when hovered over, displays a hovercard containing malicious content.
- Crafted Content: Malicious content is inserted into a page, which is then extracted by the Hovercards extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit pages with malicious wikitext content.
- An attacker can use existing pages if there are already unsanitized elements on them.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically related to the text extracts of the `Hovercards` extension.
- The vulnerability exists because the text extracts are rendered using `.html()` without proper escaping.
- The fix involves using `mw.html.escape` to sanitize the text extracts before displaying them, or using DOM manipulation with `.text()`.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) was demonstrated by linking to a specific user's script page: `[[User:Stype & Co. (WMF)/scripts]]`
