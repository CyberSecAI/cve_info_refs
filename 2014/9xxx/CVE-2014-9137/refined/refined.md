- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the web interface of multiple Huawei products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerabilities allow an attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device with the privileges of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the device, compromise legitimate services, and perform other malicious activities by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to persuade an authenticated user of the affected device to follow a malicious link or visit a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication to trigger the vulnerability, but an authenticated user needs to be logged into the device and tricked to visit the malicious link/website.
