Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `uloc_getDisplayName` function within the ICU (International Components for Unicode) library. Specifically, the internal function `ures_getByKeyWithFallback` uses a fixed-size 256-byte buffer on the stack. This function appends a user-supplied string (`inKey`) to an existing resource path. If the combined length of the resource path and the user-supplied string exceeds 256 bytes, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is the unbounded copy of data onto a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to the possibility of overwriting adjacent memory regions.
*   **Insecure string handling:** The code uses `strcpy`, which is vulnerable to buffer overflows when the source string exceeds the destination buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The most immediate impact of a buffer overflow is a program crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While difficult, an attacker could potentially overwrite the return address on the stack to redirect program flow to malicious code if the stack canary is bypassed. The provided information suggests that the stack protector mitigates this risk to some extent, but it doesn't eliminate it entirely.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user-supplied locale string longer than 255 characters is passed to `uloc_getDisplayName`.
*   This function is used in many higher-level functions, including PHP's `locale_get_display_name` function which indirectly calls `uloc_getDisplayName`, making the vulnerability accessible through multiple points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply or control the locale string that is passed to `uloc_getDisplayName`. In the context of PHP, this could be through parameters passed to the `locale_get_display_name` function.
*   **Knowledge of Buffer Overflow:** To exploit this for more than a crash, the attacker needs knowledge of buffer overflows, stack layouts, and potentially the stack canary in order to bypass it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates that this issue affects multiple systems such as PHP and other software using the vulnerable ICU library, requiring independent fixes.
*  This vulnerability is related to CVE-2014-9912 and CVE-2016-6294 which are vulnerabilities caused by the same root cause in PHP.
