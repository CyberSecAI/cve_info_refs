The provided content does not contain any information about CVE-2014-9408. The content describes vulnerabilities in Ekahau Real-Time Location System and is related to CVE-2014-2716.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- RC4 cipher stream reuse: The same RC4 cipher stream is used to encrypt different messages, allowing an attacker to XOR two ciphertexts and reveal the bitwise difference of the plaintexts.
- Weak key derivation: The 128-bit RC4 key is derived from the three least significant bytes of the MAC address combined with a static prefix and suffix.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- RC4 cipher stream reuse
- Weak key derivation

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can read and generate arbitrary messages, including button events, text/alarm messages, and reconfiguration events.
- An attacker can recover the bitwise difference of two plain texts by XORing two ciphertexts, as a result of the same keystream being used.
- An attacker can easily reconstruct the RC4 encryption key from the MAC address and other known static data.
- The use of a weak key makes brute force attacks on the key feasible.

Attack vectors:
- Sniffing wireless network traffic to obtain MAC address of Ekahau devices.
- Intercepting and manipulating encrypted messages.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to sniff the wireless network traffic.
- Access to a captured ciphertext message.
- Access to any Ekahau tag's EEPROM or publicly available source code to know the key derivation scheme.
