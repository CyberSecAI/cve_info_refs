{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability exists in Qualcomm components, specifically a driver, that allows for arbitrary code execution within the kernel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege vulnerability in a Qualcomm component driver.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application can execute arbitrary code within the kernel, potentially leading to a local permanent device compromise requiring reflashing the operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application exploits the vulnerability in the Qualcomm driver.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a local malicious application installed on the target device."
