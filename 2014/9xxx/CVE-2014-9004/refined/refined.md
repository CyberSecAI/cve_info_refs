The provided content from Exploit Database describes multiple vulnerabilities in vldPersonals 2.7, including both XSS and SQL injection.  It references CVE-2014-9004, as well as CVE-2014-9005.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **XSS:** The application copies the value of the `id` request parameter into an HTML tag attribute without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `country`, `gender1` and `gender2` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing the malicious payload in the `id` parameter.  For example: `GET /index.php?m=member_profile&p=profile&id=9811c”><script>alert(1)</script>b7ec317c816`
*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious payload in the `country`, `gender1`, or `gender2` parameters. For example: `POST /index.php?m=search ... &country=1%20and%20benchmark(20000000%2csha1(1))--%20`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters (`id` for XSS and `country`, `gender1` and `gender2` for SQL injection).
