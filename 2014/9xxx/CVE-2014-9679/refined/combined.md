Use CVE-2014-9679 for this integer overflow that was fixed in 2.0.2.

The scope of this CVE does not include the "nothing that guarantees
that r->bpp is non-zero" observation the "Feb 1, 2015" comment.

This isn't directly relevant to whether a CVE should exist, but
<http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-2.0/man-cups-files.conf.html>
mentions 'Specifies the level of security sandboxing that is applied
to print filters, backends, and other child processes of the
scheduler. The default is "strict". This directive is currently only
used/supported on OS X.' Apparently some online discussions of CUPS
include third-party recommendations to disable sandboxing.

# USN-2520-1: CUPS vulnerability

26 February 2015

CUPS could be made to crash or run programs if it processed a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

Package        : cups
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9679
Debian Bug     : 778387

Peter De Wachter discovered that CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing
System, did not correctly parse compressed raster files. By submitting
a specially crafted raster file, a remote attacker could use this
vulnerability to trigger a buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-5+deb7u5.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7.5-11.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Try it again. For what it's worth, I'm just waiting for this ebuild to work before I create one for a21. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Nebula    2004-06-21 07:41:36 UTC  ``` Hehe, yeah, I thought that logic was skewed a bit while looking at it.  Well, you'll be thrilled to hear that it works perfectly for me.  Only suggestion I can think of is to rename the ebuild from 'stepmania-3.9-r20' to 'stepmania-3.9-a20', since it's an alpha still.  Can't wait to see this in the main portage tree!!  Also, it'd be fantastic if you could make an ebuild for the SMMAX2 theme.  I'll help test the alpha21 ebuild when you post it ;) ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Nebula    2004-06-21 08:32:03 UTC  ``` I also wanted to add...in the ebuild, you have the dependency LUA (A powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications) configured so that 5.0 must be installed.  LUA-5.0.2 is in portage now (since the 16th of March, this year), and emerge wants to update it, but I've been hesitant since the SM 3.9-r20 ebuild depends on 5.0, and LUA doesn't support SLOTs.  I just wondered if SM really depends on that version of LUA, or if you missed hitting the > symbol. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Sean Burke    2004-06-21 10:24:58 UTC  ``` Due to apparent differences in the way that lua 5.0 and lua 5.0.2 are set up, my experience has been that code before alpha21 did not compile with newer versions. This may be fixed in alpha21, but I haven't tested it as yet. I will do so and make note of it for the alpha21 ebuild. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Nebula    2004-06-23 08:24:29 UTC  ``` I edited the -r20 ebuild to have a dependency of LUA 5.0.2, and when I tried to emerge it after that, the configure failed:  ---------------------------------- checking for lua-config50... no checking for lua-config... no checking for lua_open in -llua... yes checking for luaopen_base in -llualib... no checking for luaopen_base in -llualib50... no  *** liblua is required to build StepMania; please *** make sure that liblua is installed to continue *** the installation process. make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.

We'll have to wait and see.  :) ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Nebula    2004-07-02 17:31:09 UTC  ``` since this compiles fine, would it be too much to ask to get it added into the portage tree, or do we want to wait for your alpha21 ebuild?  I would love to see this in portage, but then again, I'd love to see -a21 in portage too ;) ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  whereami    2004-08-09 06:38:28 UTC  ``` 1.) the ebuild needs "inherit eutils" at the top so that the patch will be applied.  2.) While trying to build alpha 21, i needed to add "-lw -ldl" to LDFLAGS during ./configure to get past the lua checks. (This is with 5.0.2 emerged.) I have no idea what those libs are, i just noticed them while emerging lua.  The build subsequently failed while linking to libjpeg, which i couldn't figure out (the lib is installed and in the command line). Perhaps the patch fixes that though, since this ebuild worked fine for me after i added "inherit eutils" (didn't try it without first to see, unfortunately). ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Mark Flanagan    2004-09-03 04:06:13 UTC  ``` stepmania-3.9-r22 is out, i'm working on an ebuild (its compiling - had to edit the patch as well as part of it has been applied upstream), patch applied cleanly and the ebuild was a version bump so it should work.

I also added some version info to the dependencies from the home page, and added a mask as well because it seems to me that one of the authors(?) has declared current alpha versions too unstable to be added to distro's packages (cf. [bug 38613](show_bug.cgi?id=38613 "RESOLVED UPSTREAM - stepmania fails to compile")).  ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Flammie Pirinen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-04 19:11:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 38951](attachment.cgi?id=38951 "Slightly updated ebuild for alpha version of stepmania") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=38951&action=edit "Slightly updated ebuild for alpha version of stepmania")] Slightly updated ebuild for alpha version of stepmania  Added few dependencies, keyworded. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Sean Burke    2004-09-05 14:06:10 UTC  ``` The bug you are referring to is fourteen alphas old, which is a significant amount of time considering how long alphas have been released. Furthermore, the person who posted that comment has not been an active dev for some time. A fair amount of work has been done to make the alphas more suitable for a traditional-style system install. ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Nebula    2004-09-05 14:42:09 UTC  ``` If I may add, I emerged alpha 20 (and 21) using these ebuilds, and they worked fine, the system didn't take a hit at all.  I would imagine that 10 or so alphas are enough to help out.  I also don't know why the devs call these alpha builds.  They're quite stable when I use them...I've only crashed it once or twice, and they fixed that bug in the next build.  So, I'm not going to question the devs, but it seems to me that these alpha builds are good.  I can't wait until they feel good enough to start releasing RCs or even a final.  I also should add that instead of having the ebuild name be 'stepmania-3.9-r22', it should be stepmania-3.9-a22 or stepmania-3.9-alpha22, since this is an alpha.  Unless I missed some note in the ebuild naming convention docs, I have a feeling it'd be better to mark it alpha in the name, not only so users realize what they're getting, but also because -r22 makes me believe that the gentoo devs have revised that version and published it 22 times...just a thought.  I'd love to see stepmania back in portage again.  It'll always have a home in my portage overlay ;) ```  [Comment 23](#c23)  Sean Burke    2004-09-05 15:30:21 UTC  ``` I am currently testing a new revision of the alpha20 ebuild that addresses a few issues brought up to me and uses a slightly better system of handling paths and whatnot. If it works, I'll throw it up. If it is accepted into Portage, I'll make it suitable for alphas 21 and 22 and get those added as well. ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Warp Zero (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-05 16:15:46 UTC  ``` actually it should be _alpha22 as per the portage documentation ```  [Comment 25](#c25)  Flammie Pirinen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-05 16:25:50 UTC  ``` Re [comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=53958#c22), I did rename the newest ebuild stepmania-3.9.0.22_alpha (of course I screwed up with the name of attachment). I didn't make it _alpha22 because I didn't get it working for some reason, but actually I should've substituted it 3.8.99.22_alpha anyways since that won't be greater than 3.9-final.  Regarding stability one might note though, that the package still isn't too ready for installation on system-wide location without problems. The current version seems to hack up some group-writable things and such, I don't know if it's the most proper way to handle it?   Also, when I tried it with my computer I had some X lockups (and restarts) which do not appear on same computer with Fedora Core 2 installation of binary rpm, but that might be more a problem with my system configuration (the radeon is giving me much of trouble anyways on that setup).  The locked lua version, which isn't slotted might, also be a problem, which needs to be resolved before calling package stable.  (+cc'ing myself.) ```  [Comment 26](#c26)  Sean Burke    2004-09-05 16:42:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 39013](attachment.cgi?id=39013 "stepmania-3.9_alpha20.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=39013&action=edit "stepmania-3.9_alpha20.ebuild")] stepmania-3.9_alpha20.ebuild ```  [Comment 27](#c27)  Sean Burke    2004-09-05 16:43:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 39014](attachment.cgi?id=39014 "stepmania-3.9_alpha20-gentoo.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=39014&action=edit "stepmania-3.9_alpha20-gentoo.patch")] stepmania-3.9_alpha20-gentoo.patch  Invalidated the wrong thing at the wrong time, but it doesn't matter. ```  [Comment 28](#c28)  Nebula    2004-09-05 16:56:56 UTC  ``` Re [comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=53958#c25), I don't think you need to mark it 3.9.0.22, but just 3.9_alpha22.  The current stable version of StepMania is 3.0, and I have a feeling this 3.9 series once it hits stable will become 4.0, not 3.9, since going from 3.0 -> 3.9 would be stupid.  These alphas are drastically different from 3.0, and it was my impression the 3.9-alphas would become 4.0-final in the end, not 3.9-final.  Kinda like how kernels use odd minor numbers to symbolize development kernels, etc...  Or if that doesn't make any sense, I think we should just stick to the versioning the devs are using, since adding that extra 0 in there might make things a little confusing.  Or maybe I'm just silly for wanting everything perfect.  And, as soon as your revised patch comes out, I'll be sure to help test.  I've got 2 DDR PS2 pads running through a USB convertor, and a bunch of eager friends. ```  [Comment 29](#c29)  Flammie Pirinen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-05 17:13:33 UTC  ``` Ah, so the _alpha-notation supports added numbers after all, then of course it should be _alpha22. Must've made some mistake last time I tested it so please disregard my last comment on that (I also kicked summary back in order).  I'm waiting for corrected _alpha22 eagerly as well, and sorry for extraneous spamming. ```  [Comment 30](#c30)  Warp Zero (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-05 18:33:51 UTC  ``` Hey Flammie and Nebula: Leave off.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

## Synopsis

Important: cups security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1123)

## Topic

Updated cups packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for Linux, UNIX, and similar
operating systems.

A string reference count bug was found in cupsd, causing premature freeing
of string objects. An attacker can submit a malicious print job that
exploits this flaw to dismantle ACLs protecting privileged operations,
allowing a replacement configuration file to be uploaded which in turn
allows the attacker to run arbitrary code in the CUPS server (CVE-2015-1158)

A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the cups web templating engine. An
attacker could use this flaw to bypass the default configuration settings
that bind the CUPS scheduler to the 'localhost' or loopback interface.
(CVE-2015-1159)

An integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in
the way cups handled compressed raster image files. An attacker could
create a specially-crafted image file, which when passed via the cups
Raster filter, could cause the cups filter to crash. (CVE-2014-9679)

Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2015-1158 and
CVE-2015-1159 issues.

All cups users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1221641#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-05-14 13:20:45 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in CUPS:  Cupsd uses reference-counted strings with global scope. When parsing a print job request, cupsd over-decrements the reference count for a string from the request. As a result, an attacker can prematurely free an arbitrary string of global scope. They can use this to dismantle ACLs protecting privileged operations, and upload a replacement configuration file, and subsequently run arbitrary code on a target machine.  This bug is exploitable in default configurations, and does not require any special permissions other than the basic ability to print.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1221641#c2)  Huzaifa S.

There is indeed a difference between how NVD rates things and how we rate things.  This is described on the Security Blog here:  <https://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/02/13/how-red-hat-uses-cvssv2-scoring-to-assist-in-rating-flaws/>  That should clarify things for you.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1221641#c15)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-06-30 04:23:09 UTC  ``` Change of CVSV2 scores again: ============================ Note: After more evaluation of the issues, it seemed like 6.8/AV:A/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C was a better scoring, the only change is AV:A. This is because cups servers are not commonly configured/available on the internet, therefore Availability = Adjacent Network (Intranet) seems to be more suitable in this case. Everything else remains the same.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1221641#c18)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-07-03 04:36:36 UTC  ```  In order to exploit this flaw you need:  1. Permissions to print on the cups-server. Cups server are usually internal to a network, so this is not something which is exploitable on the internet.  2. This flaw has to be combined with other flaw, [CVE-2015-1159](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-1159) in this case. We do not rate security flaws in combination of what damage can be done with other issues.  3. Lastly exploitation is difficult and it needs exact conditions to be matches several of them are detailed on the external reference linked on the bug, there are others as well.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1221641#c19)  Vincent Danen    2015-07-03 04:54:35 UTC  ``` In addition to what Huzaifa noted above, this flaw requires that CUPS be listening to a network interface connected to the internet for it to be exploited by the general public.  Typically, most CUPS installs listen to the localhost only (so the machine CUPS is running on) which is the shipped default.  In cases of running a print server, this would listen on an ethernet interface but even then, unless there is a reason for having someone on the other side of the world print to your printer, there are firewalls in place to prevent unknown entities from performing an attack, which leaves only attackers on your local network.  In addition, this flaw requires that the CUPS web interface is also listening on a network-reachable port (again, by default, only the localhost).  Note that just because you have CUPS listening for print requests on the local network it does not automatically mean that the web UI is available (this can be locked down to the localhost while still allowing for network printing).  As a result, this can be very easily mitigated even if you are using non-default configuration changes (which can only be made by a user with root privileges).  If you need to permit web-based configuration via the UI, you can easily lock it down to a particular administrator IP (using either CUPS itself or iptables).  See <http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.3/policies.html> for more details.   ``` |  |
