Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `getaddr_r` function within the glibc's NSS DNS resolver library. Specifically, the function enters an infinite loop when processing certain types of DNS responses, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This occurs when the function receives a positive answer during DNS resolution and attempts to process alias names that are not in the expected format (e.g. not in the form of IP address octets for reverse lookups).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The `getaddr_r` function contains a loop that fails to terminate under certain conditions, specifically when the input is an invalid or unexpected alias name. The loop is intended to check alias names in a specific format, but if an alias name like `ns5.dsredirections.com` is passed, the loop doesn't detect the invalid format and continues processing indefinitely.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation to identify invalid alias entries which don't follow the expected IP address octets format. It does not check for the presence of non-digit or non-hexadecimal characters in the input, resulting in the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. When the `getaddr_r` function gets stuck in the infinite loop, it consumes excessive CPU resources, preventing the affected service or application from functioning correctly. This can manifest as a 100% CPU utilization by the application using the DNS resolver, as reported by the initial reporter.
*   **Application Hang:** Applications that use the flawed DNS resolver functions can become unresponsive or hang as they wait for the resolver to return, which it never does, due to the infinite loop.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Response Manipulation:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a DNS response containing a PTR record with an alias name that causes the infinite loop (e.g., `ns5.dsredirections.com`).
*   **Malicious DNS Server:** A malicious DNS server under attacker control can be used to provide crafted responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DNS Spoofing or Control over DNS Server:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the DNS response received by the victim machine, either through DNS spoofing or by controlling a DNS server that the machine uses.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code Path:** The attacker needs to know that a specific name resolution can cause the vulnerable code path in getaddr_r to be invoked.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially identified in glibc version 2.11.3 and has been present since 2002.
*   A patch was developed to prevent the infinite loop by detecting entries with non-digit and non-hexadecimal digits and returning, preventing the infinite loop and the DOS impact.
*   The fix was applied to glibc 2.21.
