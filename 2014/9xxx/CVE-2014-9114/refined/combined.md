Use CVE-2014-9114.

It seems fairly clear that "blkid -o udev" is attempting to create
lines that are safe sh input. Or, more specifically, the expectation
is that the lines would be directly usable. We currently don't see a
reasonable alternative interpretation that blkid is simply attempting
to provide output lines that accurately reflect strings found on
device media, and is expecting that other components will make a
security determination about each line, before using that line as sh
input. Also, the blkid maintainer has apparently made other changes
relating to quoting of strings found on device media:

  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/commit/?id=1c9885cde853a458b5abe5ce0804abc27caf4fd4>

(we understand that it's not completely analogous). Finally,
<http://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/misc-utils/blkid.8>
says 'print key="value" pairs for easy import into the udev
environment' and those security determinations would probably not be
considered "easy import."

libblkid: care about unsafe chars in cache

```
The high-level libblkid API uses /run/blkid/blkid.tab cache to
store probing results. The cache format is

   <device NAME="value" ...>devname</device>

and unfortunately the cache code does not escape quotation marks:

   # mkfs.ext4 -L 'AAA"BBB'

   # cat /run/blkid/blkid.tab
   ...
   <device ... LABEL="AAA"BBB" ...>/dev/sdb1</device>

such string is later incorrectly parsed and blkid(8) returns
nonsenses. And for use-cases like

   # eval $(blkid -o export /dev/sdb1)

it's also insecure.

Note that mount, udevd and blkid -p are based on low-level libblkid
API, it bypass the cache and directly read data from the devices.

The current udevd upstream does not depend on blkid(8) output at all,
it's directly linked with the library and all unsafe chars are encoded by
\x<hex> notation.

   # mkfs.ext4 -L 'X"`/tmp/foo` "' /dev/sdb1
   # udevadm info --export-db | grep LABEL
   ...
   E: ID_FS_LABEL=X__/tmp/foo___
   E: ID_FS_LABEL_ENC=X\x22\x60\x2ftmp\x2ffoo\x60\x20\x22

I am going to work on SUSE:SLE-10-SP3:Update:Test.  Backporting process is not trivial, so please let me know, which other repositories are requested.   Several features are not present in SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update:Test, so many hunks don't apply there. I believe that I did not lost any. Other parts are significantly different.  There is one specific think, that seems to have a different way to exploit and needs a different fix.

Very old SLE versions (SLE10) don't have blkid at all, but they have mount by ID. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c14)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-09 14:36:19 UTC  ``` Should I backport fixes for SUSE:SLE-10-SP4:Update:Test and SUSE:SLE-11-SP2:Update:Test?   Regarding SLE10:  Hopefully, the code using blkid in SLE10 is dependent on external libblkid. And our packages are compiled without blkid support (at least in SLE10 SP3).  [   43s] You don't have blkid  Theere is only minor part of libblkid-like functionality without libblkid: mounting by name and UUID. As it is not exploitable by itself, I would stay away from backporting of parse_token() changes. These changes cannot be considered as fixes, they are just complementary changes to exploit-preventing save_quoted(). And these changes even cause minor change of behavior for volumes with " or \ in names. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c15)  Marcus Meissner   2015-01-09 15:58:33 UTC  ``` so i think there is no need for SLES10 backports at all?   I would say leave out the LTSS updates for now (so NO backports for SUSE:SLE-10-SP4:Update:Test and SUSE:SLE-11-SP2:Update:Test) ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c16)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-09 16:29:45 UTC  ``` I just finished my review of util-linux in SLE10 SP3.   Regarding unsafe characters in blkid:  As I say in [comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c14), I believe that the code is not exploitable, as there is no machine readable output.   Regarding buffer allocation overflow:  The fix from libblkid/src/partitions/gpt.c:get_gpt_header() has a valid backport to util-linux-2.12r/partx/gpt.c:alloc_read_gpt_entries(): [https://build.suse.de/package/view_file/home:sbrabec:branches:OBS_Maintained:util-linux-%62%73%63907434/util-linux.SUSE_SLE-10-SP3_Update_Test/util-linux-libblkid-overflow.patch?expand=1](https://build.suse.de/package/view_file/home%3Asbrabec%3Abranches%3AOBS_Maintained%3Autil-linux-bsc907434/util-linux.SUSE_SLE-10-SP3_Update_Test/util-linux-libblkid-overflow.patch?expand=1)  I was trying to find the same exploit vector like libblkid/src/probe.c:blkid_probe_get_buffer()  The code is very different there. There is no similar call, all probers are handing needed buffers by itself. I believe that the code implementing that functionality is here: util-linux-2.12r/mount/mount_guess_fstype.c.  As far as I see, there is only one offset that can possibly overflow: offset = 2048 * (toc[i]->cdte_addr.lba + 16);  Hopefully, there cannot happen anything worse than passing bad offset to lseek() and reading random chunk from CD ROM.  I found no other backport-able fixes.   I just submitted the fix to IBS. It depends on you whether you want to release the fix as a security update. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c17)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-09 17:59:44 UTC  ``` Thinking about the upstream fix, I still see no way, how to safely parse blkid output in shell. According to the manual page, this should be done by -o export. But it is still dangerous:  PoC:  dd if=/dev/null of=test.img bs=1024 seek=65536 /sbin/mkfs.ext4 -L 'a uname' test.img  (/sbin/blkid -o export test.img ; echo 'echo "Label is $LABEL."') | sh  Expected output: Label is a uname.  Current output: Linux Label is . ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c18)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-09 19:28:42 UTC  ``` Please ignore my last comment. I tested it with an unfixed blkid. The fix escapes spaces, so everything is OK, and the string does not need quotes.  -o export is first supported in SLE11 SP3, and not supported in SLE11 SP1. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=907434#c19)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-01-09 20:35:23 UTC  ``` Submitted: SLE10-SP3: Created IBS request id 48058.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-27 06:04:55 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer reported a command injection flaw in blkid. This could possibly result in command execution with root privileges (for example, when running blkid on a malicious USB drive):  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/26/13>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-27 06:21:58 UTC  ```  Created util-linux tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1168490](show_bug.cgi?id=1168490 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9114 util-linux: command injection flaw in blkid [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-27 06:23:14 UTC  ``` Tested on Fedora, seems it will be affected. I am not aware of any patches.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c3)  Karel Zak    2014-11-27 09:23:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Murray McAllister from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c0)) > Sebastian Krahmer reported a command injection flaw in blkid. This could > possibly result in command execution with root privileges (for example, when > running blkid on a malicious USB drive): >  > <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/26/13>  This is not true, udev never ever call "blkid -o udev", it always call blkid command with -p to *avoid* blkid cache usage.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c4)  Karel Zak    2014-11-27 12:21:17 UTC  ``` And we don't use blkid binary in recent udevd at all, it's directly linked with  libblkid and it does not use cached results at all.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c5)  Karel Zak    2014-11-27 13:12:58 UTC  ``` Fixed in upstream tree, commit:  <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/89e90ae7b2826110ea28c1c0eb8e7c56c3907bdc>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-27 13:18:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Karel Zak from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c5)) > Fixed in upstream tree, commit: >  > <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/> > 89e90ae7b2826110ea28c1c0eb8e7c56c3907bdc  Hi Karel,  Thank you for the info and patch!   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c7)  Ján Rusnačko    2014-12-01 21:33:42 UTC  ``` RHEL 5 is not affected by this, as blkid does not have option to format output as key=value to be eval`d. Only permitted options are value, device and full.  RHEL 6 is affected. As Karel mentioned, udev calls with -p, so the only suspicious call I found is in dracut-functions:      138 get_fs_env() {     139     if [[ -x /lib/udev/vol_id ]]; then     140 	eval $(/lib/udev/vol_id --export $1)     141     elif find_binary blkid >/dev/null; then     142 	eval $(blkid -o udev $1)     143     else     144 	return 1     145     fi     146 }  To trigger this code, one has to call `dracut --hostonly`, which forces sequential scan of entries in /proc/mounts. The scan continues until it finds entry which corresponds to /. Each entry passes through get_fs_env(), so if any of the devices up to and including / in /proc/mounts contain filesystem with malicious label, running dracut with hostonly would result in execution of command in malicious label. Content in /proc/mounts is appended, so malicious USB should not be an issue.  RHEL 7 is affected, but I haven`t found any code which would eval the output from blkid -o udev.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c9)  Ján Rusnačko    2014-12-01 21:47:08 UTC  ``` References:  <https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/89e90ae7b2826110ea28c1c0eb8e7c56c3907bdc> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/26/13>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c11)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-04 06:24:13 UTC  ``` util-linux-2.24.2-2.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c12)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-15 04:33:45 UTC  ``` util-linux-2.25.2-2.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1168485#c15)  Ján Rusnačko    2015-10-19 12:39:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of util-linux as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. Because exploitability of this issue requires conditions unlikely to occur, this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

# util-linux: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201612-14**

A vulnerability was discovered in util-linux, which could
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/util-linux** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.26** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.26** |

### Background

util-linux is a suite of Linux programs including mount and umount,
programs used to mount and unmount filesystems.

### Description

A command injection flaw was discovered in util-linux’s “blkid”
utility. It uses caching files (/dev/.blkid.tab or /run/blkid/blkid.tab)
to store info about the UUID, LABEL etc. it finds on certain devices.
However, it does not strip ‘”’ character, so it can be confused to
build variable names containing shell metacharacters, which it would
usually encode inside the value.

### Impact

A local attacker could create a specially crafted partition label
containing arbitrary code which would get executed when the “blkid”
utility processes that value.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All util-linux users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/util-linux-2.26"

```
