Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in D-Link DCS-2103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure implementation of the `sddownload.cgi` script which allows for arbitrary file access via directory traversal and full path disclosure due to lack of proper input validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Directory Traversal (Arbitrary File Download):** The `sddownload.cgi` script allows an attacker to use `../` sequences in the `file` parameter to access files outside the intended directory.
2.  **Full Path Disclosure:**  By sending a request with `file=/` to `sddownload.cgi`, the script reveals the full path of the requested directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can download sensitive files from the device, including configuration files, user databases, and potentially system files like `/etc/passwd`.
2.  **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can gain information about the server's file system structure which can be useful for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are exploitable through HTTP requests by manipulating the `file` parameter of the `sddownload.cgi` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable D-Link DCS-2103 device.
*   The attacker would typically be on the same network as the camera or have access through an exposed port.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Directory Traversal Example:** `http://site/cgi-bin/sddownload.cgi?file=/../../etc/passwd`
*   **Full Path Disclosure Example:** `http://site/cgi-bin/sddownload.cgi?file=/`
*   **Vulnerable Version:** D-Link DCS-2103, Firmware 1.0.0 and potentially other versions.

The information provided in the content gives more details than the typical CVE description by providing the specific vulnerable endpoint (`sddownload.cgi`) and example attack strings demonstrating the directory traversal and full path disclosure vulnerabilities.
