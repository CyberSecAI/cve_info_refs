Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `recover.php` file of Pligg CMS. The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['id']` and `$_REQUEST['n']`) before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter is base64 decoded, but not properly sanitized before being used in the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerable code constructs a SQL query using user-controlled data ($username) without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Insecure Password Reset Mechanism:** The password reset mechanism is also vulnerable. Even though the `n` parameter is intended to prevent password reset abuse, the fact it is sanitized before being used in the query means that attackers can't easily manipulate the query and that if a user loses the password, the attack vector can be used to get a new password without the need to know the old one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Password Disclosure/Modification:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to gain access to any user account by changing the user's password. This is achieved by manipulating the SQL query to reset the password of a targeted user.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Once the attacker gains administrative access, they can access sensitive information from the database, such as database configuration (from `dbsettings.php`).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By leveraging the gained administrative access, an attacker can plant malicious code (e.g., a web shell) on the server, potentially leading to complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests to `recover.php` with a specially crafted `id` parameter that contains a base64 encoded SQL injection payload.
*   **Password Reset Functionality:** The vulnerability is exposed through the password reset feature of the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Pligg CMS instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with specific parameters.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL is needed to craft the injection payload.
*   **Exploit development:** The attacker needs the ability to use an exploit script or craft manual requests to inject SQL code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes commit diffs showing the vulnerability fix. The commits demonstrate that the `id` and `n` parameters were being sanitized but after the query was created, so a change was made to sanitize before.
*   The attacker, "BlackHawk," created a Python exploit script (`exploit.py`) for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability leverages a base64\_decode, which was intended to prevent magic quotes, but ultimately enables the SQL injection.

This analysis highlights a critical vulnerability in Pligg CMS, which could lead to significant damage to the affected systems.
