# Pligg 2.x SQLi / PWD disclosure / RCE

---

*From*: BlackHawk <hawkgotyou () gmail com>

```
Copy-paste from inside the exploit:

#########     1. SQLInjection / User password change        #########

Let's get some details, vuln it's pretty obvious , look at recover.php source:
File: recover.php
----------------------------------------------------------

29. $id=$_REQUEST['id'];
30. $n=$_REQUEST['n'];
31. $username=base64_decode($id);
32 $sql="SELECT * FROM `" . table_users . "` where `user_login` =
'".$username."' AND `last_reset_request` = FROM_UNIXTIME('".$n."') AND
user_level!='Spammer'";
[...]
61. $to = $user->user_email;
62. $subject = $main_smarty->get_config_vars("PLIGG_Visual_Name").'
'.$main_smarty->get_config_vars("PLIGG_PassEmail_Subject");
63.
64. $body = sprintf(
65. $main_smarty->get_config_vars("PLIGG_PassEmail_PassBody"),
66. $main_smarty->get_config_vars("PLIGG_Visual_Name"),
67. $my_base_url . $my_pligg_base . '/login.php',
68. $user->user_login,
69. $password
70. );
71.
72. $headers = 'From: ' .
$main_smarty->get_config_vars("PLIGG_PassEmail_From") . "\r\n";
73. $headers .= "Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n";
74.
75. if (!mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers))
76. {
77. $saltedPass = generateHash($password);
78. $db->query('UPDATE `' . table_users . "` SET `user_pass` =
'$saltedPass' WHERE `user_login` = '".$user->user_login."'");
79. $db->query('UPDATE `' . table_users . '` SET `last_reset_request`
= FROM_UNIXTIME('.time().') WHERE `user_login` =
"'.$user->user_login.'"');
80.
81. $current_user->Authenticate($user->user_login, $password);
[...]

----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the base64_decode there are no problems of magic_quotes or
whatever, but as an mail must be sent for the password to be reset,
you have to totally take control of the query so no sospicious
notifications will be sent.
To prevent sending clear data & quotes with the request, I'll not use
$n variable, resulting in a longer and less fancy SQLInj.

Now that we are admin we use our power to:
[+] get database data from dbsettings.php
[+] plant some code to upload a post-exploitation Weevely shell

Code it's very dirty but works
