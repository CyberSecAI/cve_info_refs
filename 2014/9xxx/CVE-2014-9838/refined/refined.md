Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2014-9838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "theoretical out of bound access" within the `magick/colormap-private.h` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds access. This implies that the code might try to access memory outside the allocated bounds of an array or buffer when handling color maps.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The description states that it is a "theoretical" out-of-bounds access. It doesn't specify the severity but out of bounds read/write can cause a crash or information leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific details of how to trigger the vulnerability are not given, but it involves processing an image that causes an out-of-bounds access in the color map handling logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to provide a specially crafted image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the out-of-bounds access in the `colormap-private.h` file. This suggests that the attacker might need to be able to submit an image to ImageMagick directly or indirectly via some service that uses ImageMagick to process images.

**Additional Notes:**
- The description is brief, and more information about specific conditions is not provided.
