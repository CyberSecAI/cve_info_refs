- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Duplicator plugin for WordPress allows any registered user to create and download backup files. This functionality is exposed through AJAX actions that do not properly check user permissions.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Any registered user, regardless of their role or capabilities, can trigger the creation of backups, which could contain sensitive data and potentially lead to further exploitation.
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference**: The plugin allows access to backup files through a predictable URL (`http://wordpress-url/wp-snapshots/%file_name_from_json%`), making it possible to access backup files if their name is known.
    - **Lack of access control**: The AJAX actions `duplicator_package_scan`, `duplicator_package_build`, `duplicator_package_delete`, and `duplicator_package_report` are all accessible to any registered user without proper permission checks.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could download database backups and website files without requiring any specific privileges beyond being a registered user, potentially leading to data breaches or further system compromise.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to register as a user on the WordPress site, and then use the following sequence:
    1. Send a request to `http://wordpress-url/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=duplicator_package_scan` to start a scan.
    2. Send a request to `http://wordpress-url/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=duplicator_package_build` to build the backup. This request returns a JSON with the filename.
    3. Access the backup using `http://wordpress-url/wp-snapshots/%file_name_from_json%`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be a registered user on the target WordPress site.
