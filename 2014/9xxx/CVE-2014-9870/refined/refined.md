{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The user writeable TLS register (TPIDRURW) was being cleared on context switches to prevent it from being used as a covert channel. However, some applications, like those coming to Windows RT, expect the thread environment block (TEB) to be present in TPIDRURW. This patch aims to preserve the TPIDRURW register per thread.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability arises from the need to handle the user-writable TPIDRURW register correctly during context switches and particularly during fork(). If the register is modified and fork() is called, there's a potential issue. The patch ensures that the TPIDRURW value is always read during the copy_thread operation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If not handled correctly, a user-writable TLS register could be misused, potentially allowing tasks to interfere with each other. The correct handling ensures that the user-writable TLS register is preserved correctly across context switches and fork operations. An incorrect handling could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or a covert channel.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector would be an application that modifies the TPIDRURW register and then calls `fork()`. Without proper handling the data from the register may not be copied to the new process. Furthermore, if not cleared, this could introduce a covert channel. This patch is not about fixing a vulnerability, it is about introducing a feature while ensuring no vulnerabilities are introduced.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to execute code that can modify the TPIDRURW register and then call fork(). This code would likely be running in user space."
