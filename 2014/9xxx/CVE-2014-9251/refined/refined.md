Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-9251:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak password hashing algorithm within the Zenoss application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Weak password hashing: The specific hashing algorithm used is not strong enough, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to a copy of the Zenoss database may be able to brute-force user passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the Zenoss system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves gaining access to the Zenoss database where the hashed passwords are stored.
- This could be achieved through various means such as a SQL injection, direct database access, or via other vulnerabilities that may lead to credential theft.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires access to the Zenoss database containing the user password hashes.
- They do not necessarily need to have direct access to the Zenoss application. They only need the data.
