Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in OpenVAS Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used in SQL queries, specifically the `timezone` parameter of the `modify_schedule` OMP command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A remote attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the vulnerable `timezone` parameter. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Specific Parameter:**  The attack vector involves the `timezone` parameter of the `modify_schedule` OMP command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the OpenVAS Manager.
*   **Authentication:** While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the attacker would require some form of access to the OpenVAS Manager to send the malicious command, likely requiring authentication.

**Summary of information:**

The vulnerability is a SQL injection within the openvas-manager application, specifically related to the timezone parameter. By crafting a malicious OMP command with a specially crafted timezone parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database backend. This could lead to data breaches or modification of the system.
