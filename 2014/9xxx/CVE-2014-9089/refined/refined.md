Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-9089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of the 'sort' and 'dir' parameters in `view_all_set.php` before they are used in SQL queries within `view_all_bug_page.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The 'sort' and 'dir' parameters are split into chunks using the ',' delimiter. The application only validates the first two values of the split parameters. By injecting a third value, it becomes possible to inject arbitrary SQL code into the ORDER BY clause of the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can inject SQL code allowing them to read sensitive data.
- **Data exfiltration:** With `INTO OUTFILE`, an attacker could write the query results into a file on the server.
- Depending on database server capabilities, it might be possible to use stacked queries for more extensive damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** By crafting a malicious URL with manipulated 'sort' and 'dir' parameters.
  - Example: `/view_all_set.php?sort=id,status,severity'&dir=ASC,ASC,ASC&type=2`
    - Vulnerable parameters are `sort` and `dir`.
    - The `type` parameter is not vulnerable.
- The vulnerable code resides within `core/filter_api.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable MantisBT instance.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in MantisBT versions up to 1.2.17.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.2.18, by ensuring that only the first two elements from the exploded sort and direction parameters are used, and the rest are discarded.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Edwin Gozeling of ITsec Security Services, and the fix was developed by Victor Boctor, a MantisBT developer.
