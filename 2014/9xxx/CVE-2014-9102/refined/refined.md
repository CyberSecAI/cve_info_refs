The provided content from `www.kunena.org` directly relates to CVE-2014-9102. It describes the release of Kunena 3.0.6, which includes fixes for XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The release notes for Kunena 3.0.6 explicitly state that the update addresses both an XSS vulnerability and a SQL injection vulnerability. While the specific details of the vulnerabilities are not provided, the vulnerabilities were confirmed to be present in previous versions of Kunena.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An XSS vulnerability was present in prior versions of Kunena.
- SQL Injection: A SQL injection vulnerability was also present in prior versions of Kunena.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of these vulnerabilities is not detailed. However, based on the nature of XSS and SQL injection, the following impacts are possible:
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the forum, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- SQL Injection: An attacker could manipulate database queries to potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify information, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vectors are not provided in the content. However:
- XSS: It's likely that the XSS vulnerability could be triggered via user input, such as forum posts or profile fields.
- SQL injection: The SQL injection could be triggered through the manipulation of URL parameters or form data during database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the Kunena forum, either as a registered user or possibly even as an unauthenticated user, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
- The attacker would need some understanding of web application vulnerabilities, specifically XSS and SQL injection.
- For a successful XSS attack, the attacker would need a victim to access the maliciously crafted part of the application.
- For a successful SQL injection attack, the attacker would need to identify the vulnerable parameters or data entry fields that interact directly with the database.
