Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `wptexturize()` function in WordPress. This function is responsible for converting plain text characters into more visually appealing HTML entities (e.g., straight quotes to curly quotes).
*   The function uses a regular expression (`preg_split('/(<.*>|\[.*\])/Us'`) to split the input text into segments, distinguishing between HTML tags, shortcodes, and plain text.
*   A carefully crafted input string with a mix of angle brackets (`< >`) and square brackets (`[ ]`) can confuse the splitting process and lead to partial texturization of HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling**: The regular expression used for splitting the input is not robust enough to handle maliciously crafted text, allowing injection of attributes into HTML tags.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: By injecting attributes into HTML tags using the vulnerability, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into comments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (via admin access):**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within a comment on a blog post or page.
    *   When an administrator views the comment (e.g., in the moderation queue or Dashboard), the JavaScript executes.
    *   The injected script can perform actions with the administrator's privileges, such as modifying user passwords, creating new admin accounts, or editing plugins to inject PHP code.
    *   If PHP code is injected, it can be executed via another request, resulting in OS-level access on the server.
*   **XSS for regular users (if admin approves comment):** If an admin approves the comment containing the malicious script, any user who views the affected post or page will also execute the script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comments:** The primary attack vector is through the comment boxes on WordPress posts and pages, which are typically accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **HTML Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious code by manipulating HTML attributes such as the `style` attribute (e.g. to create a transparent tag covering the whole window and execute JavaScript using an `onmouseover` event handler)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to authenticate to leave a comment, making this an unauthenticated vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific way to craft an input string to bypass the `wptexturize()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions 3.0 to 3.9.2. It was fixed in WordPress version 4.0.1
* The vulnerability was discovered by Jouko Pynnonen.
* The `wptexturize()` function can be disabled as a temporary workaround but the official patch should be applied.
