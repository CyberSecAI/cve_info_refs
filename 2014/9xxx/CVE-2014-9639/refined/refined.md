Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `oggenc` tool of `vorbis-tools`.
*   The overflow occurs when processing the number of channels in an input WAV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The software does not properly validate the number of channels in the WAV file, leading to an integer overflow during memory allocation/access. This is in the `audio.c` file.
*  **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The integer overflow leads to out-of-bounds memory access in the `memcpy` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the `oggenc` tool. This is due to an out-of-bounds memory read due to the integer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WAV File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted WAV file as input to the `oggenc` tool. This WAV file has a number of channels that leads to the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted WAV file to the `oggenc` tool.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to execute the `oggenc` tool with the malicious file as input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during a fuzzing session.
*   The issue was reported to the xiph.org bug tracker on 2014-12-29, and publicly disclosed on 2015-01-18.
*   The vulnerability affects vorbis-tools 1.4.0 and potentially earlier versions.
*   A patch was created and distributed to address the vulnerability.
*  The fix for this vulnerability also addresses CVE-2014-9638.
* The vulnerable code is located in `audio.c`, specifically around lines 576-577, where `memcpy` is called after an integer overflow occurs.
