Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. SetDisplayText Heap Buffer Overflow**
    - **Root Cause:** The `SetDisplayText` method copies an attacker-provided string into a fixed-size heap buffer without proper bounds checking.
    - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution in the context of the browser.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file that triggers the vulnerable ActiveX control method.
    - **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker must be able to entice the target user to interact with the malicious content.

**2. StartRecord/StartRecordEx/StartScheduledRecord Heap Buffer Overflow**
    - **Root Cause:** The `StartRecord`, `StartRecordEx`, and `StartScheduledRecord` methods copy an attacker-provided string into a fixed-size heap buffer without proper bounds checking.
    - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution in the context of the browser.
    - **Attack Vector:** Visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file that triggers the vulnerable ActiveX control methods.
    - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to entice the target user to interact with the malicious content.

**3. SaveCurrentImageEx Stack Buffer Overflow**
    - **Root Cause:** The `SaveCurrentImageEx` method copies an attacker-provided filename into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
    - **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution in the context of the browser.
    - **Attack Vector:** Visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file that triggers the vulnerable ActiveX control method.
    - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to entice the target user to interact with the malicious content.

**4. SaveCurrentImage Stack Buffer Overflow**
