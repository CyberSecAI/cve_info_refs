Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element. Specifically, the affected applications (FactoryTalk View Studio and FactoryTalk Services Platform) load DLL files from an insecure location. This means that if a malicious DLL is placed in a directory that is searched by the application before the legitimate DLL, the malicious DLL will be loaded instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The applications are susceptible to DLL hijacking, where a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL is loaded by the application instead of the genuine one.
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The applications' search paths for DLL files are not adequately controlled, allowing for the loading of untrusted DLLs from user-writable locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain the same level of privileges as the application that loads the malicious DLL. This could lead to complete control over the affected system.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious DLL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack is local and requires the user to execute the vulnerable application.
*   **Malicious DLL Placement:** The attacker needs to place a crafted DLL in a location that will be searched by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine to place the malicious DLL and then convince a user to run the vulnerable application.
*   **Social Engineering:** Social engineering may be required to trick the user into accepting the malicious DLL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Ivan Sanchez of NullCode & Evilcode Team.
*   The advisory mentions that Rockwell Automation has released patches to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects FactoryTalk Services Platform and FactoryTalk View Studio.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 6.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating that while the attack is local, it can lead to complete compromise of the system with moderate complexity.
