  "additional_notes": "The content also mentions that the Secure flag is automatically set by Tomcat, when accessed through HTTPS or AJP. Therefore the upstream fix addresses only the HttpOnly flag and not the Secure flag.  The Debian bug report provides details about the issue with Tomcat and how the secure flag is set by default in Tomcat, but only if the connection is done via HTTPS connector, all cookies are secure thanks to the connector Secure option which is set by default. If Tomcat is accessed through the AJP13 connector, Apache transfers through the AJP protocol the information of whether the connection was through SSL or not and Tomcat uses it to set the Secure flag accordingly."
