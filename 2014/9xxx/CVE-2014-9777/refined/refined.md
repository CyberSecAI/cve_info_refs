{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm kernel driver, where improper validation could allow for an escalation of privileges and arbitrary code execution within the context of the kernel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of input parameters within the Qualcomm kernel driver.",
      "Insufficient checks on data passed to kernel functions."
