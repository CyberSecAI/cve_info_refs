The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in InfiniteWP Admin Panel, which manages multiple WordPress sites. The vulnerabilities include SQL injection, unrestricted file upload, and insecure password storage. This content provides more details than a typical CVE description.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection in `login.php`:**
    *   **Root cause:** Unescaped user-controlled `email` parameter in a SQL query. The `filterParameters()` function does not perform escaping as `$DBEscapeString` is set to false.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/escaping.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation or full system compromise.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending malicious SQL code through the `email` parameter in the login form.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker.

2.  **SQL Injection in `execute.php`:**
    *   **Root cause:**  Unescaped user-controlled `historyID` parameter in a SQL query. The `filterParameters()` function does not perform escaping as `$DBEscapeString` is set to false. `historyID` and `actionID` parameters should be escaped by `filterParameters()`.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/escaping.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation or full system compromise.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending malicious SQL code through the `historyID` parameter, and possibly `actionID`.
    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker.

3.  **Unrestricted File Upload in `uploadScript.php`:**
    *   **Root cause:** Unauthenticated users can upload various file types to the uploads directory, including .php files when the `allWPFiles` parameter is set. File names are suffixed with `.swp`.
    *   **Weakness:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability combined with misconfiguration leading to PHP code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server if two conditions are met: the uploads directory is writable by the webserver, and the webserver interprets `*.php.swp` files as PHP code. This can lead to full server compromise.
    *  **Attack vector:** Uploading a malicious PHP script by setting `allWPFiles` to true.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker, web server must be misconfigured to interpret `*.php.swp` as php.

4.  **Insecure Password Storage:**
    *   **Root cause:** Passwords stored as unsalted SHA1 hashes in `iwp_users.password`.
    *   **Weakness:** Use of weak and outdated hashing algorithm without salting.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to easily crack the passwords, maintaining access even after patching other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack vector:** Offline brute-force or dictionary attacks against the stored password hashes.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker with access to the database or a dump of the database.
