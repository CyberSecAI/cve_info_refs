Yes. And not only on case insensitive file systems, like with git, but
always :-(

I've attached a file to demonstrate it. It creates a repo with a
commit of a .git/hooks/pre-commit file. Git prevents writing this file
to the working tree, but dulwich happily writes it out.

/tmp % ./cve-2014-9390-create.py
/tmp % cd cve-2014-9390-repo.git
/tmp/cve-2014-9390-repo.git (git)-[master] % git reset --hard
error: Invalid path '.git/hooks/pre-commit'
HEAD is now at 1c27312 Evil commit
/tmp/cve-2014-9390-repo.git (git)-[master] % dulwich reset --hard
/tmp/cve-2014-9390-repo.git (git)-[master] % git commit -m "test" --allow-empty
You just got cracked! (not really but you could have been!)
[master 29a7100] test

For my own use cases of dulwich, I'm not affected by this as I only
ever read and write directly to repos with dulwich with out checking
out trees to a working tree.  Do other users actually use the dulwich
index module, or porcilian commands.

How do we fix this? I assume we start by filtering what we write in
dulwich.index.build_index_from_tree? Filtering the case sensitive and
case insensitive cases is easy, but some of the other edge cases
("git~1" on windows, ".g\u200cit" on HFS+) are a little more tricky.
Do we care about preventing a user from adding these paths to the
index?

No, the scope of CVE-2014-9390 does not include that. Use
CVE-2014-9706 for this vulnerability in dulwich.

The scope of CVE-2014-9390 is currently undefined, in part because
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9390>
intentionally doesn't have any related information. Usage of
CVE-2014-9390 is, very roughly, concerned with "The string .git/ for a
directory name has always been considered Very Special. Therefore,
other strings with equivalence relationships to .git/ must also be
considered Very Special."

The root cause of the problem in dulwich seems to be "The string .git/
for a directory name was not considered Very Special." This is
completely distinct conceptually, and is a much simpler case for CVE
coverage.

There are two types of concerns with CVE-2014-9390. First,
CVE-2014-9390 can only apply to omitted equivalence-relationship
handling in source code that is, or is directly copied from, "Git
before 1.8.5.6, 1.9.x before 1.9.5, 2.0.x before 2.0.5, 2.1.x before
2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1" source code. It is not possible to have
a CVE for a cross-implementation vulnerability class of this
equivalence-relationship handling. Second, usage of CVE-2014-9390
seems to span multiple types of problems, possibly including all of:

  <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/178.html>
  <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html>
  <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/182.html>

Package        : dulwich
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9706 CVE-2015-0838
Debian Bug     : 780958 780989

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dulwich, a Python
implementation of the file formats and protocols used by the Git version
control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-9706

    It was discovered that Dulwich allows writing to files under .git/
    when checking out working trees. This could lead to the execution of
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an
    application based on Dulwich.

CVE-2015-0838

    Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer
    overflow in the C implementation of the apply_delta() function,
    used when accessing Git objects in pack files. An attacker could
    take advantage of this flaw to cause the execution of arbitrary
    code with the privileges of the user running a Git server or client
    based on Dulwich.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.5-2+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.9.7-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dulwich packages.

Subject: Possible CVE Request: dulwich: does not prevent to write files in

Hi,

While looking at CVE-2014-9390 I noticed
<https://lists.launchpad.net/dulwich-users/msg00827.html> for dulwich reported by
Gary van der Merwe. Does the scope of CVE-2014-9390 also include these bits
from the above:

dulwich happily clones a repository which contains commit with invalid
paths, say .git/hooks/pre-commit, and thus allowing execution of code
on subsequent commits.

Upstream (Jelmer Vernooij) has fixed this with commit

Does this need a separate CVE from CVE-2014-9390?
