```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed within the application's context when other users interact with the affected pages. This can lead to the following: User session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST requests to the application's user interface"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the application's user interface or be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit vulnerability 3, while vulnerabilities 1 and 2 require authentication."
