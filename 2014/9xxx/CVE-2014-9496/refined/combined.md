| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14961#c0)  David Walser    2015-01-06 00:38:05 CET  ``` CVEs were requested for a divide-by-zero and buffer overread in libsndfile: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/12/24/3> <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/12/25/2>  The first request got no response.  A CVE was allocated for the buffer overread(s): <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/04/4>  I've added the upstream patches for both issues in Mageia 4 and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated libsndfile packages fix security vulnerabilities:  libsndfile contains multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in src/sd2.c because it fails to properly bounds-check user supplied input, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (CVE-2014-9496).  libsndfile contains a divide-by-zero error in src/file_io.c which may allow an attacker to cause a denial of service.

I don't know where you'd get an SD2 file though.  It sounds like it was an old format used on Macs in the past.  I did use sox to convert a WAV file to an aiff and that worked just fine (Mageia 4 i586). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14961#c2)  Herman Viaene    2015-01-08 12:08:48 CET  ``` MGA4-64 on HP Probook 6555b KDE.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-4430-1                   security () debian org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                        Yves-Alexis Perez
April 10, 2019                        <https://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : wpa
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9495 CVE-2019-9497 CVE-2019-9498 CVE-2019-9499
Debian Bug     : 926801

Mathy Vanhoef (NYUAD) and Eyal Ronen (Tel Aviv University & KU Leuven) found
multiple vulnerabilities in the WPA implementation found in wpa_supplication
(station) and hostapd (access point). These vulnerability are also collectively
known as "Dragonblood".

CVE-2019-9495

    Cache-based side-channel attack against the EAP-pwd implementation: an
    attacker able to run unprivileged code on the target machine (including for
    example javascript code in a browser on a smartphone) during the handshake
    could deduce enough information to discover the password in a dictionary
    attack.

CVE-2019-9497

    Reflection attack against EAP-pwd server implementation: a lack of
    validation of received scalar and elements value in the EAP-pwd-Commit
    messages could result in attacks that would be able to complete EAP-pwd
    authentication exchange without the attacker having to know the password.
    This does not result in the attacker being able to derive the session key,
    complete the following key exchange and access the network.

CVE-2019-9498

    EAP-pwd server missing commit validation for scalar/element: hostapd
    doesn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit message, so an
    attacker could use a specially crafted commit message to manipulate the
    exchange in order for hostapd to derive a session key from a limited set of
    possible values. This could result in an attacker being able to complete
    authentication and gain access to the network.

CVE-2019-9499

    EAP-pwd peer missing commit validation for scalar/element: wpa_supplicant
    doesn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit message, so an
    attacker could use a specially crafted commit message to manipulate the
    exchange in order for wpa_supplicant to derive a session key from a limited
    set of possible values. This could result in an attacker being able to
    complete authentication and operate as a rogue AP.

Note that the Dragonblood moniker also applies to CVE-2019-9494 and
CVE-2014-9496 which are vulnerabilities in the SAE protocol in WPA3. SAE is not
enabled in Debian stretch builds of wpa, which is thus not vulnerable by default.

Due to the complexity of the backporting process, the fix for these
vulnerabilities are partial. Users are advised to use strong passwords to
prevent dictionary attacks or use a 2.7-based version from stretch-backports
(version above 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-4).

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:2.4-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

For the detailed security status of wpa please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Description

[![@MegaManSec](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2505339?u=78aedab1262910f581b6fdfb2072e6d0248cb3b5&v=4&size=48)](/MegaManSec)[MegaManSec](https://github.com/MegaManSec)opened [on Dec 22, 2014](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/issues/93#issue-52691304)

Hi,

In sd2.c, 2 different buffer overruns may occur due to incorrent checking.

1:

1. cond\_at\_most: Checking rsrc.rsrc\_len > 12292 implies that rsrc.rsrc\_len has the value which may be up to 12292 on the false branch.

   442 if (rsrc.rsrc\_len > SIGNED\_SIZEOF (psf->header))
2. alias: Assigning: rsrc.rsrc\_data = psf->header. rsrc.rsrc\_data now points to byte 0 of psf->header (which consists of 12292 bytes).

   448 rsrc.rsrc\_data = psf->header ;
3. cond\_at\_most: Checking rsrc.map\_offset > rsrc.rsrc\_len implies that rsrc.map\_offset has the value which may be up to 12292 on the false branch.

   481 if (rsrc.map\_offset > rsrc.rsrc\_len)
4. cond\_at\_most: Checking rsrc.map\_offset + 28 >= rsrc.rsrc\_len implies that rsrc.map\_offset has the value which may be up to 12263 on the false branch.

   505 if (rsrc.map\_offset + 28 >= rsrc.rsrc\_len)

517

1. assignment: Assigning: rsrc.type\_offset = rsrc.map\_offset + 30. The value of rsrc.type\_offset may now be up to 12293.

   518 rsrc.type\_offset = rsrc.map\_offset + 30 ;
2. overrun-buffer-arg: Overrunning buffer pointed to by rsrc.rsrc\_data of 12292 bytes by passing it to a function which accesses it at byte offset 12293 using argument rsrc.type\_offset + k \* 8 (which evaluates to 12293). [show details]

   536 { marker = read\_rsrc\_marker (&rsrc, rsrc.type\_offset + k \* 8) ;

2:

Assigning: rsrc.rsrc\_data = calloc(1UL, rsrc.rsrc\_len).

443 { rsrc.rsrc\_data = calloc (1, rsrc.rsrc\_len) ;

1. symbolic\_assign: Tracking psf->headend since rsrc.rsrc\_len is tracked with rsrc.rsrc\_data.

   456 psf->headindex = psf->headend = rsrc.rsrc\_len ;

Overrunning dynamic array rsrc.rsrc\_data by passing it to a function that accesses it at byte rsrc.map\_offset + 28. [show details]

520 rsrc.type\_count = read\_rsrc\_short (&rsrc, rsrc.map\_offset + 28) + 1 ;

and:

Overrunning dynamic array rsrc.rsrc\_data by passing it to a function that accesses it at byte rsrc.map\_offset + 26. [show details]

511 rsrc.string\_offset = rsrc.map\_offset + read\_rsrc\_short (&rsrc, rsrc.map\_offset + 26) ;

Thanks,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

# USN-2832-1: libsndfile vulnerabilities

7 December 2015

libsndfile could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libsndfile](/security/cves?package=libsndfile) - Library for reading/writing audio files

## Details

It was discovered that libsndfile incorrectly handled memory when parsing

malformed files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libsndfile to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-9496](/security/CVE-2014-9496))

Joshua Rogers discovered that libsndfile incorrectly handled division when

parsing malformed files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libsndfile to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-9756](/security/CVE-2014-9756))

Marco Romano discovered that libsndfile incorrectly handled certain

malformed AIFF files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libsndfile to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7805](/security/CVE-2015-7805))
