The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Zoph <= 0.9.1, which are SQL Injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "id" and "action" variables on the `group.php`, `photos.php`, and `user.php` pages.
- XSS: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `photographer_id` and `album_id` parameters on the `edit_photos.php` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.
- Reflected XSS: Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript/HTML code into the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: Public defacement, confidential data leakage, and database server compromise.
- Reflected XSS: Execution of arbitrary HTML/script code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to client-side system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: Sending malicious GET requests to `group.php`, `photos.php`, and `user.php` pages, manipulating the `_action`, `location_id`, and `user_id` parameters with SQL injection payloads.
- Reflected XSS: Sending malicious GET requests to `edit_photos.php` with crafted `photographer_id` or `album_id` parameters containing JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Zoph application.
- For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be authenticated with the portal.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the GET parameters.
