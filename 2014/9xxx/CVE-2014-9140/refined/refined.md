{
  "CVE-2014-9140": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ppp_hdlc function in print-ppp.c in tcpdump 4.6.2 and earlier. This vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted PPP packet, potentially leading to a denial of service (crash) or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.",
    "affected_components": [
      "tcpdump"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking in the ppp_hdlc function when unescaping PPP packets. Specifically, the function does not ensure that there are enough bytes available in the input stream before attempting to read and process escaped bytes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (crash) due to the buffer overflow. In some scenarios, it might also be possible for an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the environment.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted PPP packet to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
