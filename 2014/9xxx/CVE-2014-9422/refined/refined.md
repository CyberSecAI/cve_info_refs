{
  "CVE-2014-9422": {
    "description": "The check_rpcsec_auth function in kadmin/server/kadm_rpc_svc.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass a kadmin/* authorization check and obtain administrative access by leveraging access to a two-component principal with an initial \"kadmind\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"ka/x\" principal.",
    "root_cause": "The validation function incorrectly uses strncmp() to compare the length-counted principal name components against null-terminated C strings for \"kadmin\", \"history\", and the default realm.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect validation of server principal names"
     
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who possesses the key of a specially named principal (such as 'kad/x') could impersonate any user to kadmind and perform administrative actions as that user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker with valid credentials."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must possess a valid key for a principal where the first component is a substring of 'kadmin' or whose realm is a left prefix of the default realm.",
     "additional_information": "kadmind can receive authentications to any server principal entry in the Kerberos database (excluding entries with either the DISALLOW_SVR or DISALLOW_ALL_TIX flags set). If the database contains an erroneously matching principal entry such as \"ka/x\", and an attacker knows the key for that entry, the attacker can conduct an escalation of privilege attack by forging tickets from any client principal name to that server principal. By picking a client principal name with administrative privileges, the attacker could perform arbitrary administrative operations on the Kerberos database."
