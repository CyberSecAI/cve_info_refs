{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Revolution Slider and Showbiz Pro WordPress plugins have insufficient authentication checks on AJAX actions, particularly within the `revslider_admin.php` and `showbiz_admin.php` files. These plugins register AJAX actions without verifying if the user is logged in or has the necessary privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate authentication checks",
      "Direct access to administrative functions via AJAX calls",
      "Lack of nonce verification",
      "Unrestricted file uploads"
   ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform various administrative actions, including:\n\n*   Deleting, creating, and updating sliders.\n*   Importing and exporting sliders.\n*   Uploading arbitrary files, including malicious PHP shells.\n*   Full access to the WordPress database and complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated AJAX requests to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`",
	  "POST requests with `action` parameter set to `revslider_ajax_action` or `showbiz_ajax_action`",
	  "Utilizing the `update_plugin` action to upload a malicious ZIP file containing a PHP shell"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any specific privileges, the vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication"
  },
  "additional_notes": "The identified vulnerability in Revolution Slider was fixed in version 4.2 (released in February 2014), with version 4.6.5 being the latest secure version as of December 2014. However, many users remained vulnerable due to outdated plugin versions bundled with themes. The Showbiz Pro plugin also suffered from the same vulnerability, which was not fixed as of November 2014. \nThe exploit code provided targets both Revslider and Showbiz Pro, using the `update_plugin` action to upload a ZIP file containing a PHP shell. The attacker can then execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending requests to the uploaded shell.\n\nSeveral other themes and plugins were also vulnerable to similar wp-config.php download vulnerabilities"
