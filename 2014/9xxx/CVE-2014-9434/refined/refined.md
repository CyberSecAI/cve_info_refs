The provided content describes multiple SQL injection and a reflected XSS vulnerability in Absolut Engine v. 1.73 CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization in multiple PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to unsanitized parameters in the following files:
    - `managersection.php` via the `sectionID` parameter
    - `edituser.php` via the `userID` parameter
    - `admin.php` via the `username` parameter (Blind SQL Injection)
    - `managerrelated.php` via the `title` parameter
- **Reflected XSS:** `managerrelated.php` is also vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting via the `title` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, extract sensitive data, modify existing data, or even gain control over the database server.
- **Reflected XSS:**
   - An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed by the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters, an attacker can manipulate database queries.
- **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code and tricking a user into accessing it, an attacker can execute the script in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- For SQL injection, the attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax.
- For reflected XSS, the attacker must be able to convince the victim to click a malicious link.
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the admin panel for most of the vulnerabilties, though the `managerrelated.php` XSS and SQL injection do not specify that as a requirement.
