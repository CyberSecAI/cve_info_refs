Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `upgrade_unattended.php` script in MantisBT was vulnerable because it retrieved database connection settings (hostname, username, password, database name) from POST parameters instead of retrieving them from the MantisBT system configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Data Handling:** The script directly used user-supplied POST parameters for sensitive database connection details.
- **Database Credential Exposure:** This allowed an attacker to potentially control the database connection parameters, causing the script to connect to a database server under the attacker's control using the legitimate database credentials of the MantisBT installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Credential Leakage:** An attacker could cause MantisBT to connect to a malicious server under their control and potentially capture the legitimate database credentials, including the database username and password of the MantisBT system, from the network traffic or logs of the malicious server.
- **Potential Data Breach:** With access to the database credentials, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the MantisBT database, leading to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker could send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `upgrade_unattended.php` script with a malicious hostname and capture the leaked credentials when the MantisBT server tries to connect to the attacker-controlled host.
- **Direct Access:** The `upgrade_unattended.php` script is located in the /admin/ directory which is intended to be removed after the installation. If this directory is accessible the exploit can be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the MantisBT server.
- **Targeted System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence and location of the `upgrade_unattended.php` script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program.
- The fix involves retrieving database connection settings from the Mantis system configuration instead of accepting them from POST parameters.
- The issue was fixed in MantisBT version 1.2.18.
- As part of installation instructions, the `/admin` directory (which contains the vulnerable script) should be deleted on a Production Instance.
- The `upgrade_unattended.php` script is intended for unattended upgrade of MantisBT installations and should not be publicly accessible.

The commit messages also confirm that the vulnerability was due to the script retrieving credentials from POST parameters, and the fix involves retrieving them from the system configuration.

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2014-9279 and provides more details than the standard CVE description.
