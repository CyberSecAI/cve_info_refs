Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The read/write lock implementation in Xen is biased towards read operations. This allows a continuous stream of read requests to indefinitely prevent write operations from acquiring the lock, leading to starvation. Certain read/write locks are vulnerable to pressure from guest VMs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Read-biased locking:** The core issue lies in the unfairness of the read/write lock implementation, where read operations are prioritized over write operations.
- **Guest-controlled pressure:** Guests can generate arbitrary read pressure on specific read/write locks, thus triggering the starvation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest administrator can cause a DoS for other tasks running on the host by starving them of required resources, specifically the affected lock.
- **Host Crash:** If the NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) watchdog is active, a timeout can occur due to the starvation, leading to a host crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious guest:** A compromised or malicious guest VM can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary read pressure:** The attacker achieves this by generating a continuous stream of read operations on a specific lock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest administrator privileges:** The attacker must be in control of a guest VM.
- **Ability to generate read requests:** The attacker needs to be able to induce read operations on the vulnerable lock, causing starvation.
- **X86 System:** The vulnerability is only exploitable on x86 systems. ARM systems are not vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- CVE-2014-9065 refers to the cases fixed with the provided patches, while CVE-2014-9066 refers to cases not fixed by the patch and will require more substantial changes planned for Xen 4.6.
- The vulnerability affects Xen 4.2 and later.
- There was no mitigation available other than patching.
- The advisory mentions that large guests (more than 30-40 VCPUs) might still be able to trigger intermittent problems even after applying the patch.
