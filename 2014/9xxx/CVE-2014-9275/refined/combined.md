## [bug-unrtf] out-of-bounds memory access in unrtf

```
Looks like this package is no longer maintained, but reporting just
for posterity: there seems to be a bug that probably makes it
dangerous to convert untrusted RTFs:

$ echo '{\cb-999999999' >x
$ unrtf x

This leads to segv while accessing a pointer that is essentially
within attacker's control.

These crashes are fixed by the following changes:

<https://bitbucket.org/medoc/unrtf-int/commits/1df886f2e65f7c512a6217588ae8d94d4bcbc63d>

and

<https://bitbucket.org/medoc/unrtf-int/commits/3c7ff3f888de0f0d957fe67b6bd4bec9c0d475f3>

I hope that Dave Davey will be able to apply them to the official version.

Cheers,

Jean-FranÃ§ois Dockes

## Updated unrtf package fixes security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 19 Dec 2014

Modification date: 19 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-9274](CVE-2014-9274.html)
,
[CVE-2014-9275](CVE-2014-9275.html)

## Description

```
Updated unrtf package fixes security vulnerabilities:

Michal Zalewski reported an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in
unrtf.  Processing a malformed RTF file could lead to a segfault while
accessing a pointer that may be under the attacker's control.  This would
lead to a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, the
execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2014-9274).

Hanno Böck also reported a number of other crashes in unrtf (CVE-2014-9275).

Use CVE-2014-9274 for the unrtf issue found by Michal Zalewski:

<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-unrtf/2014-11/msg00001.html>

Use CVE-2014-9275 for the "additional crashes" as demonstrated by

This is fixed by this change:
<https://bitbucket.org/medoc/unrtf-int/commits/b0cef89a170a66bc48f8dd288ce562ea8ca91f7a>

Hopefully Dave Davey who is the current maintainer, as far as I know, will
apply it.

Cheers,

Package        : unrtf
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9274 CVE-2014-9275
Debian Bug     : 772811

Michal Zalewski and Hanno Boeck discovered several vulnerabilities in
unrtf, a RTF to other formats converter, leading to a denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.21.5-3~deb7u1. This update is based on a new upstream version
of unrtf including additional bug fixes, new features and incompatible
changes (especially PostScript support is dropped).

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.21.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your unrtf packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Mark Kamichoff    2004-06-06 12:23:17 UTC  ``` After upgrading to glibc 2.3.3_pre20040529, I noticed the resolver prefers A records instead of AAAA records, if a hostname has both.  The application (wget, telnet, ssh, etc.) will resolve both addresses, but pick the IPv4 one by default.  From what I understand, this is an incorrect behavior.  Libraries and applications that are IPv6-aware should try the IPv6 address first, and if that fails, then fall back to IPv4.  I believe this is stated in an RFC, too.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use wget/ssh/telnet/etc. to connect to a hostname that has both A and AAAA records 2. Notice that the IPv4 address is chosen before the IPv6 one.  Actual Results:   The IPv4 address was chosen, instead of the IPv6 one.  Expected Results:   The IPv6 address should have been tried first.  If that failed, it should fall back to the IPv4 one.

At present, IPv6 is still experimental (=not widely working), IPv4 is still "the snatdard".  Why "applications" choose IPv4 by default? Because it is more stable. Most of them have otions (usually -6) to make them prefer IPv6.  IMHO, which is preferred should be a system setting (like somewhere in /proc), changeble on the fly, but at the moment it is not. Aiting for broken IPv6 implementations to time out is simply no good though.  If I was writing a network application (for the moment) -4 -6 and --prefer-IPv6 --prefer-IPv4 whould have been a standard set of options (-4 -6 meaning use *only*).  There was a similar discussion wheather gethostbyname() should sort (or randomize) the list of names on return. IMHO it is up to the application to choose wheather to use the firs in the list (simple logic), some random one (daubtfully better) or a few (all) in parallel (=waste of resources). Every approach is app-specific and glibc cannot know what is required.  I suggest wonfix for this one, unless somebody comes with a working patch to change that at runtime as system config.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-06-17 15:08:23 UTC  ``` You might try to change in /etc/nsswitch.conf:  -- hosts:       files dns6 dns --  not 100% sure if its supported though by glibc ...  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  pasi.valminen    2004-06-17 23:44:38 UTC  ``` Why would you spend time waiting for broken IPv6 implementations if you don't have IPv6 support in kernel? On the other hand why would you build IPv6 into your kernel unless you want to use it, test it or do developement? BUT you can't drop IPv4 from linux kernel, so you end up timeouting when connecting on dual stack hosts if they don't serve on IPv4. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-11-23 22:21:25 UTC  ``` this seems to be covered here: <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=524> <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=84> ``` |  |
