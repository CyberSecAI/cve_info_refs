{
  "CVE-2014-9583": {
    "root_cause": "The infosvr service on ASUS routers has an unauthenticated command execution vulnerability due to the use of `memcpy` instead of `memcmp` when verifying the MAC address, combined with a lack of password verification and an easily exploitable command execution function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass due to flawed MAC address check using memcpy instead of memcmp.",
      "Missing password verification, which could have provided a second layer of protection.",
      "Unrestricted command execution with root privileges via a crafted UDP packet containing an attacker-controlled command."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker on the LAN to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected ASUS router. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, potentially allowing for network manipulation, data theft, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor on the local network sends a specially crafted UDP packet to the vulnerable infosvr service listening on port 9999. The packet bypasses authentication and executes a command specified by the attacker.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable ASUS router. No prior authentication is required.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in the `processPacket` function of the `infosvr` service. Specifically, the MAC address check uses `memcpy` which always returns 0 if the arguments are valid pointer, which leads to bypass. The service does not check the password field, although a hardcoded check was found commented in the source code. The `NET_CMD_ID_MANU_CMD` opcode triggers the execution of arbitrary commands as root. The provided exploit code allows an attacker to send arbitrary commands which then get executed by calling the `system` command. The fix involves checking a certain nvram variable prior to command execution. There is also a workaround involving firewalling off port 9999 and killing the process after each boot."
