Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-9852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in `distribute-cache.c` of ImageMagick, where objects are used after they have been freed/destroyed. This is a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is the incorrect re-usage of objects after their destruction. This leads to the program accessing invalid memory locations, which may lead to crashes or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is an application crash, resulting in a denial of service. The attacker can cause the ImageMagick application to terminate unexpectedly by triggering the use-after-free condition.
*   **Unspecified impact:** The Mitre description also notes "unspecified impact via unspecified vectors" however there was not any detail to support further impact. The SUSE description only notes a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attackers:** The vulnerability can be triggered by remote attackers, suggesting that malicious input files could be crafted to exploit the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply input:** Attackers need to be able to supply a specially crafted input (image) that triggers the flawed logic in `distribute-cache.c`. The specific image format is not specified, and the exploit may be applicable to various formats.
*   **No authentication required:** No authentication is needed, meaning that the vulnerable process, when processing the malicious image, will be triggered.

**Summary of information from different sources:**
* The SUSE security advisory and the Red Hat Bugzilla entry mention the vulnerability and its impact as a denial of service.
* The oss-security mailing list provides detailed analysis of the vulnerability including a pointer to the upstream patch.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as having "moderate" severity by SUSE, which indicates a considerable risk but not the highest. The NVD rates the CVSS base score as 7.5 and CVSS vector as AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which indicates a high impact vulnerability.
*   The availability of upstream patches indicates a known fix for the use-after-free issue, but that the vulnerability was widely spread across multiple OS vendors.

**In short, CVE-2014-9852 describes a use-after-free vulnerability in ImageMagick that can be triggered remotely, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.**
