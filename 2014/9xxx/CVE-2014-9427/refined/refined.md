{
  "CVE-2014-9427": {
    "Description": "sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP before 5.5.21, when mmap is used to read a .php file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of file mapping length during processing of invalid PHP files in CGI mode.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory or execute arbitrary code if a valid PHP script resides in adjacent memory locations. A denial of service (crash) is also possible.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Uploading a crafted .php file",
      "Accessing a crafted .php file via a URL when PHP is used in CGI mode"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to upload a .php file or trigger the execution of a .php file when PHP is used in CGI mode. This can be done remotely.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "The vulnerability occurs when processing an invalid PHP file (starting with #) that lacks a newline character and mmap is used to read the file. The code that calculates the file mapping's length can cause an out-of-bounds read due to a missing length check. An attacker with the ability to upload php scripts can trigger this vulnerability"
