If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c12)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-15 03:25:36 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-27.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c16)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-04-09 06:52:54 UTC  ``` The vulnerable code is a part of the NTP autokey protocol. The client sends a public RSA key to the server, which encrypts a 32 bit secret and sends it back to the client. The client then decrypts it and stores it in a 32 bit integer temp32, However, the decrypted cleartext can be up to (keysize/8)-42 in size (e.g. 214 bytes for a 2048 bit key), which can result in a stack based buffer overflow.  There are two factors which cause this issue to have low security impact:  1. "autokey" needs to be explicitly enabled by generated a key using "ntp-keygen" utility and adding the following to the config file:  crypto pw serverpassword keysdir /etc/ntp  A mitigation is to disable autokey protocol, until this vulnerability is patched.  2. By default, the version of "ntp-keygen" utility shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux generate 512-bit RSA keys. Depending on the arch, this may overwrite upto 18 bytes on the stack and does not seem to cause any significant security impact.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c17)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-04-09 06:54:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  A mitigation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is available at: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c16](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c16 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9297 CVE-2014-9750 ntp: vallen in extension fields are not validated")   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 07:00:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1459 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1459.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2015-10-15 20:16:16 UTC  ``` The [CVE-2014-9297](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9297) (and [CVE-2014-9298](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9298)) was rejected, apparently because of an incorrect use on some unspecified place, where ids were ids were probably swapped.  [CVE-2014-9750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9750) is now expected to be used for the issue the [CVE-2014-9297](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9297) previously referred to.  This bug report was previously updated to replace rejected CVE id with the new one.  However, as the rejected id was already used in a released RHSA and is still the only id listed on the upstream security pages, I'm re-adding the rejected id here.  Released RHSA erratum was updated to also list the new CVE id as fixed.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-11-19 08:37:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:2231 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2231.html>   ``` |  |

Sidhpurwala    2015-04-09 06:52:54 UTC  ``` The vulnerable code is a part of the NTP autokey protocol. The client sends a public RSA key to the server, which encrypts a 32 bit secret and sends it back to the client. The client then decrypts it and stores it in a 32 bit integer temp32, However, the decrypted cleartext can be up to (keysize/8)-42 in size (e.g. 214 bytes for a 2048 bit key), which can result in a stack based buffer overflow.  There are two factors which cause this issue to have low security impact:  1. "autokey" needs to be explicitly enabled by generated a key using "ntp-keygen" utility and adding the following to the config file:  crypto pw serverpassword keysdir /etc/ntp  A mitigation is to disable autokey protocol, until this vulnerability is patched.  2. By default, the version of "ntp-keygen" utility shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux generate 512-bit RSA keys. Depending on the arch, this may overwrite upto 18 bytes on the stack and does not seem to cause any significant security impact.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1184573#c17)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-04-09 06:54:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

## NTP Project Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) contains multiple vulnerabilities (Updated)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#852879

Original Release Date: 2014-12-19 | Last Revised: 2015-10-27

---

### Overview

The NTP Project ntpd version 4.2.7 and pervious versions contain several vulnerabilities. ntp-keygen prior to version 4.2.7p230 also uses a non-cryptographic random number generator when generating symmetric keys. These vulnerabilities may affect ntpd acting as a server or client.

### Description

| The Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides networked systems and devices with a way to synchronize time for various services and applications. The reference implementation produced by the NTP Project (ntp.org) contains several vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html): **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2014-9298The IPv6 address ::1 can be spoofed, allowing an attacker to bypass ACLs based on ::1.[**CWE-754**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html)**: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions -** CVE-2014-9297The length value in extension field pointers is not properly validated, allowing information leaks.[**CWE-332**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/332.html)**: Insufficient Entropy in PRNG -** CVE-2014-9293If no authentication key is defined in the ntp.conf file, a cryptographically-weak default key is generated.[**CWE-338**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)**: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) -** CVE-2014-9294ntp-keygen before 4.2.7p230 uses a non-cryptographic random number generator with a weak seed to generate symmetric keys.[**CWE-121**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)**: Stack Buffer Overflow -** CVE-2014-9295A remote unauthenticated attacker may craft special packets that trigger buffer overflows in the ntpd functions crypto\_recv() (when using autokey authentication), ctl\_putdata(), and configure(). The resulting buffer overflows may be exploited to allow arbitrary malicious code to be executed with the privilege of the ntpd process.[**CWE-389**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/389.html)**: Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes -** CVE-2014-9296A section of code in ntpd handling a rare error is missing a return statement, therefore processing did not stop when the error was encountered. This situation may be exploitable by an attacker.The NTP Project provides more information about these issues in their [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice).The NTP Project implementation is widely used in operating system distributions and network products. These vulnerabilities affect ntpd acting as a server or client. CERT/CC is not aware of any public exploit of these vulnerabilities at this time.The CVSS score below is based on the buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-9295). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ntpd may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary malicious code with the privilege level of the ntpd process. The weak default key and non-cryptographic random number generator in ntp-keygen may allow an attacker to gain information regarding the integrity checking and authentication encryption schemes. More specifically, the weak default key allows access to private mode and control mode queries that require authentication, if not restricted by the configuration. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues have been addressed in ntp-4.2.8p1. The update may be downloaded from [ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Restrict status queries**As noted in the [announcement](http://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2014-December/000122.html) for ntp-4.2.8:The vulnerabilities listed below can be significantly mitigated by following the BCP of putting restrict default ... [noquery](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions#Section_6.5.2)in the ntp.conf file.  With the exception of:   receive(): missing return on error   References: Sec 2670 / CVE-2014-9296 / VU#852879below (which is a limited-risk vulnerability), none of the recent vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited if the source IP is restricted from sending a 'query'-class packet by your ntp.conf file.**Use firewall rules**Install firewall rules that block ::1 IPv6 address from inappropriate network interfaces.**Disable autokey authentication**Disable Autokey Authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the crypto keyword in your ntp.conf file. |

Affected

### Vendor Statement

"Our XTM and Firebox appliances (our main products) are not vulnerable to these flaws, since we use openntpd rather than ntpd.

Our wireless access points are not vulnerable since they only use the basic ntpclient.

However, our XCS appliances (mail security) are vulnerable to the ntpd flaws. We will be releasing a firmware update to fix these flaws as soon as practical. However, in the meantime, we are sharing simple steps to mitigate this issue (use out firewall to block NTP, and point to an internal, updated NTP server instead)."

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with another referenced time source.

It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source IP
address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send malicious
control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses.
(CVE-2014-9298)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP hosts that were peering
with each other authenticated themselves before updating their internal
state variables. An attacker could send packets to one peer host, which
could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization process among
the reached peers. (CVE-2015-1799)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5 symmetric
keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to
guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to spoof an NTP client
or server. (CVE-2015-3405)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey protocol
was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret received from an NTP
server, it could cause that client to crash. (CVE-2014-9297)

It was found that ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured to use
symmetric cryptographic keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this
flaw to send crafted packets that would be accepted by a client or a peer
without the attacker knowing the symmetric key. (CVE-2015-1798)

The CVE-2015-1798 and CVE-2015-1799 issues were discovered by Miroslav
Lichvár of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* The ntpd daemon truncated symmetric keys specified in the key file to 20

bytes. As a consequence, it was impossible to configure NTP authentication
to work with peers that use longer keys. The maximum length of keys has now
been changed to 32 bytes. (BZ#1053551)

* The ntp-keygen utility used the exponent of 3 when generating RSA keys,

and generating RSA keys failed when FIPS mode was enabled. ntp-keygen has
been modified to use the exponent of 65537, and generating keys in FIPS
mode now works as expected. (BZ#1184421)

* The ntpd daemon included a root delay when calculating its root

dispersion. Consequently, the NTP server reported larger root dispersion
than it should have and clients could reject the source when its distance
reached the maximum synchronization distance (1.5 seconds by default).
Calculation of root dispersion has been fixed, the root dispersion is now
reported correctly, and clients no longer reject the server due to a large
synchronization distance. (BZ#1045376)

* The ntpd daemon dropped incoming NTP packets if their source port was

lower than 123 (the NTP port). Clients behind Network Address Translation
(NAT) were unable to synchronize with the server if their source port was
translated to ports below 123. With this update, ntpd no longer checks the
source port number. (BZ#1171630)

Enhancements:

* This update introduces configurable access of memory segments used for

Shared Memory Driver (SHM) reference clocks. Previously, only the first two
memory segments were created with owner-only access, allowing just two SHM
reference clocks to be used securely on a system. Now, the owner-only
access to SHM is configurable with the "mode" option, and it is therefore
possible to use more SHM reference clocks securely. (BZ#1122015)

* Support for nanosecond resolution has been added to the SHM reference

clock. Prior to this update, when a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) hardware
clock was used as a time source to synchronize the system clock (for
example, with the timemaster service from the linuxptp package), the
accuracy of the synchronization was limited due to the microsecond
resolution of the SHM protocol. The nanosecond extension in the SHM
protocol now enables sub-microsecond synchronization of the system clock.
(BZ#1117704)

## Solution

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing the update, the ntpd daemon will
restart automatically.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2014-11-03 00:40:13 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #2655](show_bug.cgi?id=2655 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple vulnerabilities in ntpd") +++  7) Missing validation of vallen leading to various info leaks * ntpd/ntp_crypto.c:571 * ntpd/ntp_crypto.c:1162 * ntpd/ntp_crypto.c:1559 * ntpd/ntp_crypto.c:2117 * ntpd/ntp_crypto.c:1461   fix: verify that the packet format is valid right after it was received ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-15 12:10:16 UTC  ``` In ntp-stable:  571 is in crypto_recv(), in the ASSOC|RESP clause, where we copy the peer->subject.  1162 is in crypto_xmit(), in the CERT|RESP clause, where we copy the certname.  1461 is in crypto_verify(), where we check the signature length.  1559 is in crypto_encrypt(), where we get the length of the public key.  2117 is in crypto_bob(), where we get the length of 'r' for the challenge.  In ntp-dev, these areas are:  575 (copying peer->subject)  1170 (copy the certname)  1461 (check the signature length)  1560 (length of the public key)  2122 (length of 'r') ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2014-12-31 11:32:10 UTC  ``` Note to Harlan: see line 1503 in the current ntp_crypto.c ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c3)  Harlan Stenn    2015-01-03 11:25:40 UTC  ``` Stephen,  I'll email you separately with the location of a tarball that has the patches described below.  The reported problem at line 571 is now at line 601, and I believe the check at line 529 handles this case.  Do you agree?  The CERT|RESP case that was at 1162 is now near line 1209, and I believe I have fixed that around line 1198.  The reported problem in crypto_verify() that was at 1461 in the old code is at (I believe) line 1561 in the current code.  I believe the check at line 1502 handles this case already.  Do you agree?  The reported problem in crypto_encrypt() that was at line 1559 in the original code is now at line 1599 in the new code.  I think I have this fixed with the new test at line 1350.  Do you agree?  The reported problem that was at line 2117 of crypto_bob() in the old code is now around line 2187 of the new code.  I think I have fixed this with the new test at line 2189.  Do you agree? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c4)  Stephen Röttger    2015-01-03 13:04:26 UTC  ``` > The reported problem at line 571 is now at line 601, and I believe the check at > line 529 handles this case.  Do you agree?  yes, looks good to me.  > The CERT|RESP case that was at 1162 is now near line 1209, and I believe I have > fixed that around line 1198.  looks good to me.  > The reported problem in crypto_verify() that was at 1461 in the old code is at > (I believe) line 1561 in the current code.  I believe the check at line 1502 > handles this case already.  Do you agree?  The code looks like this: 	i = (vallen + 3) / 4; 	siglen = ntohl(ep->pkt[i++]); 	if (len < VALUE_LEN + ((vallen + 3) / 4) * 4 + ((siglen + 3) / 	    4) * 4) 		return (XEVNT_LEN); "i" is calculated from vallen and used as a read index to ep->pkt. Are there any checks that I'm missing? Also, the calculations in the check afterwards can overflow, for example if vallen is UINT32_MAX-3, the result will be 0 and pass the check.  > The reported problem in crypto_encrypt() that was at line 1559 in the original > code is now at line 1599 in the new code.  I think I have this fixed with the new test at line 1350.  Do you agree?  looks good to me  > The reported problem that was at line 2117 of crypto_bob() in the old code is > now around line 2187 of the new code.  I think I have fixed this with the new > test at line 2189.  Do you agree?  looks good to me  What about crypto_bob2? That one looks similar to crypto_bob. I think it would be the better approach to verify the packet format once in the beginning instead of doing it every time a value is used. This way it's easy to miss something and it makes it very tough to verify. Is there a reason you decided against that approach? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2015-01-07 07:21:44 UTC  ``` Stephen,  I put in an "early" check anyway, and I've asked some folks to test this to make sure it hasn't broken anything.  I've made a number of additional changes to the codebase, which I suspect you've now seen. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c6)  Martin Burnicki    2015-01-09 11:21:49 UTC  ``` I'm one of the folks who ran a quick test on this. ;-)  I've set up a server and a client, both running 4.2.8p1-beta5, configured autokey, and verified that the client synchronizes to the server.  Then I replaced first the client only, then the server only, and finally both binaries with the v4.2.8p1-[bug2671](show_bug.cgi?id=2671 "VERIFIED FIXED - vallen is not validated, leading to potential info leak")-RC1 from Harlan's private directory, and I can confirm that each combination still works, at least with the IFF keys. Haven't looked at the patches, yet, so I can't tell if the key type matters. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c7)  Harlan Stenn    2015-02-04 08:31:07 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.2.8p1. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2671#c8)  JGhosh    2015-10-28 10:25:56 UTC  ``` Hi Harlan,  Myself JGhosh, an opensource developer, working on NTP cherry pick integration from specific [Bug 2671](show_bug.cgi?id=2671 "VERIFIED FIXED - vallen is not validated, leading to potential info leak") into a FreeBSD private repo.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
