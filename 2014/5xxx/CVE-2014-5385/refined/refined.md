The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Shopizer webshop versions 1.1.5 and below.

**1. Remote Command Execution:**
*   **Root Cause:** The application uses an outdated version of Apache Struts (2.2.1.1 or 2.1.6), which is vulnerable to Remote Command Execution via OGNL injection.
*   **Vulnerability:** OGNL injection in multiple parameters like "productId" and "search".
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Java code execution, leading to full system compromise.
*  **Attack Vector:** By sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/shop/product/reviews.action` or `/shop/search.action` endpoints.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can achieve Remote Command Execution by exploiting the outdated Struts version and injecting malicious OGNL expressions.

**2. Manipulation of Product Prices:**
*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input validation allows for negative values in product quantities during checkout.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the product quantity parameter, allowing negative values.
*   **Impact:** Attacker can manipulate the total cost of products by specifying negative quantities, effectively purchasing goods at significantly reduced prices or even for free.
*   **Attack Vector:** By intercepting and modifying the AJAX DWR request or by issuing specially crafted requests to the `/shop/cart/addToCart` endpoint.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can modify the quantities in the shopping cart by intercepting the AJAX requests and issuing crafted requests through the browser.

**3. Manipulation of Customer Data / Mass Assignment:**
*   **Root Cause:** The application uses the `customerId` parameter to identify customers in several actions, which can be modified by an attacker to target other customers. Additionally, the `customer.customerPassword` parameter can be appended to user detail modification requests to change passwords.
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper input validation and authorization, enabling attackers to modify contact details, and user passwords.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can modify personal information of other users, potentially gaining access to other user accounts and their order history. Also, attackers could change the password of other user accounts, taking over their accounts.
*   **Attack Vector:** By adding the `customer.customerId` parameter to the `/shop/profile/register.action` or `/shop/profile/changeAddress.action` request or appending the `customer.customerPassword` parameter when saving user details.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can register a new user or modify an existing userâ€™s details, including their password, by manipulating the `customerId` parameter in HTTP requests.

**4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in various actions within the web application, such as modifying product prices, and creating product reviews.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can change product prices, manipulate shop configurations, and overwrite customer passwords by tricking administrators into visiting malicious URLs.
*  **Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious URLs (e.g., within an `<img>` tag) and tricking authenticated administrators to access it.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into sending malicious requests by using specially crafted URLs.

**5. Missing Anti Brute Force Protection:**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of brute-force protection mechanism against login attempts
*   **Vulnerability:** No rate limiting or account lockout mechanism is implemented, making it easier for attackers to guess passwords
*   **Impact:** Attackers can brute-force user credentials, particularly given that the password policy is weak.
*   **Attack Vector:** By making repeated login attempts.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can repeatedly try different passwords for users due to the lack of brute-force protection and weak password policies.

**6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization of user-provided data in the administration interface.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Reflected XSS in multiple parameters like `customername` in `/central/orders/searchcriteria.action` and `productname`, `availability`, and `status` in `/central/catalog/productlist.action`.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of users, potentially stealing sensitive information like session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious URLs that inject JavaScript into the web page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the application by manipulating HTTP parameters and tricking users into visiting malicious URLs.
