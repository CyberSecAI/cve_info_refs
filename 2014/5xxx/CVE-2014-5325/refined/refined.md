Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5325:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an XML external entity injection flaw in Direct Web Remoting (DWR). Specifically, it occurs when processing XML data using the DOMConverter, JDOMConverter, DOM4JConverter, or XOMConverter classes in DWR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CWE-611):** The application processes XML input that can include references to external entities, which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can potentially read any file accessible to the web application server by injecting malicious XML that references external entities.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The confidentiality of system files can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Specially Crafted Request:**  The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious XML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious XML payload referencing external entities

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in DWR versions 2.0.10 and earlier and version 3.0.RC2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Takeshi Terada of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. to IPA.
- The CVSS base score is 5.8, indicating a medium severity.
- The access complexity is medium due to the need for crafting specific XML requests, not the exploit is complex itself
- The vulnerability is related to the use of functions in DWR that convert DOM data.
