Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-5466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Dashboard feature of Splunk Web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script that is stored and executed when other users access the affected dashboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can inject arbitrary script, potentially leading to malicious actions when other users view the dashboard. The injected script could be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the dashboard feature of Splunk Web. An attacker would inject malicious script into a dashboard, likely through a field or parameter that's not properly sanitized. When another user views the compromised dashboard, the stored script executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the dashboard to inject the malicious script. The specific mechanism of injection is not detailed. It is likely an attacker would need some level of authorized access to a dashboard or potentially to inject the payload via an API if the dashboard functionality is exposed.

**Affected Components:**
*   search heads
*   heavy forwarders with Splunk Web enabled
*   indexers with Splunk Web enabled

**Unaffected Components:**
*   universal forwarders

**Affected Versions:**
*   Splunk Enterprise 6.1.x before 6.1.4
*   Splunk Enterprise 6.0.x before 6.0.7
*   Splunk Enterprise 5.0.x before 5.0.10
