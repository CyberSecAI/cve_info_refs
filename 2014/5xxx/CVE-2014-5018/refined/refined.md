Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a double-quoting issue within the `frontend_helper.php` file. Specifically, the code was attempting to escape a string using `autoEscape` and then subsequently using `Yii::app()->db->quoteValue`, which also performs quoting. This double-quoting led to issues, particularly when resuming a survey with certain identifiers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Double SQL Quoting:** The primary weakness was the double application of escaping/quoting mechanisms on a string being used in an SQL query. This means that the string intended to be inserted into the database was unintentionally altered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is that the application might fail to correctly resume a survey due to an invalid identifier. The original bug report (http://bugs.limesurvey.org/view.php?id=9134) and the forum posts cited in the comments suggest that this double-quoting issue interferes with the normal functionality of the survey application, specifically the ability to resume a survey.
*   The comments also mention that this issue was causing problems since a recent update, with forum users reporting issues regarding the same. This indicates a disruption of service for users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the normal survey resume functionality, an unexpected string is sent. This doesn't appear to be a standard attack vector in terms of direct injection, but rather an unintended consequence of the double quoting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker is a user of the survey application, simply by attempting to resume a survey. They do not need any special privileges or position other than being a legitimate user of the system.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided commit fixes the issue by removing the custom escaping via the autoEscape function and using the `Yii::app()->db->quoteValue`, which properly handles the quoting required for database queries.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the system handles user input, specifically session data, when constructing SQL queries, leading to a failure in resuming the survey process due to the double quoting.

**Summary of Changes in the Commit:**
* **`application/helpers/common_helper.php`:**
   - Removed the `autoEscape` function that was performing the initial escaping operation.
*   **`application/helpers/frontend_helper.php`:**
    - Changed the way the identifier is added to the SQL query by using the Yii framework's `quoteValue` method for safer handling of strings in SQL queries, and removing the previous custom escaping done by the `autoEscape` function.
