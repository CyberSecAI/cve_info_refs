Seems there are a double quoting here ?

See: <http://bugs.limesurvey.org/view.php?id=9134> ?

Not sure it's this one, but have some forum post since last upate with same issue.

Fixed with Yii in [e86b028](https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey/commit/e86b028c9165a1f6048a3a0c79c542771cea8cd4) :)
