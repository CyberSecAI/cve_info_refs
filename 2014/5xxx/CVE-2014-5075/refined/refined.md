{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-5075",
  "description": "The SSLSocket in the Smack XMPP API did not perform hostname verification. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The Smack library's SSLSocket implementation does not perform hostname verification during TLS/SSL handshake.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing hostname verification in SSL/TLS connections."
      ],
      "impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker can intercept and redirect traffic between a client application and a legitimate XMPP server.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting the network traffic between the client and server."
      ],
       "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server. Additionally, the attacker needs to possess a valid SSL/TLS certificate for a domain under their control. "
    }
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Upgrade to Smack version 4.0.2 or later.",
    "Configure a proper HostnameVerifier using `connectionConfiguration.setHostnameVerifier()`."
   ],
  "productsAffected": [
    "Smack XMPP API versions 4.0.0 and 4.0.1",
    "Smack 2.x and 3.x when a custom SSLContext is provided",
    "Applications utilizing vulnerable versions of Smack"
  ],
  "additionalInformation": "Smack versions 2.2.0 to 3.4.1 used a custom ServerTrustManager that performed hostname verification but had issues with basicConstraints and nameConstraints of the certificate chain. This was removed in Smack 4.0.0, and applications using a custom TrustManager did not benefit from it, leaving them vulnerable unless they explicitly verify the hostname."
