| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1127276#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-08-06 14:07:38 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that Smack (XMPP client library) is vulnerable to MitM attacks with a crafted SSL certificates. Quote from [1]: ... Details -------  Smack is using Java's `SSLSocket`, which checks the peer certificate using an `X509TrustManager`, but does not perform hostname verification. Therefore, it is possible to redirect the traffic between a Smack-using application and a legitimate XMPP server through the attacker's server, merely by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control.  In Smack versions 2.2.0 to 3.4.1, a custom `ServerTrustManager` implementation was used, which was supplied with the connection's server name, and performed hostname verification. However, it failed to verify the basicConstraints and nameConstraints of the certificate chain ([CVE-2014-0363](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0363), <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0363>) and has been removed in Smack 4.0.0.  Applications using Smack 2.2.0 to 3.4.1 with a custom `TrustManager` did not benefit from `ServerTrustManager` and are vulnerable as well, unless their own `TrustManager` implementation explicitly performs hostname verification. ...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 08:21:09 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches  the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c1)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 09:16:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533>  This issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6; and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and JBoss Data Virtualization 6. A future update may address this issue.  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat JBoss Operations Network Product Update and Support Policy: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/>  Fuse ESB 4, Fuse Message Broker 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and Fuse Services Framework 2.3, 2.4 are now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that the JClouds scriptbuilder Statements class writes a temporary file to a predictable location. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive data, denial of service, or other attacks. (CVE-2014-4651)

It was found that SSLSocket in Smack did not perform hostname verification. An attacker could redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control. (CVE-2014-5075)

It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.

# CVE-2014-5075 MitM Vulnerability in the Smack XMPP Library for Java

*Georg Lukas, rt-solutions.de, 2014-08-05*

[Smack](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) is an Open Source XMPP (Jabber) client library for instant messaging and presence written in Java. Smack prior to version 4.0.2 is vulnerable to TLS Man-in-the-Middle attacks, as it fails to check if the server certificate matches the hostname of the connection.

## Affected versions

* Smack 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 are vulnerable.
* Smack 2.x and 3.x are vulnerable if a custom `SSLContext` is supplied via `connectionConfiguration.setCustomSSLContext()`.

## Details

Smack is using Java's `SSLSocket`, which checks the peer certificate using an `X509TrustManager`, but does not perform hostname verification. Therefore, it is possible to redirect the traffic between a Smack-using application and a legitimate XMPP server through the attacker's server, merely by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control.

In Smack versions 2.2.0 to 3.4.1, a custom `ServerTrustManager` implementation was used, which was supplied with the connection's server name, and performed hostname verification. However, it failed to verify the basicConstraints and nameConstraints of the certificate chain ([CVE-2014-0363](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0363)) and has been removed in Smack 4.0.0.

Applications using Smack 2.2.0 to 3.4.1 with a custom `TrustManager` did not benefit from `ServerTrustManager` and are vulnerable as well, unless their own `TrustManager` implementation explicitly performs hostname verification.

## Mitigation

Users of the Smack library are advised to upgrade to Smack 4.0.2, and then use `connectionConfiguration.setHostnameVerifier()` with a reasonable `HostnameVerifier` implementation. A proper hostname verifier **MUST** be configured to close the vulnerability.

For Smack 3.x users, a [backported commit](https://github.com/ge0rg/smack/commit/8d483b25bda7ae86a3f3e83217c2add6d710798a) has been created. Here, a `HostnameVerifier` implementation needs to be supplied via `connectionConfiguration.setHostnameVerifier()` as well.

When using the official JRE, the internal class `sun.security.util.HostnameChecker` can be wrapped [as described here](http://kevinlocke.name/bits/2012/10/03/ssl-certificate-verification-in-dispatch-and-asynchttpclient/).

If Apache's [HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient) library is available, its [`StrictHostnameVerifier`](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/StrictHostnameVerifier.html) can be used.

On Android, [MemorizingTrustManager](https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager/) provides both certificate checking and hostname verification with interactive fallback, allowing the user to decide about the trustworthiness of a server.

## Affected Applications

Smack is a library used by different applications. Therefore, the authors of the following Smack-based applications have been contacted to coordinate updated releases:

* [ChatSecure](https://guardianproject.info/apps/chatsecure) ([fixed](https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/commit/3f150daded7461255b9d51bfc59ff91f8a77ed81) in 13.2.0-beta1)
* [GTalkSMS](http://code.google.com/p/gtalksms/) (contacted on 2014-07-28)
* [MAXS](http://projectmaxs.org/homepage/) ([tracker issue](https://projectmaxs.atlassian.net/browse/MAXS-25), fixed in [0.0.1.18](https://social.geekplace.eu/notice/2139))
* [yaxim](https://yaxim.org/) and [Bruno](http://yaxim.org/bruno) ([fixed in 0.8.8](https://yaxim.org/blog/2014/08/04/yaxim-0-dot-8-8-important-security-update/))
* *undisclosed Android application* (contacted on 2014-07-21)

The following Smack-based applications were not affected:

* TransVerse (special interest client)
* [Xabber](https://github.com/redsolution/xabber-android) (using a custom `TrustManager` performing hostname verification)

## Timeline

* 2014-07-20 Discovery of Smack vulnerability, notification of Smack maintainer
* 2014-07-21 Notification of vulnerable apps' authors
* 2014-07-27 Release of Smack 4.0.2
