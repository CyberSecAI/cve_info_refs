{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from applications not verifying that the SSL chain is provided by a trusted root certificate authority. The CERT/CC blog provides details on the methodology used to test applications with CERT Tapioca."
