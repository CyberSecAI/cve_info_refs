Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-5516

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism of the KonaKart Storefront Application. While the application correctly checked for CSRF tokens in POST requests, it failed to enforce this protection when state-changing actions were performed using GET requests instead of POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Protection Bypass:** The core issue is the bypass of CSRF protection by using GET requests for actions that should be protected by CSRF tokens.
- **Inconsistent Enforcement:** The vulnerability exists due to inconsistent enforcement of CSRF protection, applying it only to POST methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker could change a victim's email address, enabling a password reset to the attacker's control. This allows the attacker to gain access to and control the victim's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** The attack vector is a classic CSRF attack. An attacker would craft a malicious link or webpage that, when accessed by a logged-in victim, would initiate a GET request to the vulnerable application to change the victim's email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in Victim:** The attacker requires a user to be logged into the KonaKart Storefront Application.
- **Social Engineering/Malicious Link:** The attacker needs to induce the victim to access a malicious link or webpage. This could be achieved through email phishing, forum posts, or other social engineering techniques.
- **Ability to craft a URL:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that will perform the desired action (e.g. change email) with the GET method instead of POST.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in KonaKart version 7.3.0.0
- The report also mentions that an exploit was demonstrated to the vendor where the attacker was able to change a victim's email address and trigger a password reset to gain control over their account.
- The vendor was notified responsibly and fixed the issue.
