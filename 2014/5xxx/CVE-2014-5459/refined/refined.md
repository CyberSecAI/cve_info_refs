A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack against a user (typically the root user) running a pear command, causing an arbitrary file to be overwritten, possibly leading to a denial of service.  CVE-2014-5459 was assigned to this issue.

Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.\n\n**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**\n\n### Patch Availability\n\nPlease see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)\n\n### Third Party Bulletin Schedule\n\nThird Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:\n\n* 14 April 2015\n* 14 July 2015\n* 20 October 2015\n* 19 January 2016\n\n### References\n\n* Oracle Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts main page [ [Oracle Technology Network](/security-alerts/) ]\n* Oracle Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts - Frequently Asked Questions [ [CPU FAQ](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html) ]\n* Risk Matrix definitions [ [Risk Matrix Definitions](/security-alerts/advisorymatrixglossary.html) ]\n* Use of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) by Oracle [ [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) ]\n\n### Modification History\n\n| 2015-January-20 | Rev 1.
