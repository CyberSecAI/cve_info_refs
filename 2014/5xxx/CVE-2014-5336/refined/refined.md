Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of file descriptors when serving custom error pages in the Monkey web server. When serving static files, the server uses a File Descriptor Table (FDT) mechanism. However, when serving a static error page, it bypasses this mechanism and performs a direct `open(2)` system call. Upon closing resources associated with the request, the server would call `mk_vhost_close()`, which didn't properly clear the file descriptor if it was opened directly rather than through the FDT. This leads to a file descriptor leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **File Descriptor Leak:** The core vulnerability is a file descriptor leak that occurs when the server serves custom error pages. The file descriptor associated with the error page is not properly closed.
-   **Inconsistent Resource Management:** The server uses different methods to handle static files and static error pages, resulting in inconsistent resource management (FDT vs direct `open(2)`).
-   **Missing Flag for FD Origin:**  The server didn't track how the file descriptor (`fd_file`) was obtained (via FDT or direct open). This lack of tracking caused the `mk_vhost_close()` to fail in properly closing the file descriptors of custom error pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly sending HTTP requests that trigger the server to return custom error messages, an attacker can cause the server to leak file descriptors. Eventually, the server will exhaust the OS-enforced limit on the number of open file descriptors per process (`ulimit -n`). After that point, the server will be unable to open new files to handle new requests, and even legitimate requests will start failing with HTTP 403 errors. This causes a simple denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP Requests Triggering Errors:** An attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests to cause the server to return custom error pages. This is typically done by requesting non-existent resources or resources that trigger an error response from the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This can be done remotely if the server is exposed to the network.
-   **Knowledge of Error Triggers:** The attacker needs to know how to craft requests to trigger custom error responses from the server (e.g., requesting a non-existent path, an invalid header, etc.).

**Additional Details (from the patch):**
- The fix implemented introduces a new field `fd_is_fdt` to the `session_request` structure to track whether the file descriptor `fd_file` was opened using the FDT mechanism or directly using `open()`.
- The `mk_request_free()` function is modified to check the `fd_is_fdt` flag before closing the file descriptor, ensuring that resources are properly closed, regardless of how they were opened.
- `mk_vhost_fdt_open()` now sets `fd_is_fdt` to `MK_TRUE` when a file is opened through the FDT.
- `mk_request_error()` sets `fd_is_fdt` to `MK_FALSE` when a file is opened directly for an error page.
- `mk_vhost_fdt_close` is modified to close the file descriptor using `close()` function if the file is not opened using FDT mechanism and `mk_vhost_close()` for the opposite case.
