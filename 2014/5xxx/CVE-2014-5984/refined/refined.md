The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they do not verify if the certificate was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation. The applications fail to check the SSL chain to ensure the server certificate is trustworthy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This could enable them to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. Potential consequences include credential theft and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted Android device and able to intercept network traffic. This can include public Wi-Fi or other untrusted networks.
