## Installation

1. Go to **“Plugins”** > **“Add Plugin”**
2. Search for **“Disqus Comment System”** by Disqus
3. Click **“Install Now”**
4. Activate the plugin
5. (**Automatic: easiest**) From the Install page of the Disqus plugin settings, follow the Automatic Installation steps to set up Disqus on your site. During this process, you will need to [create a Disqus account](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/) and register your site. This also creates the API application required for enabling Comment Syncing.
6. (**Manual: fastest**) Enter your site’s [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/466208) in **Site Configuration**. This requires you to have [created a Disqus account](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/) and registered your site.

**NOTE: It is recommended that you [backup your database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database) before installing the plugin.**

#### Syncing comments to WordPress

Comment Syncing copies comments made in Disqus to your WordPress installation as backup in case you ever decide to switch back to native WordPress comments. Syncing is not enabled by default. To enable syncing, you’ll need to set it up either by creating an API application (follow [instructions here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/960360)) or via Automatic Installation in the plugin.

For more information, go to <https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/960360>

## FAQ

### Is Disqus free to use on my site?

Yes! Disqus is free to use. We also provide [subscription plans](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2759918-disqus-pricing-and-plans) for larger, commercial sites that want access to more powerful moderation and audience tools and customization.

### How do I customize the look-and-feel of Disqus?

Disqus automatically checks your site’s font and background color and adapts to either a light or dark color scheme, along with a serif or sans-serif font. If these are detected incorrectly, you can [override them](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/545277-disqus-appearance-tweaks) in your Settings.

### Will I lose comments if I deactivate Disqus?

The Disqus for WordPress plugin automatically syncs comments back to WordPress. These comments will remain in WordPress should Disqus be deactivated or removed. You can also [export your comments](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1104797-importing-exporting#exporting) from Disqus at any time.

### Can I import my existing WordPress comments into Disqus?

Yes, you can import your existing WordPress comments into Disqus during installation.

### How do I set up Single Sign-On (SSO)?

SSO allows users in your database to comment without requiring them to register with Disqus. Access to SSO is currently available as an add-on for users with a [Business subscription](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2759918-disqus-pricing-and-plans#business-plan). If you would like to enable this feature, [contact our Support team](https://disqus.com/support/?article=contact_SSO). Also check out our guide for [setting up SSO on WordPress](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1148635).

I have used Disqus for nine years to add comment functionality to my newsblog. Today they suddenly added LOTS of spam ads above and below their comment fields. I mean a screenful of them. Making my serious webpage look like the worst click-hunter ones. That’s it, I am removing Disqus.

Seems like someone actually put some effort into this plugin.
Comment syncing now actually works, and the UI touchup is appreciated.

The Disqus Comment System plugin wouldn’t load anything on my website scispiracy.com and I tried everything possible. I came here to see if people were having issues like mine and I see that there’s no support from Disqus. I used this plugin a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. But now it just doesn’t work. If there is any support for this plugin, I surely would appreciate it.

This is an horrible plugin. It’s extremely heavy and makes your site very slow. It also put unwanted ads on your website and Disqus ask you to pay them to remove the ads. Despite what they claim, it isn’t AMP Compatible, you need to create domains and tweak the code to make it AMP Compatible when they could just make it compatible right away.
Disqus only care about making money. That plugin has been abandoned for 2 years and is completely crap.
