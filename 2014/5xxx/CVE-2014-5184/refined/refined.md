Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Although the content doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2014-5184, it describes a vulnerability in the WordPress plugin "stripshow", and other sources link this vulnerability to the mentioned CVE. Thus, this analysis will proceed with the assumption that the reported vulnerability is related to CVE-2014-5184.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `stripshow` WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `story` parameter in the `admin.php?page=stripshow-storylines&action=edit` URL is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database using `UNION SELECT` statements. This includes the database version (`@@version`) and database user (`user()`).
*   **Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly shown, SQL injection vulnerabilities can also be used to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability requires administrator access initially, successful exploitation can lead to further privilege escalation within the database system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the WordPress admin interface. Specifically, the attacker modifies the `story` parameter within the URL.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `story` parameter in the `stripshow-storylines` page of the WordPress admin panel is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a WordPress administrator to access the vulnerable page and exploit the SQL injection. This significantly reduces the risk, although the impact of such exploit can be severe.
