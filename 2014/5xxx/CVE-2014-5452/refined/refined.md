Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5452:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `smartplatforms.org` directly references CVE-2014-5452, describing a vulnerability in the handling of table attributes within a CDA stylesheet. The IBM content is unrelated to the vulnerability described by smartplatforms.org, the CVE referenced is actually CVE-2013-5452.

**2. Vulnerability Details (from smartplatforms.org):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive XSLT stylesheet (`CDA.xsl`) used to render Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents. This stylesheet copies all attributes of a `table` element directly into the rendered HTML output without sanitization or validation.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core issue is the lack of sanitization in the XSLT transformation. Specifically, the stylesheet's handling of `table/@*` allows arbitrary attributes, including event handlers like `onmouseover`, to be injected from the CDA document into the rendered HTML.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `onmouseover` attribute of a `table`, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to:
        *   **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
        *   **Application compromise:** Modifying application behavior, redirecting users to malicious sites, and performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious C-CDA document containing a `table` element with a malicious `onmouseover` attribute.
    *   This malicious CDA is then processed by a vulnerable EHR system that uses the flawed `CDA.xsl` stylesheet for rendering.
    *   When a user views the rendered CDA document, their browser executes the injected JavaScript code upon mouseover.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to introduce a malicious CDA document into a system that uses the vulnerable stylesheet. This could involve:
        *   Compromising an external system or process that generates or transmits CDA documents to a vulnerable EHR.
        *   Social engineering to trick a user into uploading a malicious CDA.
        *   Exploiting an existing vulnerability that allows injecting the malicious CDA into the system.
    *   The attacker needs to know that the targeted EHR system is using the vulnerable `CDA.xsl` or a derivative and that it is processing invalid documents.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically located in the  `<xsl:template match="n1:table/@*|n1:thead/@*|n1:tfoot/@*|n1:tbody/@*|n1:colgroup/@*|n1:col/@*|n1:tr/@*|n1:th/@*|n1:td/@*">`  section of the stylesheet, which is designed to copy all attributes of table-related elements.
*   This vulnerability is present because of a "copy all" approach. The XSLT doesn't discriminate against attributes that are not supposed to exist in valid CDA documents.
*   The vulnerability is not unique to a specific EHR system, because the CDA.xsl is a standard stylesheet being used by multiple systems.
*   The content mentions that the information was shared privately with affected vendors before the public disclosure.

**4. Unrelated Content (IBM)**

* The IBM content references CVE-2013-5452 which is for a different vulnerability, an XML external entity attack, in IBM FileNet Content Manager and IBM Content Foundation. This vulnerability is not related to the XSLT issue discussed in the provided smartplatforms.org content.

**In summary, CVE-2014-5452 describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized `table` attributes in a widely used CDA stylesheet, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information and the compromise of the application. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization in the stylesheet.**
