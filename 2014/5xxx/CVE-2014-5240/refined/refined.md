Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in WordPress 3.9.2:

**1. Denial of Service (DoS) in PHP's XML Processing**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in PHP's XML processing that can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
*   **Weakness:** The specific nature of the XML processing vulnerability isn't detailed, but it involves a flaw in how PHP handles XML input, leading to resource exhaustion or other conditions that prevent normal operation.
*   **Impact:**  A successful exploit would lead to a denial of service, making the affected WordPress site unavailable.
*  **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted XML input sent to the WordPress application through a vulnerable entry point.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to send XML data to the WordPress site.

**2. Unlikely Code Execution When Processing Widgets**
*   **Root Cause:** Unsafe serialization vulnerability exists when processing widgets.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability involves unsafe handling of serialized data, potentially allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.
*  **Impact:** If exploited, it could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Attack vector**: The attack vector involves manipulating widget processing.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to influence the serialized data used during widget processing. This is noted as unlikely by default.

**3. Information Disclosure via XML Entity Attacks in GetID3 Library**

*   **Root Cause:** The external GetID3 library used by WordPress was vulnerable to XML entity attacks.
*   **Weakness:**  The GetID3 library did not properly sanitize XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities that could lead to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious XML entities when processing files with GetID3 library.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a file that is processed with the vulnerable GetID3 library.

**4. Brute-Force Attacks Against CSRF Tokens**

*   **Root Cause:** Two vulnerabilities are present in CSRF token generation and comparison
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *  CSRF tokens were built without delimiters, allowing an attacker to predict or brute-force them.
    *  Nonces were not compared in a time-constant manner, making them vulnerable to timing attacks.
*   **Impact:** Successful attacks could allow for Cross-Site Request Forgery, allowing an attacker to make requests on behalf of an authorized user.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation involves crafting requests by predicting or brute-forcing the CSRF tokens.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests.

**5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** There was a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could be triggered by administrators.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability was related to a lack of proper escaping in `get_avatar()` function.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the site, possibly leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.
*  **Attack Vector:** This vulnerability is triggered via crafted data to the `get_avatar()` function.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to have administrator-level access.

**CVE Mapping (from openwall.com content)**

*   **Unsafe serialization vulnerability in widget processing:** CVE-2014-5203
*   **CSRF Token Issues (no delimiters and timing attack):** CVE-2014-5204 & CVE-2014-5205

The XSS vulnerability was not assigned a CVE in this document, pending clarification on privilege escalation in multisite installations.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The WordPress 3.9.2 release includes fixes for these vulnerabilities, and users were urged to upgrade immediately.
*   The release also highlights a joint effort between the WordPress and Drupal security teams.
*   The content also mentions that the security fixes were included in the WordPress 4.0 beta releases.
