Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-5427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from storing passwords in a recoverable format within the Johnson Controls Metasys building management system. Specifically, the system stores password hashes that can be retrieved, instead of using a more secure method such as salting and hashing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format (CWE-257):** The system stores password hashes in a way that allows them to be retrieved through an unauthenticated post request. This implies a weak or non-existent hashing mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can retrieve password hashes of authorized users. These retrieved hashes could then be used to gain unauthorized access to the Metasys system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to view sensitive data, modify system configurations, and disrupt system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Post Request:** An attacker can send an unauthenticated POST request to the Metasys system to retrieve password hashes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Metasys system, but does not need to be on the local network and does not require any authentication to make the malicious request.
- **Low Skill Level:** The document states that an attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory also mentions another vulnerability CVE-2014-5428 related to unrestricted file uploads, but that is separate from CVE-2014-5427.
- The CVSS v2 base score for CVE-2014-5427 is 10.0 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), which means it's remotely exploitable, requires no authentication, and has critical impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Johnson Controls has released patches for the affected Metasys releases (4.1 to 6.5) to mitigate this vulnerability.
