Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-5455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unquoted service path in the Windows service configuration for the "Private Tunnel Core Service" (ptservice). This vulnerability arises because the service's executable path contains spaces and is not enclosed in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unquoted Service Path:** The primary weakness is the lack of quotation marks around the service's binary path in the service configuration. This allows Windows to interpret the path incorrectly, potentially executing arbitrary code located in a parent directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local, non-privileged user to execute arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the "Private Tunnel Core Service," which runs as SYSTEM.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can run malicious code with SYSTEM privileges on the machine, effectively gaining full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to place a malicious executable with a specific filename in a parent directory of the service's install path, before the service is started. For example, placing an executable named "Program.exe" in the C:\ directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the target system.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to a directory in the system's root path (e.g. C:\), so they can place a malicious executable.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to time their attack to coincide with a system startup or service restart to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge:** The attacker must have knowledge of the service's executable path and the vulnerability's mechanics.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable application is OpenVPN Private Tunnel Core Service, specifically version 2.1.28.0 (PrivateTunnel 2.3.8).
- The exploit has been successfully tested on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows XP SP3.
- The exploit is classified as "local" and targets the Windows x86 platform.
- The service runs with SYSTEM privileges.
