2 Bugs ﬁxed since previous Public Release

This document provides a summary of bugﬁxes and changes that have been applied subsequently
to shipping Patch Release #2097.

30599 Exporting calendar oﬀers a .js ﬁle for download
When exporting a speciﬁc calendar folder, the exported CSV contains a corrupted format. It is not
possible to track down this issue to a particular object, therefor corrupted recurring appointments
get skipped and and logging has been extended to track down the bad object.

33394 Message count is diﬀerent in message list and selected pane when select all mes-
sages
This has been ﬁxed by changing the calculation of selected messages.

33489 Password shows up in clear text while viewing personal error logs as user
If a user checked the ”Error Logs” section of the UI, some requests may expose clear text passwords
that the user has entered before. This information is not exposed to any external party, however
to ensure privacy and remove unnecessary output, this has been ﬁxed by replacing all (top-level)
properties that contain the word ”password” by ”****”.

33620 CVE-2014-5235
CVSSv2: 5.7

33715 EAS fetches the mail twice instead of only one time
EAS clients fetched a mail twice because the mail source was not available on ﬁrst fetch. This has
been solved by completely providing the mail including source on the ﬁrst request.

33834 CVE-2014-5236
CVSSv2: 7.4

33835 CVE-2014-5236
CVSSv2: 7.4

33836 CVE-2014-5237

Release Notes for Patch Release #2112

33839 CVE-2014-5234
CVSSv2: 5.7

33914 Cannot drop more than a user capability with a single RMI call
The batch statements to drop the +/- variants of user capabilities used a wrong parameter index.
Therefor, just the ﬁrst supplied capability got dropped when provisioning users via the RMI or SOAP
interface. The parameter index when dropping the +/- variants of user capabilities has been cor-
rected.

33918 I18n service for locale <locale>has no translation
The names of subscription sources have been passed to I18nService regardless if they were Local-
izableStrings or not.
This has been ﬁxed by introducing a new ﬂag to selectively translate subscription sources names.

33919 CVE-2014-5238
CVSSv2: 5.4

33936 Displayname with ampersand not displayed correctly
Caused by incorrect usage of .escape.
This has been ﬁxed.

3 Changes relevant for Administrators

3.1 Changes of Conﬁguration Files

Change #2126 Added new conﬁg item com.openexchange.documentconverter.blacklistFile
to documentconverter.properties
The list of external document content URLs that are not allowed to be loaded by the readerengine
after loading a document.

The ﬁle itself contains a list of (newline separated) regular expressions. Each external URL is ﬁrst
checked against the list of blacklist URL regular expressions. If the external URL matches one black-
list entry, the external URL is then checked against the list of whitelist URL regular expressions.

The behavior in summary is as follows:

• If the URL is not blacklisted and not whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is blacklisted but not whitelisted, it is not resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is not blacklisted but whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is blacklisted and whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• In boolean notation: valid = (!blacklisted) OR whitelisted

Please note that the regular expressions need to fully qualify the patterns that the URL should be
checked against. Upper/Lower cases need to be handled by the regular expression as well. The ﬁle
itself needs to be UTF-8 encoded to be read appropriately.

Default value: ”/opt/open-xchange/etc/readerengine.blacklist”

Change #2127 Added new conﬁg item com.openexchange.documentconverter.whitelistFile
to documentconverter.properties
The list of external document content URLs that are allowed to be loaded by the readerengine after
an external URL matched a blacklist pattern.

The ﬁle itself contains a list of (newline separated) regular expressions. Each external URL is ﬁrst

checked against the list of blacklist URL regular expressions. If the external URL matches one black-
list entry, the external URL is then checked against the list of whitelist URL regular expressions.

The behavior in summary is as follows:

• If the URL is not blacklisted and not whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is blacklisted but not whitelisted, it is not resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is not blacklisted but whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• If the URL is blacklisted and whitelisted, it is resolved at runtime.

• In boolean notation: valid = (!blacklisted) OR whitelisted

Please note that the regular expressions need to fully qualify the patterns that the URL should be
checked against.

Upper/Lower cases need to be handled by the regular expression as well.The ﬁle itself needs to
be UTF-8 encoded to be read appropriately.

Default value: ”/opt/open-xchange/etc/readerengine.whitelist”

Change #2128 Added new conﬁg item com.openexchange.documentconverter.urlLinkLimit
to documentconverter.properties
The external URL link limit speciﬁes the maximum amount of valid external internet URLs (ﬁltered
by blacklist and whitelist before), that are tried to get resolved by the engine when loading a docu-
ment.

When this limit is reached, no more external internet URLs are resolved for the current document.

Please note, that this limit is not directly related to the amount of visible linked objects within
the document. The code itself often needs to resolve one URL more than once or even twice to
ﬁnish loading of the objects’ content.
In addition, the URL link limit not only aﬀects the amount of URLs, resolved within the viewer but
also the amount of resolved URLs when printing or downloading a document, so that the appear-
ance of a viewed and of a printed/downloaded document is similar in general.

Set to -1 for no upper limit or to 0 to disable the resolving of internet URLs completely

Default value: 200

Change #2129 Added new conﬁg item com.openexchange.documentconverter.urlLinkProxy
to documentconverter.properties
The external URL link proxy conﬁg entry speciﬁes a proxy server, that is used by the readerengine
to resolve external links, contained within a document. Such links are e.g. external http:// graphic
links, that are going to be resolved during the ﬁltering process of a readerengine instance.

Set this entry to the address of the proxy server: host:port

Recognized protocols for object URLs to be resolved by the proxy are: http://, https:// and ftp://

Leave empty, if no proxy server should be used by the readerengine.

Default value: n/a

4 Tests

The Open-Xchange QA team has successfully veriﬁed all bug ﬁxes that could be reproduced within
a lab environment.
