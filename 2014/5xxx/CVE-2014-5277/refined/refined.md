The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5277.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Docker's client, daemon, and registry potentially falling back to SSL protocols lower than TLS 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure fallback to older SSL protocols (below TLS 1.0).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially downgrade the connection to a less secure protocol, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where they could intercept and potentially manipulate data being transferred between client and server or registry.

**Attack Vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle attack during the TLS handshake process. An attacker intercepts the connection and forces the use of a weaker protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Docker client, daemon, or registry and needs to be able to manipulate the TLS handshake to force the use of a lower SSL/TLS protocol.
