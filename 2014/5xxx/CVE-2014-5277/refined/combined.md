An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
Docker was updated to version 1.3.1 to fix two security issues and several
other bugs.
These security issues were fixed:
- Prevent fallback to SSL protocols lower than TLS 1.0 for client, daemon
and registry (CVE-2014-5277).
- Secure HTTPS connection to registries with certificate verification and
without HTTP fallback unless `--insecure-registry` is specified.
These non-security issues were fixed:
- Fix issue where volumes would not be shared
- Fix issue with `--iptables=false` not automatically setting
`--ip-masq=false`
- Fix docker run output to non-TTY stdout
- Fix escaping `$` for environment variables
- Fix issue with lowercase `onbuild` Dockerfile instruction
- Restrict envrionment variable expansion to `ENV`, `ADD`, `COPY`,
`WORKDIR`, `EXPOSE`, `VOLUME` and `USER`
- docker `exec` allows you to run additional processes inside existing
containers
- docker `create` gives you the ability to create a container via the cli
without executing a process
- `--security-opts` options to allow user to customize container labels
and apparmor profiles
- docker `ps` filters
- Wildcard support to copy/add
- Move production urls to get.docker.com from get.docker.io
- Allocate ip address on the bridge inside a valid cidr
- Use drone.io for pr and ci testing
- Ability to setup an official registry mirror
- Ability to save multiple images with docker `save`
go was updated to version 1.3.3 to fix one security issue and several
other bugs.
This security issue was fixed:
- TLS client authentication issue (CVE-2014-7189).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- Avoid stripping debuginfo on arm, it fails (and is not necessary)
- Revert the /usr/share/go/contrib symlink as it caused problems during
update. Moved all go sources to /usr/share/go/contrib/src instead of
/usr/share/go/contrib/src/pkg and created pkg and src symlinks in
contrib to add it to GOPATH
- Fixed %go\_contribsrcdir value
- Copy temporary macros.go as go.macros to avoid it to be built
- Do not modify Source: files, because that makes the .src.rpm being tied
to one specific arch.
- Removed extra src folder in /usr/share/go/contrib: the goal is to
transform this folder into a proper entry for GOPATH. This folder is now
linked to %{\_libdir}/go/contrib
- go requires gcc to build sources using cgo
- tools-packaging.patch: Allow building cover and vet tools in
$GOROOT\_TARGET/pkg/tool instead of $GOROOT/pkg/tool. This will allow
building go tools as a separate package
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2014-660
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=898901#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-29 06:19:53 UTC  ``` via oss-sec  From the Go 1.3.2 release announcement:  "The crpyto/tls fix addresses a security bug that affects programs that use crypto/tls to implement a TLS server from Go 1.1 onwards. If the server enables TLS client authentication using certificates (this is rare) and explicitly sets SessionTicketsDisabled to true in the tls.Config, then a malicious client can falsely assert ownership of any client certificate it wishes."  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/golang-nuts/eeOHNw_shwU/OHALUmroA5kJ> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=898901#c1)  SMASH SMASH   2014-09-29 06:25:19 UTC  ``` Affected packages:  SLE-12: go ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=898901#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-10-01 12:07:27 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=898901#c4)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2014-10-31 10:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (898901) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/259106> 13.2 / go ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=898901#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-13 09:04:50 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2014:1411-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
