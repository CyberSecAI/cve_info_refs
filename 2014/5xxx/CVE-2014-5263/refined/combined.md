Subject: CVE Request --  qemu: missing field list terminator in
 vmstate_xhci_event

It was found that vmstate_xhci_event field list was missing
VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST() terminator and traversing through this list
would result in out-of-bounds access during vm state saving and
loading.

Depending on how vmstate_xhci_event is placed in the qemu binary,
this issue can range from non-issue, infinite loop to (potentially)
privilege escalation in case the we end up with fields that have info
and/or field_exist members initialized in a way that is useful for
exploitation (most probably unlikely).

In the worst case, attacker able to alter the migration data could
use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory.

Upstream commit:
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=3afca1d6d413592c2b78cf28f52fa24a586d8f56>

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer
* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Laszlo Ersek discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in the vga

device. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary

host memory. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2014-3615](/security/CVE-2014-3615))

Xavier Mehrenberger and Stephane Duverger discovered that QEMU incorrectly

handled certain udp packets when using guest networking. A malicious guest

could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3640](/security/CVE-2014-3640))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled parameter validation in

the vmware\_vga device. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to

write into memory of the host, leading to privilege escalation.

([CVE-2014-3689](/security/CVE-2014-3689))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB xHCI controller live

migration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-5263](/security/CVE-2014-5263))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in the

ACPI PCI hotplug interface. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue

to access memory of the host, leading to information disclosure or

privilege escalation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-5388](/security/CVE-2014-5388))

James Spadaro discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain VNC

bytes\_per\_pixel values. An attacker having access to a VNC console could

possibly use this issue to cause a guest to crash, resulting in a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-7815](/security/CVE-2014-7815))
