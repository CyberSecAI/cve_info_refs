{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificate on SSL/TLS."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from Android applications not validating the SSL chain to ensure the certificate comes from a trusted root certificate authority. The provided spreadsheet lists the affected apps and libraries. CERT Tapioca was used to test applications. This issue can be mitigated by using a web browser to access resources instead of an affected application and avoiding untrusted networks such as public wifi."
