## Paper

This work was presented in [CHES
2014](http://www.chesworkshop.org/ches2014/) and published in its proceedings. An [extended
version (PDF, 5.3MB)](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/handsoff-20140731.pdf) is available, archived as [IACR
ePrint 2014/626](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/626).

## Updates

* In February 2015 we published a follow-up paper, "[Stealing
  Keys from PCs using a Radio: Cheap Electromagnetic Attacks on
  Windowed Exponentiation](../radioexp/)",  which shows how to extract RSA
  and ElGamal keys from modern implementations (that use windowed
  exponentiation), in a few seconds, using cheap radio receivers.
* In February 2016 we published a follow-up paper, "[ECDH
  Key-Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Electromagnetic Attacks on PCs](../ecdh/)",
  about electromagnetic attacks on Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
  encryption.
* In March 2016 we
  published another follow-up paper, "[ECDSA Key
  Extraction from Mobile Devices via Nonintrusive Physical Side
  Channels](../mobilesc/)", about extracting ECDSA secret keys from mobile
  phones.

## Overview

We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software
implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our
attacks use novel side channels and are based on the observation that
the "ground" electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a
computation-dependent way. An attacker can measure this signal by
touching exposed metal on the computer's chassis with a plain wire, or
even with a bare hand. The signal can also be measured at the remote end
of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables.

Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have
extracted 4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via
each of these channels, as well as via power analysis and
electromagnetic probing. Despite the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops
and numerous noise sources, the full attacks require a few seconds of
measurements using Medium Frequency signals (around 2 MHz), or one hour
using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz).

We have extracted keys from laptops of various models, running [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/index.html)
(popular open source encryption software, implementing the [OpenPGP](http://www.openpgp.org/)
standard). The attacks exploit several side channels, enumerated below:

* ***Chassis potential.*** The electric
  potential on the chassis of laptop computers fluctuates in reference
  to the mains earth ground. This potential can be measured by a simple
  wire, non-invasively touching a conductive part of the laptop (such as
  the metal heatsink fins or shielding of USB, Ethernet, VGA,
  DisplayPort and HDMI ports), and connected to a suitable amplifier and
  digitizer. The chassis potential, thus measured, is affected by
  ongoing computation, and our attacks exploit this to extract RSA and
  ElGamal keys, within a few seconds.

  ![chassis measurement](wire.png)
  *Scenarios.* The wire can be fixed in advance in a location
  where the target laptop will be placed (e.g., a cluttered desk), or
  put in contact with the laptop by a passerby.
* ***Far end of cable.*** When a cable is
  plugged into one of the laptop's IO ports (such as USB, Ethernet, VGA,
  DisplayPort and HDMI), the port's shield typically contacts a plug
  shield, which in turn is connected to a conductive cable shield
  running the length of the cable. Thus, one can measure the chassis
  potential from the *far* side of cables connected to the
  aforementioned ports. Ethernet cables, for example, often span long
  distances, across and between building floors. An attacker who gains
  access to the far side of the cable, or taps the shield along the way,
  can measure the approximate chassis potential.

  ![far-end-of-cable-attack](far-end-of-cable.png)
  *Scenarios.* A simple voltage measurement device, perhaps
  located in the cabinet or server room to which the cable leads, could
  capture the leakage. This is hard to check, since Ethernet wiring and
  projectors' VGA cables are often hidden out of sight and cannot easily
  be tracked by the user.
* ***Human touch.*** The attacker can measure the
  chassis potential by merely touching a conductive part of the laptop
  chassis with his hand, while surreptitiously measuring his own body
  potential relative to the ground potential of the room. (This attack
  is especially effective in hot weather, since sweaty fingers offer
  lower electric resistance.) If good contact cannot be made using
  exposed metal parts of the chassis, a metallic pen can be used to make
  good contact with the laptop's heatsink fins.

  ![magic touch attack](touch.png)
  *Scenarios.* The attacker positions himself in physical
  proximity to the target laptop and touches it with his bare hand or a
  conducting pen. Surreptitiously, the attacker carries the requisite
  equipment for measuring his body potential relative to some nearby
  grounded object. In the [non-adaptive attack](#bit-extract),
  a few seconds' contact will suffice; in the [adaptive
  attack](#bit-extract), 1 key bit can be extracted approximately every 4
  seconds.

We also revisit two traditional physical side channels and demonstrate
their applicability to software running on PCs:

* ***Electromagnetic (EM).*** We performed key
  extraction by measuring the induced EM emanations, using an antenna
  (near-field probe) placed near the laptop.

  *Scenarios*.  Electromagnetic probes are easily hidden in
  nearby objects. A glove, containing a concealed probe loop and
  hovering over the target laptop, would unveil its key within seconds.
* ***Power.*** Likewise, we extracted keys by
  measuring the electric current draw on the laptop's power supply. Our
  attack works even though PCs use complex switching power supplies,
  which partially decouple the power source from the CPU load, and
  moreover employ large capacitors, chokes, and shields for
  electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) compliance  all of which
  attenuate and disrupt the signals sought in traditional power
  analysis.

  *Scenarios.* A public charging station can be easily augmented
  with a current meter, logger, and transmitter. Even a regular power
  supply "brick" can be similarly augmented, and such laptop power
  supplies are often shared, offered to guests, or left unattended.

In a recent paper, we also demonstrated attacks using [acoustic
emanations](http://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic), i.e., using microphones to record the sound made by
computers' electronics and deducing the secret keys.

## Q&A

### Q1: What information is leaked?

###

 This depends on the specific
computer hardware. We have tested numerous laptop computers, and found the
following:

* In almost all machines, it is possible to distinguish an idle
  CPU (x86 "HLT") from a busy CPU.
* On many machines, it is moreover possible to distinguish different
  patterns of CPU operations and different programs.
* Using [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/) as our study case,
  we can, on some machines:
  + distinguish between the spectral signatures of different RSA
    secret keys (signing or decryption), and
  + fully extract decryption keys, by measuring the laptop's chassis
    potential during decryption of a chosen ciphertext.

A good way to visualize the signal is as a spectrogram, which plots the
measured power as a function of time and frequency. For example, in the
following spectrogram, time runs vertically (spanning 10 seconds) and
frequency runs horizontally (spanning 0-2.3 MHz).  During this time,
the CPU performed loops of different operations (multiplications,
additions, memory accesses, etc.). One can easily discern when the CPU is
conducting each operation, due to the different spectral signatures.

![various CPU operations](resized_chassis-rattlew-n200.png)

### Q2: Why does this happen?

The electric potential on a laptop computer's chassis (metal panels,
shields and ports) is ideally equal to that of the mains earth ground
potential, but in reality it fluctuates greatly. Even when the laptop is
grounded (via its power supply or via shielded cables such as Ethernet,
USB or VGA), there is non-negligible impedance between the grounding
point(s) and other points in the chassis. Due to currents and
electromagnetic fields inside the computer, voltages of large magnitude
develop across this impedance (often
10mV RMS or more, after filtering out the 50 or 60 Hz mains frequency).
This is the voltage we measure.

### Q3: Does the attack require special equipment?

 While the attack is most
effective using professional lab equipment, a regular mobile phone is
sometimes good enough. For example, we have used a mobile phone to measure
the key-dependent chassis potential from the far side of a 10m Ethernet
cable, as shown here:
![mobile phone attack](web_phone-ethernet.jpg)

The above picture shows a mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) being used to
measure the chassis potential of the laptop from the far side of a 10
meter long Ethernet cable (blue). An alligator clip connected to a plain
wire (green) taps the shield of the Ethernet cable where it connects to an
Ethernet switch. The signal passes, through a simple passive filter, into
the microphone/earphone jack of the phone, where it is amplified and
digitized. The phone itself is grounded to mains earth via its USB port.
It is possible to perform the adaptive attack using this setup.

### Q4: What if I can't physically touch the computer or any of its cables and peripherals?

There are still two attacks that require only proximity, not direct
contact:

* *Electromagnetic emanations*, measured via an antenna, convey
  essentially the same leakage and (as we show in the [above
  paper](#paper)) can be used for key extraction.
* *Acoustic emanations (sound)*, measured via a microphone, can
  also be used to extract keys, as we showed in a [previous
  paper](http://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic).

###

### Q5: What's new since your paper on [acoustic cryptanalysis](http://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic)?

* *New attack channels.* The new channels discussed here are
  physically different than the acoustic channel, and result in
  different attack scenarios.
* *New cryptographic technique*. In addition to the bit-by-bit
  adaptive attack presented in the previous paper, which requires
  thousands of decryption operations for key extraction, we employ
  a  new non-adaptive attack that recovers the complete key using
  the leakage obtained by just a few decryption operations. This reduces
  the attack time from an *hour* to a few *seconds*.

### Q6: Can an attacker use power analysis instead?

Yes, power analysis (measuring the current drawn from the laptop's DC
power supply) is another way to perform our low-bandwidth attack.

Traditional power analysis would measure power consumption at a
frequency comparable to the CPU's clockrate (a few GHz), and is foiled
by dampening emanations at these frequencies. Our attack extracts the
key using much lower bandwidth (a few kHz to a few MHz, depending on
settings and duration). Our attack is also more resilient to filtering
and noise.

### Q7: How can low-frequency (kHz) leakage provide useful information about a much faster (GHz) computation?

This is the key idea behind our technique. Individual CPU operations are
too fast for our measurement equipment to pick up, but long operations
(e.g., modular exponentiation in RSA) can create a characteristic (and
detectable) spectral signature over many milliseconds. Using a
chosen-ciphertext, we are able to use the algorithm's  *own*
code to amplify its own key-leakage, creating very drastic changes,
detectable even by low-bandwidth means.
### Q8: How vulnerable is GnuPG now?

We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under [CVE-2013-4576](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4576)
and [CVE-2014-5270](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5270),
suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to test
them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies GnuPG
2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to the key-extraction
attack described here, were released concurrently with the first public
posting of these results.

GnuPG version 1.4.16 onwards, and libgcrypt 1.6.0 onwards, resist the
key-extraction attack described here. Some of the effects we discovered
(including RSA key distinguishability) remain present.
### Q9: How vulnerable are other algorithms and cryptographic implementations?

This is an open research question. Our attack requires careful
cryptographic analysis of the implementation, which so far has been
conducted only for the GnuPG 1.x implementation of RSA. Implementations
using ciphertext blinding (a common side channel countermeasure) appear
less vulnerable.
### Q10: Is there a realistic way to perform a chosen-ciphertext attack on GnuPG?

We found a way to cause GnuPG to automatically decrypt ciphertexts
chosen by the attacker. The idea is to use encrypted e-mail messages
following the [OpenPGP](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880)
and [PGP/MIME](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3516)
protocols. For example, [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/)
(a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically
decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An
attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims, wait until
they reach the target computer, and observe the target's chassis
potential during their decryption (as shown above), thereby closing the
attack loop.

### Q11: What countermeasures are available?

###

Physical mitigation techniques include Faraday cages (against EM attacks),
insulating enclosures (against chassis and touch attacks), and
photoelectric decoupling or fiberoptic connections (against "far end of
cable" attacks). However, inexpensive protection of consumer-grade PCs
appears difficult, especially for the chassis channel.

Alternatively, the cryptographic software can be changed, and algorithmic
techniques employed to render the emanations less useful to the attacker.
These techniques ensure that the rough-scale behavior of the algorithm is
independent of the inputs it receives; they usually carry some performance
penalty, but are often used in any case to thwart other side-channel
attacks. This is what we helped implement in GnuPG (see [Q8](#Q-GnuPG)).
### Q12: Why software countermeasures? Isn't it the hardware's responsibility to avoid physical leakage?

It is tempting to enforce proper layering, and decree that preventing
physical leakage is the responsibility of the physical hardware.
Unfortunately, such low-level leakage prevention is often impractical
due to the very bad cost vs. security tradeoff: (1) any leakage remnants
can often be amplified by suitable manipulation at the higher levels, as
we indeed do in our chosen-ciphertext attack; (2) low-level mechanisms
try to protect all computation, even though most of it is insensitive or
does not induce easily-exploitable leakage; and (3) leakage is often an
inevitable side effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms
(e.g., consider [cache
attacks](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache.pdf)).

Application-layer, algorithm-specific mitigation, in contrast, prevents
the (inevitably) leaked signal from bearing any useful information. It
is often cheap and effective, and most cryptographic software (including
GnuPG and libgcrypt) already includes various sorts of mitigation, both
through explicit code and through choice of algorithms. In fact, the
side-channel resistance of software implementations is nowadays a major
concern in the choice of cryptographic primitives, and was an explicit
evaluation criterion in NIST's AES and SHA-3 competitions.

### Q13: What does the RSA leakage look like?

Here is an example of a spectrogram (which plots the measured power as a
function of time and frequency) for a recording of GnuPG decrypting
several RSA ciphertexts:

![spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions](resized_n200-manykeys-chassis.png "spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions")

In this spectrogram, the horizontal axis (frequency) spans ranges from 1.9
MHz to 2.6 MHz, and the vertical axis (time) spans 1.7 seconds. Each
yellow arrow points to the middle of a GnuPG RSA decryption. It is easy to
see where each decryption starts and ends. Notice the change in the middle
of each decryption operation, spanning several frequency bands. This is
because, internally, each GnuPG RSA decryption first exponentiates modulo
the secret prime *p* and then modulo the secret prime *q*
, and we can actually see the difference between these stages.
Moreover, each of these pairs looks different because each decryption uses
a different key. So in this example, by simply observing the chassis
potential during decryption operations, we can distinguish between
different secret keys,
### Q14: How do you extract the secret key bits?

This depends on the attack type. In the paper we present two types of
attacks.

* *Non-Adaptive attack.* Here, we are able to extract all the
  bits from the leakage obtained by measuring the chassis potential
  during just a few decyption operations using a single ciphertext. The
  attacker generates a suitable ciphertext and triggers decryptions of
  it while analyzing the chassis potential of the target. The picture
  below is a typical result of such a recording (after signal
  processing).

  ![leakge of all the key bits](demod-graph.png "leakge of all the key bits")

  While this already allows the extraction of some key-bits, notice the
  interrupt (marked by a green arrow), which "hides" some of the key
  bits. A few additional recordings are needed in order to recover all
  the bits.
* *Adaptive attack.* This technique (similar to the one used in
  [acoustic
  cryptanalysis](http://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic)) finds the secret key bits one by one,
  sequentially. For each bit, the attacker crafts a ciphertext of a
  special form, in which the leakage depends specifically on the value
  of that bit. The attacker then triggers a decryption of that
  chosen ciphertext, records the chassis potential, and analyzes it. The
  following demonstrates a typical stage of this attack, focusing on a
  single secret key bit. If this bit is 0, then decryption of the chosen
  ciphertext will look like the left-side spectrogram (with a strong
  component at 26.5 kHz). If the secret bit is 1, the decryption will
  look like the right-side spectrogram (where the strong component is at
  31.5 kHz).

  ![spectrogram of leakage that depends on the value of the key bit](web_bit-extraction.jpg "spectrograms of leakage that depends on the value of the key bit")

  Using automated signal classification, the attack distinguishes these
  cases and deduces the secret key bit.

Package        : gnupg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-5270
Debian Bug     : 725411

Genkin, Pipman and Tromer discovered a side-channel attack on Elgamal
encryption subkeys (CVE-2014-5270).

In addition, this update hardens GnuPG's behaviour when treating
keyserver responses; GnuPG now filters keyserver responses to only
accepts those keyid's actually requested by the user.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u6.

For the testing (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem has been fixed in version 1.4.18-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.

Hi!

While evaluating the "Get Your Hands Off My Laptop" [1] paper I missed
to describe [2] a software combination which has not been fixed and is
thus vulnerable to the attack described by the paper.  If you are using
a GnuPG version with a *Libgcrypt version < 1.6.0*, it is possible to
mount the described side-channel attack on Elgamal encryption subkeys.
To check whether you are using a vulnerable Libgcrypt version, enter

  gpg2 --version

on the command line; the second line of the output gives the Libgcrypt
version:

  gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.25
  libgcrypt 1.5.3

In this example Libgcrypt is vulnerable.  If you see 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 you
are fine.  GnuPG versions since 1.4.16 are not affected because they do
not use Libgcrypt.

The recommendation is to update any Libgcrypt version below 1.6.0 to at
least the latest version from the 1.5 series which is 1.5.4.  Updating
to 1.6.1 is also possible but that requires to rebuild GnuPG.

Libgcrypt 1.5.4 has been released yesterday [3]; for convenience I
include the download instructions below.  A CVE-id has not yet been
assigned.

Many thanks to Daniel Genkin for pointing out this problem.

Shalom-Salam,

   Werner

[3] <http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2014q3/000351.html>

Download
========

Libgcrypt source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors
as listed at <https://www.gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html> .  On the
primary server the source tarball and its digital signature are:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2 (1478k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2.sig

That file is bzip2 compressed.  A gzip compressed version is here:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz (1763k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz.sig

Alternativley you may upgrade using this patch file:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.3-1.5.4.diff.bz2 (17k)

In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you are going to build
is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following
ways:

 * Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:

     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2.sig

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
   should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
   by the release signing key 4F25E3B6 which is certified by my well
   known key 1E42B367.  To retrieve the keys you may use the command
   "gpg --fetch-key finger:[wk at g10code.com](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnupg-announce)".

 * If you are not able to use GnuPG, you have to verify the SHA-1
   checksum:

     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:

bdf4b04a0d2aabc04ab3564fbe38fd094135aa7a  libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2
71e432e0ae8792076a40c6059667997250abbb9d  libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz
8876ae002751e6ec26c76e510d17fc3e0eccb3ed  libgcrypt-1.5.3-1.5.4.diff.bz2

Watching out for possible security problems and working with researches
to fix them takes a lot of time.  g10 Code GmbH, a German company owned
and headed by me, is bearing these costs.  To help us carry on this
work, we need your support; please see <https://gnupg.org/donate/> .

As far as we can tell, you are probably asking for a CVE ID for the
vulnerability with the "touching exposed metal on the computer's
chassis" attack vector and the impact of determining Elgamal
encryption subkeys. Use CVE-2014-5270. Some additional details,
probably less relevant to most readers, are included below.

> (This may be similar sort of issue to CVE-2013-4242.)

We don't think it is especially similar. CVE-2013-4242 is about
information leaks in the caching implementation of Intel x86
processors. The existing CVE that is related to the above 000352.html
reference is CVE-2013-4576.

More specifically, 000352.html is about the
<http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/> document. This document says
"We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under CVE-2013-4576,
suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to
test them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies
GnuPG 2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to the
key-extraction attack described here, were released concurrently with
the first public posting of these results. GnuPG version 1.4.16
onwards, and libgcrypt 1.6.0 onwards, resist the key-extraction attack
described here." The authors of this document may have intended for
CVE-2013-4576 to apply to both the acoustic attack vector and the
"exposed metal" attack vector. Also, note that the primary
CVE-2013-4576 reference does mention "exposed metal" (first line of
page 5). However, that reference does not demonstrate how to use
"exposed metal" to exploit a vulnerability. Furthermore,
<http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/> says:

  Q5: What's new since your paper on acoustic cryptanalysis?
  New attack channels. The new channels discussed here are physically
  different than the acoustic channel, and result in different attack
  scenarios.

Thus, we think it is best to have a separate CVE ID (CVE-2014-5270)
for the new information about the use of "exposed metal" in practical
vulnerability exploitation, and to maintain CVE-2013-4576 as bound
solely to acoustic attacks. Please keep in mind, though, that the
vector difference between CVE-2014-5270 and CVE-2013-4576 is based
only on different science, not different software behavior. As far as
we know, the acoustic attack and "exposed metal" attack are
characterized by:

  - the same affected and unaffected versions of every product
  - the same underlying issue in the code
  - the same code fixes (e.g., ciphertext normalization and ciphertext
    randomization)

Specifically, the primary CVE-2013-4576 reference says "New versions
of GnuPG ... and libgcrypt, containing these countermeasures and
resisting our current key-extraction attack, were released
concurrently with this paper's first public posting." We think this
means that Libgcrypt 1.6.0 had the CVE-2013-4576 fix, even though
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2013q4/000336.html>
does not mention fixing an acoustic issue.

Finally, about other vulnerabilities that are different from both
CVE-2013-4576 and CVE-2014-5270:

1. Both the primary CVE-2013-4576 reference and the primary
CVE-2014-5270 reference mention that RSA key distinguishability
remains present in all software versions. The primary CVE-2014-5270
reference adds that "mitigating it in software, without a large
overhead, remains an open problem." There is currently no CVE ID for
this key-distinguishability issue. At least at present, the rationale
is roughly that preventing key distinguishability is outside the scope
of what the software offers.

2. The Description section of
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1128531> refers to the
above 000352.html but lists
<http://www.cs.unc.edu/~reiter/papers/2012/CCS.pdf> as a reference. This
CCS.pdf document seems to be completely unrelated to the acoustic and
"exposed metal" issues. If anyone is interested in one or more
CVE-2012-#### IDs for CCS.pdf, please specify what aspects of the
paper are about vulnerabilities that belong in CVE, and whether you
feel that each is a vulnerability in GnuPG or libgcrypt, or a
vulnerability in Xen.

Package        : libgcrypt11
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-5270

Daniel Genkin, Itamar Pipman and Eran Tromer discovered that Elgamal
encryption subkeys in applications using the libgcrypt11 library, for
example GnuPG 2.x, could be leaked via a side-channel attack.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.0-5+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.
