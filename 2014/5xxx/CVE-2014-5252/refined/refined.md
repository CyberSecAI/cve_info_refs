{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-5252",
    "description": "A flaw was found in keystone revocation events that resulted in the \"issued_at\" time being updated when a token created by the V2 API was processed by the V3 API. This could allow a user to evade token revocation. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events and UUID tokens were affected.",
    "affected_component": "OpenStack Keystone",
    "root_cause": "When a V2 token is processed by the V3 API, the issued_at time is incorrectly regenerated, leading to a mismatch with revocation events, which are stored with the original issued_at time.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of token 'issued_at' time during V2 to V3 API conversion.",
      "Failure to revoke V2 tokens when validated via V3 API due to mismatched issued_at time."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass token revocation by using a V2 token and repeatedly accessing resources using the V3 API, effectively evading token expiration.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote authenticated attacker holding a valid V2 token could exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "A valid V2 token issued by OpenStack Keystone",
      "Access to the V3 API endpoint for token validation/use"
    ]
  }
