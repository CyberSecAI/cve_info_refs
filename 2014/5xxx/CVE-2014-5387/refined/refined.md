Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist within the EllisLab ExpressionEngine Core. Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable:
- `tbl_sort[0][]` parameter in the comment module.
- `column_filter` parameter in the members module.
- `category[]` parameter when publishing content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful attack could allow an authenticated attacker to:
- Access sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
- Potentially modify or delete data in the database

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending crafted HTTP POST requests to specific URLs with malicious SQL code injected into vulnerable parameters. The specific vulnerable URLs and parameters are:
  - `/ex/system/index.php?S=[...]&D=cp&C=addons_modules&M=show_module_cp&module=comment` with the `tbl_sort%5B0%5D%5B%5D` parameter.
  - `/ExpressEngine/system/index.php?S=[...]&D=cp&C=members&M=view_all_members` with the `column_filter` parameter.
  - `/ExpressEngine/system/index.php?/cp/content_publish/entry_form&channel_id=[...]&entry_id=[...]` with the `category[]` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ExpressionEngine application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URLs.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerabilities were found by Jerzy Kramarz and Alex Murillo Moya.
- The vulnerability affects ExpressionEngine Core versions prior to 2.9.0.
- The fixed version is 2.9.1
- The advisory provides sample HTTP requests demonstrating how to exploit each vulnerability.
