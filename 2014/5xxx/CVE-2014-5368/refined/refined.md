Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-5368:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input passed to the `file_get_contents()` function within the WordPress plugin "wp-source-control". Specifically, the `downloadfiles/download.php` script does not properly sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The plugin is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: A remote attacker can gain access to arbitrary files on the server, which can be read by the web server process.
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially access sensitive files like `wp-config.php`, which contains WordPress database credentials (database address, username, and password).
- Privilege Escalation: In certain environments, access to database credentials could lead to privilege escalation and malicious PHP code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `downloadfiles/download.php` script.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- No authentication is required as it's a remote unauthenticated vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the plugin's path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is named "wp-source-control".
- The vulnerable file is `downloadfiles/download.php`.
- The proof-of-concept URL is: `/wp-content/plugins/wp-source-control/downloadfiles/download.php?path=../../../../wp-config.php`
- All versions of the plugin up to and including 3.0.0 are vulnerable.
