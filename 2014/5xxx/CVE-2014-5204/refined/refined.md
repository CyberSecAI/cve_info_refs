Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way WordPress generates and verifies nonces (CSRF tokens). Specifically:
    - **Lack of Delimiters:** When creating a nonce hash, the individual components (action and user ID) were concatenated without a delimiter. This allowed for collisions (e.g., "post1" + "user23"  could collide with "post12" + "user3"), making them potentially vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    - **Timing Attacks:** The comparison of nonces was not performed in constant time, making it possible for an attacker to potentially deduce the correct nonce by measuring the time it takes for the comparison function to return. This is often referred to as a timing attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Token Brute-Force:**  Without proper delimiters, the nonce generation was susceptible to brute-force attacks. This could enable attackers to guess a valid token by trying combinations until they find one that matches.
- **Timing Vulnerability:** The comparison operation wasn't constant time, which could be exploited to leak information about the nonce.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If successful, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protections. This could lead to the execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Brute-Force:** Attempting to guess valid nonces by trying multiple combinations of characters, exploiting the lack of delimiters in nonce generation.
- **Timing Attack:** Observing the time taken by the verification process to potentially leak information about the nonce, which could be used to guess valid ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to make requests to the WordPress site that uses nonces, making them able to observe verification results through either brute force attempts or timing analysis.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this issue involved two main changes:
    1. **Adding Delimiters:** Introduced delimiters ("|") when building nonce hashes.
    2. **Using `hash_equals()`:** Replaced the insecure comparison of nonce hashes with the constant-time `hash_equals()` function to prevent timing attacks, also included as a polyfill for older PHP versions.
- The affected versions were WordPress 2.0.3 - 3.9.1 (excluding 3.7.4 and 3.8.4).
- This vulnerability was reported by David Tomaschik of the Google Security Team.
