      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-5500",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Zimbra is susceptible to Cookie Re-Use attack (CWE-384) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
       "details": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that Zimbra's logout button doesn't invalidate the stored cookie. This means that if an attacker obtains the Zimbra cookies while the session is active, they could access Zimbra even after the user has logged off. \n\nAdditionally, there are XSS vulnerabilities present in the Zimbra web client, specifically in the Firefox sidebar and message view. These vulnerabilities are due to improper encoding of user-generated content.",
      "affected_component": "Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS)",
      "root_cause": "Design deficiency in session management and improper handling of user-generated content",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cookie Re-Use vulnerability (CWE-384): The session cookie is not invalidated upon logout, allowing an attacker to reuse the stolen cookie.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79): User-generated content is not properly encoded, allowing malicious scripts to be injected via the Firefox sidebar and message view."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's Zimbra account by reusing stolen cookies. XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to account compromise or data theft.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could obtain a user's session cookies through various means (e.g., XSS, malware) and use them to access the account after the user has logged out. The XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious input that is displayed in the Firefox sidebar or message view.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie. For XSS, the attacker needs to inject malicious scripts into user-generated content.  An attacker with network access to the vulnerable application could potentially exploit this.",
        "additional_notes": "The fix for the cookie reuse vulnerability involves server-side validation of auth tokens by storing them in LDAP and invalidating them upon logout.  The XSS vulnerabilities were addressed by adding HTML encoding for all user-generated content like subject, from display name, and fragment."
