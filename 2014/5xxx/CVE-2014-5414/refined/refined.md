- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restriction on excessive authentication attempts when using the Automation Device Specification (ADS) protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the absence of mechanisms to limit the rate or number of failed login attempts via the ADS protocol, which allows for brute-force attacks. This corresponds to CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to systems and potentially read or manipulate transmitted information, including passwords. This is achieved by rapidly testing many username/password combinations via the ADS protocol.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, leveraging the ADS protocol over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the target system and knowledge of the ADS protocol. Low skill level is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
