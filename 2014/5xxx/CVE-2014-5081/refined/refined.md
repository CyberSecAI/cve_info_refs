Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-5081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `auth.php` file of Sphider search engine versions prior to 1.3.6, 3.2 for Sphider-Pro, and 3.2 for Sphider-Plus. Specifically, the lack of proper exit() after authentication allows users to bypass authentication by sending arbitrary credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism due to the missing `exit()` statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface of Sphider.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin.php` or `auth.php` files, containing arbitrary user and password parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sphider application.
*   **No Prior Credentials Required:** No valid user credentials are required for this bypass to work.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves sending a POST request with arbitrary `user` and `pass` parameters to the login endpoint, which bypasses the authentication logic before the fix.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding an `exit();` statement.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is listed alongside other vulnerabilities in Sphider (CVE-2014-5082, CVE-2014-5083, CVE-2014-5084, CVE-2014-5085, CVE-2014-5086, CVE-2014-5087) in the Exploit-DB entry. However, only CVE-2014-5081 is related to the authentication bypass.
*   The provided PoC uses `curl` to demonstrate the attack.
