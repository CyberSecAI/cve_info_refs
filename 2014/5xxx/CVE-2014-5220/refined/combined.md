The error is triggered by lines 90 and 91 of /usr/share/mdadm/mdcheck :          mdadm --detail --export "$dev" > $tmp || continue         source $tmp  Where "$tmp" in this case was set to "/var/lib/mdcheck/.md-check-29228" on line 68.  The value of MD_NAME includes characters that must be escaped to appear in a string.  In my case, it syntax errors on the parenthesis; in grant's case it tries to redirect stdin from a nonexistent file (it may also have created a file named ":nas03").  It looks like this bug makes it possible to execute arbitrary shell commands as root by including them in an MD_NAME, for example          MD_NAME=; rm -rf /  tosiara's error looks like a different problem.  I have mdadm-3.3.1-5.3.1.x86_64 on openSUSE 13.2 (Harlequin) (x86_64) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c6)  Forgotten User dBpEIsMMD7   2015-01-29 15:41:00 UTC  ``` > It looks like this bug makes it possible to execute arbitrary shell commands as > root by including them in an MD_NAME, for example >  >         MD_NAME=; rm -rf /  if true, cc'ing security-team ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c7)  Forgotten User rhqi2UUkSz   2015-02-01 21:29:15 UTC  ``` As a temporary workaround to get the cronjob to work until mdadm is patched, it should be enough to change the MD_NAME to something that doesn't need escaping.  Unfortunately, searching for ways to rename an md device only turns up ways to change the device node /dev/mdXXX.  Is there a way to change the MD_NAME? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c8)  Neil Brown   2015-02-01 22:17:05 UTC  ``` >  Is there a way to change the MD_NAME?

I have submitted an update for 13.2 and Factory which makes this change:  +-      mdadm --detail --export "$dev" > $tmp || continue ++      mdadm --detail --export "$dev" | grep '^MD_UUID=' > $tmp || continue  to the mdcheck script.  You could easily do that by hand rather than wait for the update.  [Comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c6) is correct that this could be a security issue. If a USB device with carefully crafted metadata were plugged into an openSUSE host, the array would be automatically assembled. If it was still there at 1am when the mdcheck script is run by cron, then shell code from the array name would be executed.  Security-team:  is there anything else I should do w.r.t. the security aspect? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-04 15:20:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil F Brown from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c10)) We probably will assign a CVE for that issue.  If you just need MD_UUID, why do you use this > $tmp, source approach? Your changed version should be safe but I don't see the need for that. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c12)  Marcus Meissner   2015-02-04 15:23:59 UTC  ``` Is this USB attack vector valid?

Well, one has to use some approach... The "--export" flag is intended to make it easy to extra detail for use by some other program, originally udev. It works, so I use it. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c14)  Neil Brown   2015-02-04 23:55:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c12)) > Is this USB attack vector valid? Can this really happen on just plugging in > a prepared USB stick?  Yes. If you plug in a USB which has been configured as the working device in a degraded RAID1, then udev will run "mdadm -I devicename" and the array will be activated.  This is not unlike the way a FAT filesystem will automatically be mounted.  Once the array has been assembled, /usr/share/mdadm/mdcheck will (at 1am) find it as a "/dev/md*" and will try to extra the UUID to decide what is to be done. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c15)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 10:15:45 UTC  ``` We will treat this as a security issue. I will assign a CVE shortly and start an update. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 10:24:15 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2014-5220 ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-02-05 10:24:59 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

When done, reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de. <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/60549> ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c18)  Forgotten User rhqi2UUkSz   2015-02-05 13:02:58 UTC  ``` Why is the problem that mdcheck doesn't validate input, rather than that mdadm doesn't escape its output?  The output sure looks like it's intended to be parsed by the shell; the man page says "output will be formatted as key=value pairs for easy import into the environment."  Does that refer to something other than the shell environment?  If the output from mdadm isn't changed, I would expect the same vulnerability to be recreated in future scripts, even if only site-specific scripts. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c19)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 13:20:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Shad Sterling from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c18)) It's not either or. One is a problem in a software we ship that could potentially be exploited. Because of that we assigned a CVE for that. Having mdadm properly quoting the output is certainly a good idea but could be considered a hardening (which wouldn't receive a CVE). I will file a bug to suggest that. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c20)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 13:22:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c19)) well, I just learned who the upstream maintainer is ... ;) Neil, what do you think? ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c21)  Neil Brown   2015-02-05 20:44:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c20)) > well, I just learned who the upstream maintainer is ... ;) Neil, what do you > think?  It is already on my list of things I should think about fixing in mdadm.  In answer to:  > Does that refer to something other than the shell environment?   It originally referred to the udev environment.  I would like it to work for shell too. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c22)  Neil Brown   2015-02-06 05:17:37 UTC  ``` I'm not sure how best to reply to a 'swamp' email... so I'll reply here.  This bug is only relevant to openSUSE-13.2, and openSUSE:Factory.  No other release containst mdcheck.  In particularly, no SLES release contains this.  The 'swamp' issue identifies two other bugs that should be address.  Neither of these are relevant to either of the affected releases - they already contain the fix.  These two are only relevant to SLES11-SP3, and possibly -SP2.  So there is only one bug that needs to be fixed for openSUSE. The maint request for 13.2 is 284268.

The error is triggered by lines 90 and 91 of /usr/share/mdadm/mdcheck :          mdadm --detail --export "$dev" > $tmp || continue         source $tmp  Where "$tmp" in this case was set to "/var/lib/mdcheck/.md-check-29228" on line 68.  The value of MD_NAME includes characters that must be escaped to appear in a string.  In my case, it syntax errors on the parenthesis; in grant's case it tries to redirect stdin from a nonexistent file (it may also have created a file named ":nas03").  It looks like this bug makes it possible to execute arbitrary shell commands as root by including them in an MD_NAME, for example          MD_NAME=; rm -rf /  tosiara's error looks like a different problem.  I have mdadm-3.3.1-5.3.1.x86_64 on openSUSE 13.2 (Harlequin) (x86_64) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c6)  Forgotten User dBpEIsMMD7   2015-01-29 15:41:00 UTC  ``` > It looks like this bug makes it possible to execute arbitrary shell commands as > root by including them in an MD_NAME, for example >  >         MD_NAME=; rm -rf /  if true, cc'ing security-team ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c7)  Forgotten User rhqi2UUkSz   2015-02-01 21:29:15 UTC  ``` As a temporary workaround to get the cronjob to work until mdadm is patched, it should be enough to change the MD_NAME to something that doesn't need escaping.  Unfortunately, searching for ways to rename an md device only turns up ways to change the device node /dev/mdXXX.  Is there a way to change the MD_NAME? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c8)  Neil Brown   2015-02-01 22:17:05 UTC  ``` >  Is there a way to change the MD_NAME?

I have submitted an update for 13.2 and Factory which makes this change:  +-      mdadm --detail --export "$dev" > $tmp || continue ++      mdadm --detail --export "$dev" | grep '^MD_UUID=' > $tmp || continue  to the mdcheck script.  You could easily do that by hand rather than wait for the update.  [Comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c6) is correct that this could be a security issue. If a USB device with carefully crafted metadata were plugged into an openSUSE host, the array would be automatically assembled. If it was still there at 1am when the mdcheck script is run by cron, then shell code from the array name would be executed.  Security-team:  is there anything else I should do w.r.t. the security aspect? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-04 15:20:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil F Brown from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c10)) We probably will assign a CVE for that issue.  If you just need MD_UUID, why do you use this > $tmp, source approach? Your changed version should be safe but I don't see the need for that. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c12)  Marcus Meissner   2015-02-04 15:23:59 UTC  ``` Is this USB attack vector valid? Can this really happen on just plugging in a prepared USB stick? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c13)  Neil Brown   2015-02-04 23:49:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c11))  > If you just need MD_UUID, why do you use this > $tmp, source approach?   Well, one has to use some approach... The "--export" flag is intended to make it easy to extra detail for use by some other program, originally udev. It works, so I use it. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c14)  Neil Brown   2015-02-04 23:55:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c12)) > Is this USB attack vector valid? Can this really happen on just plugging in > a prepared USB stick?  Yes. If you plug in a USB which has been configured as the working device in a degraded RAID1, then udev will run "mdadm -I devicename" and the array will be activated.  This is not unlike the way a FAT filesystem will automatically be mounted.  Once the array has been assembled, /usr/share/mdadm/mdcheck will (at 1am) find it as a "/dev/md*" and will try to extra the UUID to decide what is to be done. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c15)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 10:15:45 UTC  ``` We will treat this as a security issue. I will assign a CVE shortly and start an update. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 10:24:15 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2014-5220 ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-02-05 10:24:59 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started. This issue was rated as low. Please submit fixed packages until 2015-03-05. When done, reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de. <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/60549> ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c18)  Forgotten User rhqi2UUkSz   2015-02-05 13:02:58 UTC  ``` Why is the problem that mdcheck doesn't validate input, rather than that mdadm doesn't escape its output?  The output sure looks like it's intended to be parsed by the shell; the man page says "output will be formatted as key=value pairs for easy import into the environment."  Does that refer to something other than the shell environment?  If the output from mdadm isn't changed, I would expect the same vulnerability to be recreated in future scripts, even if only site-specific scripts. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c19)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 13:20:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Shad Sterling from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c18)) It's not either or. One is a problem in a software we ship that could potentially be exploited. Because of that we assigned a CVE for that. Having mdadm properly quoting the output is certainly a good idea but could be considered a hardening (which wouldn't receive a CVE). I will file a bug to suggest that. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c20)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-05 13:22:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c19)) well, I just learned who the upstream maintainer is ... ;) Neil, what do you think? ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c21)  Neil Brown   2015-02-05 20:44:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c20)) > well, I just learned who the upstream maintainer is ... ;) Neil, what do you > think?  It is already on my list of things I should think about fixing in mdadm.  In answer to:  > Does that refer to something other than the shell environment?   It originally referred to the udev environment.  I would like it to work for shell too. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c22)  Neil Brown   2015-02-06 05:17:37 UTC  ``` I'm not sure how best to reply to a 'swamp' email... so I'll reply here.  This bug is only relevant to openSUSE-13.2, and openSUSE:Factory.  No other release containst mdcheck.  In particularly, no SLES release contains this.  The 'swamp' issue identifies two other bugs that should be address.  Neither of these are relevant to either of the affected releases - they already contain the fix.  These two are only relevant to SLES11-SP3, and possibly -SP2.  So there is only one bug that needs to be fixed for openSUSE. The maint request for 13.2 is 284268. The request for Factory is 283972. ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c23)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-02-06 06:00:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (910500) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284268> 13.2 / mdadm ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c24)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-06 08:52:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil F Brown from [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=910500#c22)) Sorry, didn't know that.

I have submitted a patch to openSUSE13.2 to remove that restriction and have queued it to go upstream. So it should be fixed in next maintenance kernel, or the kernel-of-the-day in a couple of days.  Thanks for the report. ``` |  |
