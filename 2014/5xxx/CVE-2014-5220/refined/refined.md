Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5220:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `mdcheck` script using `mdadm --detail --export` and then sourcing the output as a shell script. The output of `mdadm --detail --export` is not properly sanitized/escaped, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shell commands via the `MD_NAME` field of the exported data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because the output of `mdadm --detail --export` is interpreted as shell commands, a malicious actor can embed arbitrary code within the `MD_NAME` field which will then be executed by the `mdcheck` script when it uses `source $tmp`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `mdcheck` script fails to validate or sanitize the output of the `mdadm` command before executing it, which leads to the command injection vulnerability.
*   **Unsafe Script Execution:** The script executes the output of an external command (`mdadm`) without proper checks or sanitization by using the `source` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary shell commands with root privileges. This can have a wide range of impacts, including:
    *   System compromise
    *   Data theft or modification
    *   Denial of service
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain root access by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted RAID Metadata:** An attacker can create a RAID array with a specially crafted `MD_NAME` containing malicious shell commands.
*   **USB Attack:**  A USB device containing the crafted RAID metadata can be plugged into a vulnerable system. The system's `udev` daemon would automatically assemble the array and, when the `mdcheck` script runs via cron, the malicious commands would be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create RAID metadata:** The attacker must be able to create or modify the metadata of a RAID array.
*   **Physical Access or Ability to Mount RAID Array:** The attacker needs physical access to plug in a USB with malicious metadata or another way to mount the crafted array.
*   **Vulnerable System:** The target system must be running a vulnerable version of `mdadm` and the `mdcheck` script (specifically openSUSE 13.2 and Factory).

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was present in the `mdcheck` script which is not part of the `mdadm` package itself, but is included in openSUSE distributions.
* The initial fix involved filtering the output of `mdadm --detail --export` to only extract the `MD_UUID`, instead of sourcing the entire output.
* There is a secondary issue where the value written to `/sys/dev/block/<device>/md/sync_min` in the `mdcheck` script is not validated and can cause write errors if it's not chunk aligned. This issue is addressed in a later kernel patch.
