{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly validates SSL chain",
       "Failure to verify that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
      "Exploitation via insecure public WiFi"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the applications' failure to properly validate the SSL chain, which leaves them susceptible to MITM attacks. The document also includes a link to a spreadsheet which contains a list of the affected applications and libraries."
