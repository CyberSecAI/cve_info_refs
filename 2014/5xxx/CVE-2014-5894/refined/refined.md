  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates during SSL/TLS communication (CWE-295, CWE-296)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible if the attacker is on the same network as the Android device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to perform a MITM attack."
