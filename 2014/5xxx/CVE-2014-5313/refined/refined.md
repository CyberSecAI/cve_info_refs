Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in how Movable Type processes the management page.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) present in Movable Type's management page processing.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Execution of arbitrary scripts in the administrator's web browser.
    *   Display of false forms on the administrator's web browser. This could potentially lead to further attacks like phishing or session hijacking if an attacker were able to exploit this vulnerability effectively.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the vulnerable processing of the management page.

*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Movable Type instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability (single instance authentication). This suggests the attack requires a legitimate user to be targeted.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Movable Type versions 5.14 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Movable Type version 5.2.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 4.0 (Medium), indicating a moderate severity. The metrics include:
    *   Access Vector: Network
    *   Access Complexity: Low
    *   Authentication: Single Instance
    *   Confidentiality Impact: None
    *   Integrity Impact: Partial
    *   Availability Impact: None
