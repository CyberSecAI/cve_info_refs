{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This occurs because the applications do not properly verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly validating SSL certificates",
      "Failure to verify the SSL chain against a trusted root CA."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
      "Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation by intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's Android device to intercept network traffic. No other special position or capabilities are explicitly mentioned but being able to act as a rogue access point or a compromised router could facilitate the MITM attack."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability note VU#582497 provides more detail than the CVE description. It specifies that multiple applications are affected, provides a methodology for testing with CERT Tapioca, and cites real-world examples where such vulnerabilities have led to regulatory action by the Federal Trade Commission against companies like Fandango and Credit Karma."
