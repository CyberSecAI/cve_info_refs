Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of **hard-coded cryptographic keys** within the Hospira MedNet software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321):** The software uses cryptographic keys embedded directly within the code. This means the keys are not randomly generated, making them discoverable to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could **intercept encrypted traffic** from the infusion pumps.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data being transmitted between the pumps and the MedNet server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **network-based**. An attacker can intercept the network traffic and use the hard-coded keys to decrypt the communications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires **network access** to the MedNet server and the communication channel between the server and infusion pumps.
*   The attacker needs **low skill** level to perform the attack.
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated on the network (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 has been assigned. The vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N).
*   Hospira has released MedNet 6.1, which addresses this vulnerability by removing the hardcoded keys.
