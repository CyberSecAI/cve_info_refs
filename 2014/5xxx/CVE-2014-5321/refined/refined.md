Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of FileMaker Pro to properly verify SSL server certificates when establishing encrypted communication with a FileMaker Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The software does not correctly validate the SSL server certificate presented during the TLS handshake. This likely involves not verifying the certificate chain, expiration date, or hostname.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the FileMaker Pro client and the FileMaker Server can intercept the encrypted communication.
*   **Eavesdropping:** By intercepting and decrypting the communication, the attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted. This could include database credentials, personal information, or other proprietary data.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** A successful MitM can potentially modify data transmitted between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack occurs over the network, requiring the attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a FileMaker Pro client and a FileMaker Server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and potentially modify network traffic, typically by being on the same network or compromising network infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the communication path between the client and server.
*   **MitM Capability:** The attacker needs the capability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which involves intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the FileMaker server

**Additional Information**
* FileMaker Pro versions 12 and earlier, as well as FileMaker Pro Advanced versions 12 and earlier, are affected.
* The vulnerability has been addressed in FileMaker Pro 13 and FileMaker Pro Advanced 13.
* The vulnerability is categorized as "No Mapping (CWE-Other)" by the IPA, indicating it's not directly classified within the standard CWE hierarchy.
* The severity is rated as medium, with a CVSS v2 score of 4.0.
