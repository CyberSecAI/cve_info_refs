Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE Number :", however, there is no CVE assigned for it. The Codevigilant content identifies the vulnerability as "Injection" within the "hdw-player-video-player-video-gallery" WordPress plugin, and provides a SQL injection vector. The provided Trac changeset log shows modifications to the plugin files, including sanitization of the 'id' parameter in config.php, suggesting a vulnerability fix. Therefore, the content appears relevant and related to a SQL injection vulnerability in the mentioned plugin.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter when querying the database in the `hdw-player-video-player-video-gallery` plugin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The plugin was vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter. Specifically, the following code snippet was vulnerable:
    ```php
    $player = $wpdb->get_row ( "SELECT * FROM " . $wpdb->prefix . "hdwplayer WHERE id=" . $_POST ['id'] );
    ```
    This code directly uses the value of `$_POST['id']` in the SQL query without sanitization, making the plugin vulnerable to SQL Injection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other private information.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain administrative access to the WordPress site.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `admin.php` page of the WordPress site via an HTTP request.
    *   The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter located in `http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=videos&opt=edit&id=2`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires at least administrator-level access to the WordPress admin panel to exploit this vulnerability via the `videos` page.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content from codevigilant.com is more specific with technical details than what is present in the wordpress.org trac log
*   The Trac changeset details show that the vulnerability was addressed by using `intval()` function to sanitize the `id` parameter in the `config.php`, `hdwplayer/__add.php`, `hdwplayer/__edit.php`, `shortcode.php`, and `/videos/__edit.php` files.
*   The exploit vector provided `http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=videos&opt=edit&id=2 union select 1,2,user(),4,5,6,database(),8,@@version,10,11,12` demonstrates a typical SQL injection attempt to extract database information.
*   The `email.php` file was deleted in the update, suggesting it might have been another entry point or source of vulnerability, although this is not explicitly stated.
*   The codevigilant.com entry provides a disclosure timeline with the vendor being contacted in December 2013 and a patch being applied in April 2014, with public disclosure in May 2014.
