Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a PHP file (`content.php`) within the WordPress Mobile Pack plugin that inappropriately exposes content. This file lacks proper access controls, allowing anyone to bypass password protection mechanisms intended for posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the unauthorized access to password-protected content.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The `content.php` file does not enforce proper authentication or authorization checks, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerable file can be directly accessed via URL by any user without authentication

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read the content of password-protected posts, which may contain sensitive or private information.
- **Exposure of Unpublished Content:** While draft and private posts are noted as not affected, the disclosure of protected content still presents a significant risk.
- **Unintended access:** Public access to the information that was intended to be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is executed over the network through a simple HTTP request to the vulnerable `content.php` file.
- **Direct URL Access:** The attacker directly requests the vulnerable file path `http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/export/content.php?content=exportarticles&callback=x`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any prior access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know or discover the file path to the vulnerable `content.php` file in the WordPress Mobile Pack plugin

**Additional Details:**

*   The output is returned as JSON wrapped within a function call `x()`.
*   The vulnerability is present in WordPress Mobile Pack version 2.0.1.
*   The issue is fixed in version 2.0.2 and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2014-07-24 and reported to the developer on 2014-07-13

This vulnerability is a significant concern because it allows unauthorized users to access content that was specifically intended to be protected, potentially exposing sensitive or confidential information.
