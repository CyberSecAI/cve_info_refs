{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mkxmltype` and `mkdtskel` scripts in `libxml-dt-perl` use insecure temporary file creation. They use a fixed filename `/tmp/_xml_$$` where `$$` is the process ID. This allows for symlink attacks where an attacker can create a symlink to an arbitrary file, causing the script to overwrite that file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure temporary file creation",
    "Symlink vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file overwrite. A local attacker can truncate any file the user running the script has write access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local symlink attack",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp` and execute the vulnerable scripts."
