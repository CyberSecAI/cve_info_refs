The content is related to CVE-2014-5418.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
1.  **Hard-coded RSA Private Key:** The RSA private key used for decrypting SSL traffic is embedded within the firmware.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS) via web interface:** A targeted attack on the web-based management interface can lead to slow or interrupted communications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Exposure of RSA Private Key:** The presence of a static, hard-coded RSA private key in the firmware allows unauthorized parties to decrypt SSL traffic, compromising confidentiality.
2.  **DoS Vulnerability:** The web interface is vulnerable to attacks that can lead to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **RSA Private Key Exposure:**
    -   Compromised confidentiality of SSL encrypted traffic.
    -   Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonation
2.  **DoS:**
    -   Disruption or interruption of management interface
    -   Impairment of switch configuration via web interface

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **RSA Private Key:**
    -   The attacker needs access to the firmware file to extract the key.
    -   The firmware may be accessible on the network, or could be obtained through a vulnerability in another system that has access to the firmware update.
2.  **DoS:**
    -   Attack on the web interface, likely by sending malformed requests or overwhelming the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **RSA Private Key:**
    -   Ability to obtain the switch firmware.
2.  **DoS:**
    -   Network access to the web interface of the switch.

**Mitigation:**
1.  **Hard-Coded RSA Private Key:** Update the firmware to versions 5.3.0 (for ML800, ML1200, ML1600 and ML2400) or 5.3.0.3k (for ML810, ML3000 and ML3100) which allows for the generation of new keys and exchange.
2.  **DoS:** Disable the web server through the command-line interface. Configure device through serial connection or Telnet and not web interface.
