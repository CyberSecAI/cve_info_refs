RSA Private Key & DoS Vulnerabilty

ML800/1200/1600/2400
ML810/3000/3100
Date:
January 21, 2015

Classification:   General

Product Bulletin

ICS-CERT Advisory: ICSA-15-013-04

Overview

Two vulnerabilities were identified in GE MultiLink ML800 series managed switches, which, if successfully exploited,
could  result  in  unauthorized  access  and  denial  of  service.  GE  Digital  Energy  has  validated  these  vulnerabilities
through  testing  and  confirms  that  the  issues  affecting  the  ML800  will  also  affect  the  MultiLink  series  of  managed
Ethernet switches including the ML1200, ML1600, ML2400, ML810, ML3000, and ML3100.  These vulnerabilities have
been publicly disclosed.

There are no known public exploits of MultiLink ML800.

This product bulletin discusses the vulnerabilities and provides recommended mitigations.

Background

The  MultiLink  ML800  is  a  compact,  hardened  Managed  Ethernet  Switch  that  provides  high-speed  networking  of
critical applications, and has been specifically designed for use in industrial facilities, substations and transportation
environments.

Researcher  Eireann  Leverett  identified  two  vulnerabilities  associated  with  the  MultiLink  ML800  switch  and
coordinated  his  findings  with  GE,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Industrial  Control  System  –  Cyber
Emergency  Response  Team  (ICS-CERT)  and  the  UK-CERT.      GE  has  identified  mitigation  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  of
these vulnerabilities (discussed below) and we are working with our OEM partner to provide a firmware upgrade to
address both of these vulnerabilities.

More  recently,  Mr.  Leverett  identified  a  third  attack  vector,  which  GE  is  investigating  with  his  assistance.    GE  is
working to validate that issue and we will provide additional information if and when any vulnerability is confirmed.

Vulnerability Overview

The  two  confirmed  vulnerabilities  are:  1)  the  RSA  private  key  used  to  decrypt  SSL  traffic  is  obtainable  from  the
firmware  and  2)  the  potential  for  a  targeted  attack  on  a  specific  management  interface  resulting  in  sluggish  or
interrupted (DoS – Denial of Service) communications.

Impact to individual customers depends on many factors that are unique to each customer. GE recommends that
customers  evaluate  the  impact  of  this  vulnerability  based  on  their  operational  environment,  architecture,  and
product implementation,  and implement the following mitigation measures as appropriate.

Mitigation

Mitigation steps that can be taken immediately

Hard-Coded RSA Private Key

GE encourages our customers to update the switch firmware to the latest published version to enable new keys to
be calculated and exchanged. The latest firmware is version5.3.0 for the ML800, ML1200, ML1600 and ML2400 and
version 5.3.0.3k for the ML810, ML3000, and ML3100. This firmware is available through the “Resources / Software”
link in the product websites (see Appendix A to this Bulletin for a complete list of links).  This firmware is also available
through the EnerVista Launchpad device management tool. The directions to calculate and exchange keys are in the
following  table,  which  will  be  added  to  the  instruction  manuals  for  the  impacted  MultiLink  switches.    It  is
recommended  that  the  user  perform  the  key  exchange  over  a  serial  connection  to  prevent  a  third  party  from
capturing the new key.

  To upload a custom key/certificate, a user could use the several
available file transfer options via CLI (ie: ftp, tftp, xmodem)
  Syntax:  ftp get type=cert [ip=<ipaddress>] [file=< cert filename>]
  The key file format used in the MultiLink products is .pem
  The new key/certificate will permanently overwrite the old
key/certificate and it is sustainable through power cycling

Slow data transfer or DoS

This DoS affects the web interface used to configure the device with a web browser.  It is recommended that when
deploying the device into a production environment that the web server be disabled in order to effectively mitigate
this vulnerability.  After disabling the web interface a user remains able to configure the device locally or remotely
through the command line interfaces without risk of exploitation.

By connecting to the command line interface through either a serial connection or through telnet it is possible to
disable the web server with the following commands:

ML800# access

ML800(access)## web disable

This change may be verified by using the show web command:

ML800(access)## show web

  HTTP is disabled.

Save the configuration to maintain this new setting.

General mitigation measures

GE recommends its customers implement network security defensive measures to minimize risk of their network
being compromised, including:

  Minimize network exposure to all other control system devices.  Control system devices should not be

connected directly to the internet.

  Locate control system network(s) and devices behind properly configured firewalls, and isolate them from the

business network.

  Utilize detection methods to monitor for anomalous network traffic that is “out of band” and not expected.



If remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) recognizing
that the VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

Future Firmware Upgrade from GE

GE has worked with its OEM partner to develop a new firmware version that removes the hard-coded RSA private
key, and that provides a fix to the web server. This firmware version is going through production testing and
verification. When available, the upgraded firmware will be released through the GE Digital Energy website and the
EnerVista Launchpad tool. Instruction manuals for the MultiLink switches will be updated and released through the
website and EnerVista Launchpad.

Acknowledgements

GE would like to thank Eireann Leverett for reporting these issues to GE, ICS-CERT and UK-CERT, assisting GE in its
investigation, and helping to protect GE customers.
