| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 10:58:51 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way reference counting was handled in the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem when unmount on symlink was performed.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 an unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (also in a container) could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:12:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  Future Linux kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c2)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:13:38 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream patch:    <https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/21/98>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:21:09 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1122482](show_bug.cgi?id=1122482 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5045 kernel: vfs: refcount issues during lazy unmount on symlink [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c5)  Vasily Averin    2014-07-24 05:57:45 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-5045](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5045) was assigned for this issue   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-10-10 08:46:18 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation

handled malformed or duplicate Address Configuration Change Chunks
(ASCONF). A remote attacker could use either of these flaws to crash the
system. (CVE-2014-3673, CVE-2014-3687, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation

handled the association's output queue. A remote attacker could send
specially crafted packets that would cause the system to use an excessive
amount of memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3688,
Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled

reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to exhaust all available
memory on the system or, potentially, trigger a use-after-free error,
resulting in a system crash or privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-5045,
Moderate)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo1x\_decompress\_safe()

function of the Linux kernel's LZO implementation processed Literal Runs.
A local attacker could, in extremely rare cases, use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-4608, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting
CVE-2014-5045, and Don A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security for reporting
CVE-2014-4608. The CVE-2014-3673 issue was discovered by Liu Wei of
Red Hat.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
Documentation for these changes is available from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References section.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

platform\_get\_irq: Revert to platform\_get\_resource if of\_irq\_get fails
commit aff008ad813c7cf3cfe7b532e7ba2c526c136f22 upstream.
Commits 9ec36ca (of/irq: do irq resolution in platform\_get\_irq)
and ad69674 (of/irq: do irq resolution in platform\_get\_irq\_byname)
change the semantics of platform\_get\_irq and platform\_get\_irq\_byname
to always rely on devicetree information if devicetree is enabled
and if a devicetree node is attached to the device. The functions
now return an error if the devicetree data does not include interrupt
information, even if the information is available as platform resource
data.
This causes mfd client drivers to fail if the interrupt number is
passed via platform resources. Therefore, if of\_irq\_get fails, try
platform\_get\_resource as method of last resort. This restores the
original functionality for drivers depending on platform resources
to get irq information.

mm: do not call do\_fault\_around for non-linear fault
commit c118678bc79e8241f9d3434d9324c6400d72f48a upstream.
Ingo Korb reported that "repeated mapping of the same file on tmpfs
using remap\_file\_pages sometimes triggers a BUG at mm/filemap.c:202 when
the process exits".
He bisected the bug to d7c1755179b8 ("mm: implement ->map\_pages for
shmem/tmpfs"), although the bug was actually added by commit
8c6e50b0290c ("mm: introduce vm\_ops->map\_pages()").
The problem is caused by calling do\_fault\_around for a \_non-linear\_
fault. In this case pgoff is shifted and might become negative during
calculation.
Faulting around non-linear page-fault makes no sense and breaks the
logic in do\_fault\_around because pgoff is shifted.

hwrng: virtio - ensure reads happen after successful probe
commit e052dbf554610e2104c5a7518c4d8374bed701bb upstream.
The hwrng core asks for random data in the hwrng\_register() call itself
from commit d9e7972619. This doesn't play well with virtio -- the
DRIVER\_OK bit is only set by virtio core on a successful probe, and
we're not yet out of our probe routine when this call is made. This
causes the host to not acknowledge any requests we put in the virtqueue,
and the insmod or kernel boot process just waits for data to arrive from
the host, which never happens.

Fix gcc-4.9.0 miscompilation of load\_balance() in scheduler
commit 2062afb4f804afef61cbe62a30cac9a46e58e067 upstream.
Michel Dänzer and a couple of other people reported inexplicable random
oopses in the scheduler, and the cause turns out to be gcc mis-compiling
the load\_balance() function when debugging is enabled. The gcc bug
apparently goes back to gcc-4.5, but slight optimization changes means
that it now showed up as a problem in 4.9.0 and 4.9.1.
The instruction scheduling problem causes gcc to schedule a spill
operation to before the stack frame has been created, which in turn can
corrupt the spilled value if an interrupt comes in. There may be other
effects of this bug too, but that's the code generation problem seen in
Michel's case.
This is fixed in current gcc HEAD, but the workaround as suggested by
Markus Trippelsdorf is pretty simple: use -fno-var-tracking-assignments
when compiling the kernel, which disables the gcc code that causes the
problem. This can result in slightly worse debug information for
variable accesses, but that is infinitely preferable to actual code
generation problems.
Doing this unconditionally (not just for CONFIG\_DEBUG\_INFO) also allows
non-debug builds to verify that the debug build would be identical: we
can do
export GCC\_COMPARE\_DEBUG=1
to make gcc internally verify that the result of the build is
independent of the "-g" flag (it will make the compiler build everything
twice, toggling the debug flag, and compare the results).
Without the "-fno-var-tracking-assignments" option, the build would fail
(even with 4.8.3 that didn't show the actual stack frame bug) with a gcc
compare failure.

mm: hugetlb: fix copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range()
commit 0253d634e0803a8376a0d88efee0bf523d8673f9 upstream.
Commit 4a705fef9862 ("hugetlb: fix copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range() to handle
migration/hwpoisoned entry") changed the order of
huge\_ptep\_set\_wrprotect() and huge\_ptep\_get(), which leads to breakage
in some workloads like hugepage-backed heap allocation via libhugetlbfs.
This patch fixes it.
The test program for the problem is shown below:
$ cat heap.c
#include
#include
#include
#define HPS 0x200000
int main() {
int i;
char \*p = malloc(HPS);
memset(p, '1', HPS);
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
if (!fork()) {
memset(p, '2', HPS);
p = malloc(HPS);
memset(p, '3', HPS);
free(p);
return 0;
}
}
sleep(1);
free(p);
return 0;
}
$ export HUGETLB\_MORECORE=yes ; export HUGETLB\_NO\_PREFAULT= ; hugectl --heap ./heap
Fixes 4a705fef9862 ("hugetlb: fix copy\_hugetlb\_page\_range() to handle

x86\_32, entry: Store badsys error code in %eax
commit 8142b215501f8b291a108a202b3a053a265b03dd upstream.
Commit 554086d ("x86\_32, entry: Do syscall exit work on badsys
(CVE-2014-4508)") introduced a regression in the x86\_32 syscall entry
code, resulting in syscall() not returning proper errors for undefined
syscalls on CPUs supporting the sysenter feature.
The following code:
> int result = syscall(666);
> printf("result=%d errno=%d error=%s\n", result, errno, strerror(errno));
results in:
> result=666 errno=0 error=Success
Obviously, the syscall return value is the called syscall number, but it
should have been an ENOSYS error. When run under ptrace it behaves
correctly, which makes it hard to debug in the wild:
> result=-1 errno=38 error=Function not implemented
The %eax register is the return value register. For debugging via ptrace
the syscall entry code stores the complete register context on the
stack. The badsys handlers only store the ENOSYS error code in the
ptrace register set and do not set %eax like a regular syscall handler
would. The old resume\_userspace call chain contains code that clobbers
%eax and it restores %eax from the ptrace registers afterwards. The same
goes for the ptrace-enabled call chain. When ptrace is not used, the
syscall return value is the passed-in syscall number from the untouched
%eax register.
Use %eax as the return value register in syscall\_badsys and
sysenter\_badsys, like a real syscall handler does, and have the caller
push the value onto the stack for ptrace access.

pinctrl: st: Fix irqmux handler
commit 7a2deccf0ef12f7f6e33150d5875020c0c94fa94 upstream.
st\_gpio\_irqmux\_handler() reads the status register to find out
which banks inside the controller have pending IRQs.
For each banks having pending IRQs, it calls the corresponding handler.
Problem is that current code restricts the number of possible banks inside the
controller to ST\_GPIO\_PINS\_PER\_BANK. This define represents the number of pins
inside a bank, so it shouldn't be used here.
On STiH407, PIO\_FRONT0 controller has 10 banks, so IRQs pending in the two
last banks (PIO18 & PIO19) aren't handled.
This patch replace ST\_GPIO\_PINS\_PER\_BANK by the number of banks inside the
controller.

slab\_common: fix the check for duplicate slab names
commit 694617474e33b8603fc76e090ed7d09376514b1a upstream.
The patch 3e374919b314f20e2a04f641ebc1093d758f66a4 is supposed to fix the
problem where kmem\_cache\_create incorrectly reports duplicate cache name
and fails. The problem is described in the header of that patch.
However, the patch doesn't really fix the problem because of these
reasons:
\* the logic to test for debugging is reversed. It was intended to perform
the check only if slub debugging is enabled (which implies that caches
with the same parameters are not merged). Therefore, there should be
#if !defined(CONFIG\_SLUB) || defined(CONFIG\_SLUB\_DEBUG\_ON)
The current code has the condition reversed and performs the test if
debugging is disabled.
\* slub debugging may be enabled or disabled based on kernel command line,
CONFIG\_SLUB\_DEBUG\_ON is just the default settings. Therefore the test
based on definition of CONFIG\_SLUB\_DEBUG\_ON is unreliable.
This patch fixes the problem by removing the test
"!defined(CONFIG\_SLUB\_DEBUG\_ON)". Therefore, duplicate names are never
checked if the SLUB allocator is used.
Note to stable kernel maintainers: when backporint this patch, please
backport also the patch 3e374919b314f20e2a04f641ebc1093d758f66a4.

powerpc/pseries: dynamically added OF nodes need to call of\_node\_init
commit 97a9a7179aad701ab676e6f29eb90766a1acfde2 upstream.
Commit 75b57ecf9 refactored device tree nodes to use kobjects such that they
can be exposed via /sysfs. A secondary commit 0829f6d1f furthered this rework
by moving the kobect initialization logic out of of\_node\_add into its own
of\_node\_init function. The inital commit removed the existing kref\_init calls
in the pseries dlpar code with the assumption kobject initialization would
occur in of\_node\_add. The second commit had the side effect of triggering a
BUG\_ON during DLPAR, migration and suspend/resume operations as a result of
dynamically added nodes being uninitialized.
This patch fixes this by adding of\_node\_init calls in place of the previously
removed kref\_init calls.

(u64)jiffies\_to\_usecs(jiffy) \* 1000ULL
but since jiffies\_to\_usecs() only returns a 32-bit value, it
truncates at 2^32 microseconds. An additional problem on 32-bit
systems is that the argument is "unsigned long", so fixing the
return value only helps until 2^32 jiffies (49.7 days on a HZ=1000
system).
Avoid these problems by using jiffies\_64 as our basis, and
not converting to nanoseconds (we do convert to clock\_t because
user facing API must not be dependent on internal kernel
HZ values).

blkcg: don't call into policy draining if root\_blkg is already gone

776687bce42b ("block, blk-mq: draining can't be skipped even if
bypass\_depth was non-zero") made it easier to trigger this bug by
making blk\_queue\_bypass\_start() drain even when it loses the first
bypass test to blk\_cleanup\_queue(); however, the bug has always been
there even before the commit as blk\_queue\_bypass\_start() could race
against queue destruction, win the initial bypass test but perform the
actual draining after blk\_cleanup\_queue() already destroyed all blkgs.
Fix it by skippping calling into policy draining if all the blkgs are
already gone.

The PSW mask check of the PTRACE\_POKEUSR\_AREA command is incorrect.
The PSW\_MASK\_USER define contains the PSW\_MASK\_ASC bits, the ptrace
interface accepts all combinations for the address-space-control

to reject the address-space-control bit combination for home space.

Fix it by introducing ata\_host->n\_tags which is initialized to
ATA\_MAX\_QUEUE - 1 in ata\_host\_init() for SAS controllers and set to
scsi\_host\_template->can\_queue in ata\_host\_register() for !SAS ones.
As SAS hosts are never registered, this will give them the same
ATA\_MAX\_QUEUE - 1 as before. Note that we can't use
scsi\_host->can\_queue directly for SAS hosts anyway as they can go
higher than the libata maximum.

libata: support the ata host which implements a queue depth less than 32
commit 1871ee134b73fb4cadab75752a7152ed2813c751 upstream.
The sata on fsl mpc8315e is broken after the commit 8a4aeec8d2d6
("libata/ahci: accommodate tag ordered controllers"). The reason is
that the ata controller on this SoC only implement a queue depth of
16. When issuing the commands in tag order, all the commands in tag
16 ~ 31 are mapped to tag 0 unconditionally and then causes the sata
malfunction. It makes no senses to use a 32 queue in software while
the hardware has less queue depth. So consider the queue depth
implemented by the hardware when requesting a command tag.

the one for the Scsi\_Host, as device model objects can be held for

media: hdpvr: fix two audio bugs
commit 3445857b22eafb70a6ac258979e955b116bfd2c6 upstream.
When the audio encoding is changed the driver calls hdpvr\_set\_audio
with the current opt->audio\_input value. However, that should have
been opt->audio\_input + 1. So changing the audio encoding inadvertently
changes the input as well. This bug has always been there.
The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and that broke the
default\_audio\_input module option handling: the audio encoding was
never switched to AC3 if default\_audio\_input was set to 2 (SPDIF input).
In addition, since starting with 3.10 the audio encoding is always set
at the start the first bug now always happens when the driver is loaded.
In the past this bug would only surface if the user would change the
audio encoding after the driver was loaded.
Also fixes a small trivial typo (bufffer -> buffer).

media: staging: tighten omap4iss dependencies
commit 4856fbd12d69965d3ab680c686222db93872728d upstream.
The OMAP4 camera support depends on I2C and VIDEO\_V4L2, both
of which can be loadable modules. This causes build failures
if we want the camera driver to be built-in.
This can be solved by turning the option into "tristate",
which unfortunately causes another problem, because the
driver incorrectly calls a platform-internal interface
for omap4\_ctrl\_pad\_readl/omap4\_ctrl\_pad\_writel.
Instead, this patch just forbids the invalid configurations
and ensures that the driver can only be built if all its
dependencies are built-in.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 10:58:51 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way reference counting was handled in the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem when unmount on symlink was performed.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 an unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (also in a container) could use this flaw to cause OOM conditions leading to denial of service or, potentially, trigger use-after-free error.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:12:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  Future Linux kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c2)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:13:38 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream patch:    <https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/21/98>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-07-23 11:21:09 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1122482](show_bug.cgi?id=1122482 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5045 kernel: vfs: refcount issues during lazy unmount on symlink [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c5)  Vasily Averin    2014-07-24 05:57:45 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-5045](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5045) was assigned for this issue   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1122472#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-10-10 08:46:18 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.

fs: umount on symlink leaks mnt count

```
Currently umount on symlink blocks following umount:

/vz is separate mount

# ls /vz/ -al | grep test
drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root       4096 Jul 19 01:14 testdir
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 root root         11 Jul 19 01:16 testlink -> /vz/testdir
# umount -l /vz/testlink
umount: /vz/testlink: not mounted (expected)

# lsof /vz
# umount /vz
umount: /vz: device is busy. (unexpected)

In this case mountpoint_last() gets an extra refcount on path->mnt

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
