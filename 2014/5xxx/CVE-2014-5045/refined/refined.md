{
  "CVE-2014-5045": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect reference counting in the VFS subsystem during unmount operations on symbolic links.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect reference counting"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system or, potentially, trigger a use-after-free error, resulting in a system crash or privilege escalation.",
       "Attack vectors": [
      "Local Access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Unprivileged local user access to trigger unmount operations on a symlink. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (or within a container) is required.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition resulting in a denial of service or a use-after-free error that can cause a system crash. It exists in the `mountpoint_last` function in `fs/namei.c`."
