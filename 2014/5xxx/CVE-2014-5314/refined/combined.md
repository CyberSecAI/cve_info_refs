[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface). |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. |

Base Score:9.0
