Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-5417

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web interface of Meinberg LANTIME products, specifically the M-Series, does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web interface is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to improper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a LANTIME system's web interface.
- If an administrator clicks a malicious link crafted by an attacker while logged into the LANTIME web interface, the malicious script will be executed within the administrator's browser.
- This could potentially lead to:
  - Misinformation being provided by the time server.
  - Session hijacking, where the attacker gains control over the administrator's active session.
  - Other malicious activities that can be performed through a user's web browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a script. The link has to contain the IP address or hostname of a vulnerable LANTIME system.
- The attacker delivers this link to a target administrator, typically through a compromised web page or by tricking the administrator into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious link that includes the IP address or hostname of the targeted LANTIME device.
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator of the LANTIME device to click the link while having an active session with the device.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the LANTIME device, and can perform this attack remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects LANTIME M-Series products with firmware versions prior to V6.15.019.
- Meinberg recommends updating to firmware version 6.16.002 to resolve the vulnerability for V6.x systems. For older V5.x systems, an update to V6.16.002 is also recommended but may require a flash memory upgrade.
- If an update is not possible, users are advised to avoid browsing insecure websites when accessing the LANTIME web interface, and to always log out and close their browser after use.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
