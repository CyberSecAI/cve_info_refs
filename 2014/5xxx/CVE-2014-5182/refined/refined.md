Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the YAWPP WordPress plugin. This parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The plugin directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in SQL queries, specifically within the `admin_update.php` file and the `update_petition()` function (originally also in `admin_functions.php` prior to patching). This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** A successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to gain access to the WordPress database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the database. This could include sensitive user information, petition data, and potentially lead to a full compromise of the website.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** A contributor user, with the ability to access the plugin's admin pages, is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The primary attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL. The vulnerable pages are `admin.php?page=yawpp&section=update&id=[SQL Injection]`.
*   **Plugin Admin Pages:** The vulnerability is accessible via the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Contributor or Higher Access:**  The attacker needs to be at least a WordPress contributor to access the vulnerable plugin's admin pages.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `admin_update.php` file and `admin_functions.php` are the files primarily affected by the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is where the plugin directly incorporates the `$_GET['id']` parameter into SQL queries. For example:
    ```php
    $wpdb->update($wpdb->prefix."yawpp_petitions", array('title' => $_POST['title'], 'max'=>$_POST['max']), array('id'=>$_GET['id']));
    $p = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."yawpp_petitions WHERE id = ".$_GET['id']);
    $fields = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."yawpp_fields WHERE id_petition = ".$_GET['id']);
    ```
*   The fix involves sanitizing the input using `is_numeric()` and assigning it to a variable before using it in the SQL query, as seen in the updated code:

```php
    if (is_numeric($_GET['id'])){
        $id = $_GET['id'];
    }
    else{
        $id= 0;
    }

    $p = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM ".$wpdb->prefix."yawpp_petitions WHERE id = ".$id);
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed on January 7, 2014 and is no longer available for download, likely due to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 28, 2014.
*   The plugin version 1.2 and probably lower versions are vulnerable. Version 1.2.1 contains the fix for the SQL injection vulnerability
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Anantshri.
