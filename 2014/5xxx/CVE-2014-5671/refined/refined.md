  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly validating the SSL chain, failing to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
