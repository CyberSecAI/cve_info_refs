# libvirt releases

This is the list of official releases for libvirt, along with an overview of
the changes introduced by each of them.

For a more fine-grained view, use the [git log](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commits/master).

# v11.1.0 (unreleased)[¶](#v11-1-0-unreleased "Link to this headline")

* **Packaging changes**

  + De-modularize the 'fs' storage file backend

    The storage file backend for local files uses only code which we compile
    into the internal libraries anyways so there's no point in having it
    as a loadable module. The storage-file/libvirt\_storage\_file\_fs.so module
    no longer exists and its functionality is embedded directly.
* **Security**
* **Removed features**
* **New features**

  + ch: Support handling events from cloud-hypervisor

    The ch driver now supports handling events from the cloud-hypervisor.
    Events include VM lifecyle operations such as shutdown, pause, resume,
    etc. Libvirt will now read these events and take actions such as
    updating domain state, etc.
* **Improvements**
* **Bug fixes**

# v11.0.0 (2025-01-15)[¶](#v11-0-0-2025-01-15 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + network/qemu/lxc: support vlans on standard Linux host bridges

    The network, qemu, and lxc drivers now support (using the
    <vlan> subelement) vlan tagging and trunking on network
    interfaces connected to a standard Linux host bridge.
  + qemu: Add support for direct and extended tlbflush features

    Domains can now utilise more tlbflush hyperv features.
* **Improvements**

  + ch: Enable user aliases

    User can now specify custom aliases for devices in domain XML
  + qemu: Grab a QUERY job when formatting domain XML

    Under some specific conditions it might have happened that domain XML did
    not contain runtime information or returned an XML that's in process of
    changing (e.g. by a thread that's hotplugging a device). Formatting domain
    XML now serializes properly with other threads.
  + virtiofs: Allow read only mode

    The <filesystem/> with virtiofsd backend can now use <readonly/>
    tag to export underlying filesystem in read only mode.
  + qemu: allow migration of vGPU from mdev device <-> SRIOV VF device

    Some GPU vendors are switching from using vGPUs creating using
    mdev and identified with a uuid, to vGPUs created as SRIOV VFs and
    identified by their PCI address, and want to support live
    migration from a host using one type of vGPU to the other
    type. This is now possible.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: tpm: do not update profile name for transient domains

    Fix a possible crash when starting a transient domain which was
    introduced in the previous release.
  + qemu: Fix snapshot to not delete disk image with internal snapshot

    When a VM has internal snapshot that is parent to external snapshot and user
    reverts to the internal snapshot and deletes the external snapshot libvirt
    would delete the disk image containing the internal snapshot. This would
    result in data loss.
  + qemu: Do not format invalid XML with hyperv features in passthrough mode

    When hyperv features were specified together with mode="passthrough"
    libvirt parsed and formatted such features in the domain XML even though
    they were not used at all, resulting in XML that is not valid based on our
    schema. This is now fixed by not parsing any specified features when the
    passthrough mode is used.
  + qemu: Fix a crash when starting a domain with ovs bridge and QOS
  + cpu: Add missing -v1 variants for CPU models

    Some CPU models (mostly old ones) were missed when versioned CPU model
    names were introduced in the previous release.
  + qemu: Fix false error when recovering failed post-copy migration

    In some cases libvirt would report a failure to recover post-copy migration
    even though the recovery started just fine and migration would eventually
    successfully finish.

# v10.10.0 (2024-12-02)[¶](#v10-10-0-2024-12-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: add multi boot device support on s390x

    For classical mainframe guests (i.e. LPAR or z/VM installations), you
    always have to explicitly specify the disk where you want to boot from (or
    "IPL" from, in s390x-speak -- IPL means "Initial Program Load").

    In the past QEMU only used the first device in the boot order to IPL from.
    With the new multi boot device support on s390x that is available with QEMU
    version 9.2 and newer, this limitation is lifted. If the IPL fails for the
    first device with the lowest boot index, the device with the second lowest
    boot index will be tried and so on until IPL is successful or there are no
    remaining boot devices to try.

    Limitation: The s390x BIOS will try to IPL up to 8 total devices, any
    number of which may be disks or network devices.
  + qemu: Add support for versioned CPU models

    Updates to QEMU CPU models with -vN suffix can now be used in libvirt just
    like any other CPU model.
  + qemu: Support for the 'data-file' QCOW2 image feature

    The QEMU hypervisor driver now supports QCOW2 images with 'data-file'
    feature present (both when probing form the image itself and when specified
    explicitly via <dataStore> element). This can be useful when it's
    required to keep data "raw" on disk, but the use case requires features
    of the QCOW2 format such as incremental backups.
  + swtpm: Add support for profiles

    Upcoming swtpm release will have TPM profile support that allows to
    restrict a TPM's provided set of crypto algorithms and commands. Users can
    now select profile by using <profile/> in their TPM XML definition.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Support UEFI NVRAM images on block storage

    Libvirt now allows users to use block storage as backend for UEFI NVRAM
    images and allows them to be in format different than the template. When
    qcow2 is used as the format, the images are now also auto-populated from the
    template.
  + qemu: Automatically add IOMMU when needed

    When domain of 'qemu' or 'kvm' type has more than 255 vCPUs IOMMU with EIM
    mode is required. Starting with this release libvirt automatically adds one
    (or turns on the EIM mode if there's IOMMU without it).
  + ch: allow hostdevs in domain definition

    The Cloud Hypervisor driver (ch) now supports <hostdev/>-s.
  + ch: Enable callbacks for ch domain events

    The Cloud Hypervisor driver (ch) now supports emitting events on domain
    define, undefine, start, boot, stop and destroy.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix reversion and inactive deletion of internal snapshots with UEFI NVRAM

    In [v10.9.0 (2024-11-01)](#v10-9-0-2024-11-01) creation of internal snapshots of VMs with UEFI
    firmware was allowed, but certain operations such as reversion or inactive
    deletion didn't work properly as they didn't consider the NVRAM qcow2 file.
  + virnetdevopenvswitch: Warn on unsupported QoS settings

    For OpenVSwitch vNICs libivrt does not set QoS directly using 'tc' but
    offloads setting to OVS. But OVS is not as feature full as libvirt in this
    regard and setting different 'peak' than 'average' results in vNIC always
    sticking with 'peak'. Produce a warning if that's the case.

# v10.9.0 (2024-11-01)[¶](#v10-9-0-2024-11-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: zero block detection for non-shared-storage migration

    Users can now request that all-zero blocks are not transferred when migrating
    non-shared disk data without actually enabling zero detection on the disk
    itself. This allows sparsifying images during migration where the source
    has no access to the allocation state of blocks at the cost of CPU overhead.

    This feature is available via the --migrate-disks-detect-zeroes option
    for virsh migrate or VIR\_MIGRATE\_PARAM\_MIGRATE\_DISKS\_DETECT\_ZEROES
    migration parameter. See the documentation for caveats.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: internal snapshot improvements

    The qemu internal snapshot handling code was updated to use modern commands
    which avoid the problems the old ones had, preventing use of internal
    snapshots on VMs with UEFI NVRAM. Internal snapshots of VMs using UEFI are
    now possible provided that the NVRAM is in qcow2 format.

    The new code also allows better control when deleting snapshots. To prevent
    possible regressions no strict checking is done, but in case inconsistent
    state is encountered a log message is added:

    ```
    warning : qemuSnapshotActiveInternalDeleteGetDevices:3841 : inconsistent internal snapshot state (deletion): VM='snap' snapshot='1727959843' missing='vda ' unexpected='' extra=''
    ```

    Users are encouraged to report any occurence of the above message along
    with steps they took to the upstream tracker.
  + qemu: improve documentation of image format settings

    The documentation of the various \*\_image\_format settings in qemu.conf
    imply they can only be used to control compression of the image. The
    documentation has been improved to clarify the settings describe the
    representation of guest memory blocks on disk, which includes compression
    among other possible layouts.
  + Report CPU model blockers in domain capabilities

    When a CPU model is reported as usable='no' an additional
    <blockers model='...'> element is added for that CPU model listing
    features required by the CPU model, but not supported on the host.

# v10.8.0 (2024-10-01)[¶](#v10-8-0-2024-10-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Improvements**

  + network: make networks with <forward mode='open'/> more useful

    It is now permissable to have a <forward mode='open'> network that
    has no IP address assigned to the host's port of the bridge. This
    is the only way to create a libvirt network where guests are
    unreachable from the host (and vice versa) and also 0 firewall
    rules are added on the host.

    It is now also possible for a <forward mode='open'/> network to
    use the zone attribute of <bridge> to set the firewalld zone of
    the bridge interface (normally it would not be set, as is done
    with other forward modes).
  + storage: Lessen dependancy on the showmount program

    Libvirt now automatically detects presence of showmount during runtime
    as we do with other helper programs and also the
    daemon-driver-storage-core RPM package now doesn't strongly depend on it
    if the users wish for a more minimal deployment.
  + Switch from YAJL to json-c for JSON parsing and formatting

    The parser and formatter in the libvirt library, as well
    as the parsers in the nss plugin were rewritten to use json-c
    instead of YAJL, which is effectively dead upstream.
  + Relax restrictions for memorytune settings

    It should now be possible to use resctrl on AMD CPUs as well as Intel CPUs
    when the resctrl filesystem is mounted with mba\_MBps option.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virsh: Fix script-friedly output of virsh list --uuid

    The script-friendly output of just 1 UUID per line was mistakenly replaced
    by the full human-targetted table view full of redundant information
    and very hard to parse. Users who wish to see the UUIDs in the tabular
    output need to use virsh list --table --uuid as old behaviour was
    reverted.

    Note that this also broke the libvirt-guests script. The bug was
    introduced in [v10.7.0 (2024-09-02)](#v10-7-0-2024-09-02).
  + network/qemu: fix some cases where device-update of a network
    interface was failing:

    - If the interface was connected to a libvirt network that was
      providing a pool of VFs to be used with macvtap passthrough
      mode, then *any* update to the interface would fail, even
      changing the link state. Updating (the updateable parts of) a
      macvtap passthrough interface will now succeed.
    - It previously was not possible to move an interface from a Linux
      host bridge to an OVS bridge. This (and the opposite direction)
      now works.
  + qemu: backup: Fix possible crashes when running monitoring commands during backup job

    The qemu monitor code was fixed to not crash in specific cases when
    monitoing APIs are called during a backup job.
  + Fix various memleaks and overflows

    Multiple memory leaks and overflows in corner cases were fixed based on
    upstream issues reported.
  + network: Better cleanup after disappeared networks

    If a network disappeared while virtnetworkd was not running not all clean up
    was done properly once the daemon was started, especially when only the
    network interface disappeared. This could have in some cases resulted in
    the network being shown as inactive, but not being able to start.
  + qemu: Remember memory backing directory for domains

    If memory\_backing\_dir is changed during the lifetime of a domain with
    file backed memory, files in the old directory would not be cleaned up once
    the domain is shut down. Now the directory that was used during startup is
    remembered for each running domain.

# v10.7.0 (2024-09-02)[¶](#v10-7-0-2024-09-02 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + CVE-2024-8235: Crash of virtinterfaced via virConnectListInterfaces()

    A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs
    introduced corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory
    results in a NULL pointer.

    This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent
    crash of virtinterfaced if virConnectListInterfaces() is called
    requesting 0 networks to be filled.

    The bug was introduced in libvirt-10.4.0
* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce the ability to disable the built-in PS/2 controller

    It is now possible to control the state of the ps2 feature in the
    domain XML for descendants of the generic PC machine type (i440fx,
    q35, xenfv and isapc).
  + qemu: Add support for hyperv enlightenment feature hv-emsr-bitmap

    It is introduced since QEMU 7.10, allowing L0 (KVM) and L1 (Hyper-V)
    hypervisors to collaborate to avoid unnecessary updates to L2 MSR-Bitmap
    upon vmexits.
  + qemu: Add support for hyperv enlightenment feature hv-xmm-input

    It is introduced since QEMU 7.10, allowing to pass parameters for
    certain hypercalls using XMM registers (“XMM Fast Hypercall Input”).
* **Improvements**

  + ch: support restore with network devices

    Cloud-Hypervisor starting from V40.0 supports restoring file descriptor
    backed network devices. So, create new net fds and pass them via
    SCM\_RIGHTS to CH during restore operation.
  + ch: support basic networking modes
    Cloud-Hypervisor driver now supports Ethernet, Network (NAT) and Bridge
    networking modes.

# v10.6.0 (2024-08-05)[¶](#v10-6-0-2024-08-05 "Link to this headline")

* **Removed features**

  + qemu: Require QEMU-5.2.0 or newer

    The minimal required version of QEMU was bumped to 5.2.0.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for the 'pauth' Arm CPU feature
  + Introduce pstore device

    The aim of pstore device is to provide a bit of NVRAM storage for guest
    kernel to record oops/panic logs just before it crashes. Typical usage
    includes usage in combination with a watchdog so that the logs can be
    inspected after the watchdog rebooted the machine.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Set 'passt' net backend if 'default' is unsupported

    If QEMU is compiled without SLIRP support, and if domain XML allows it,
    starting from this release libvirt will use passt as the default backend
    instead. Also, supported backends are now reported in the domain
    capabilities XML.
  + qemu: add a monitor to /proc/$pid when killing times out

    In cases when a QEMU process takes longer to be killed, libvirt might have
    skipped cleaning up after it. But now a /proc/$pid watch is installed so
    this does not happen ever again.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virt-aa-helper: Allow RO access to /usr/share/edk2-ovmf

    When binary version of edk2 is distributed, the files reside under
    /usr/share/edk2-ovmf. Allow virt-aa-helper to generate paths under that
    directory.
  + virt-host-validate: Allow longer list of CPU flags

    During its run, virt-host-validate parses /proc/cpuinfo to learn about CPU
    flags. But due to a bug it parsed only the first 1024 bytes worth of CPU
    flags leading to unexpected results. The file is now parsed properly.
  + capabilities: Be more forgiving when decoding OEM strings

    On some systems, OEM strings are scattered in multiple sections. This
    confused libvirt when generating capabilities XML. Not anymore.

# v10.5.0 (2024-07-01)[¶](#v10-5-0-2024-07-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Introduce SEV-SNP support

    SEV-SNP is introduced as another type of <launchSecurity/>. Its support
    is reported in both domain capabilities and virt-host-validate.
* **Improvements**

  + tools: virt-pki-validate has been rewritten in C

    The virt-pki-validate shell script has been rewritten as a C program,
    providing an output format that matches virt-host-validate, removing
    the dependency on certtool and providing more comprehensive checks
    of the certificate properties.
  + qemu: implement iommu coldplug/unplug

    The <iommu/> device can be now cold plugged and/or cold unplugged.
  + Pass shutoff reason to release hook

    Sometimes in release hook it is useful to know if the VM shutdown was
    graceful or not. This is especially useful to do cleanup based on the VM
    shutdown failure reason in release hook. Starting with this release the
    last argument 'extra' is used to pass VM shutoff reason in the call to
    release hook.
  + nodedev: improve DASD detection

    In newer DASD driver versions the ID\_TYPE tag is supported. This tag is
    missing after a system reboot but when the ccw device is set offline and
    online the tag is included. To fix this version independently we need to
    check if a device detected as type disk is actually a DASD to maintain the
    node object consistency and not end up with multiple node objects for
    DASDs.
* **Bug fixes**

  + remote\_daemon\_dispatch: Unref sasl session when closing client connection

    A memory leak was identified when a client started SASL but then suddenly
    closed connection. This is now fixed.
  + qemu: Fix migration with disabled vmx-\* CPU features

    Migrating a domain with some vmx-\* CPU features marked as disabled could
    have failed as the destination would incorrectly expect those features to
    be enabled after starting QEMU.
  + qemu: Fix libvirtd/virtqemud crash when VM shuts down during migration

    The libvirt daemon could crash when a VM was shut down while being migrated
    to another host.

# v10.4.0 (2024-06-03)[¶](#v10-4-0-2024-06-03 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + CVE-2024-4418: Fix stack use-after-free in virNetClientIOEventLoop()

    Fix race condition leading to a stack use-after-free bug was found in libvirt.
    Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the data
    pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being
    used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame
    was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop().
    This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without
    authenticating.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Support for ras feature for virt machine type

    It is now possible to set on/off ras feature in the domain XML for virt
    (Arm) machine type as <ras state='on'/>.
  + SSH proxy for VM

    Libvirt now installs a binary helper that allows connecting to QEMU domains
    via SSH using the following scheme: ssh user@qemu/virtualMachine.
  + qemu: Support for virtio sound model

    Sound devices can now be configured to use the virtio model with
    <sound model='virtio'/>. This model is available from QEMU 8.2.0
    onwards.
  + network: use nftables to setup virtual network firewall rules

    The network driver can now use nftables rules for the virtual
    network firewalls, rather than iptables. With the standard build
    options, nftables is preferred over iptables (with fallback to
    iptables if nftables isn't installed), but this can be modified at
    build time, or at runtime via the firewall\_backend setting in
    network.conf. (NB: the nwfilter driver still uses
    ebtables/iptables).
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: add zstd to supported compression formats

    Extend the list of supported formats of QEMU save image by adding zstd
    compression.
  + qemu: Implement support for hotplugging evdev input devices

    As of this release, hotplug and hotunplug of evdev <input/> devices is
    supported.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virsh/virt-admin: Fix --help option for all commands

    A bug introduced in [v10.3.0 (2024-05-02)](#v10-3-0-2024-05-02) caused that the attempt to print
    help for any command by using the --help option in virsh and
    virt-admin would print:

    ```
    $ virsh list --help
    error: command 'list' doesn't support option --help
    ```

    instead of the help output. A workaround for the affected version is to use
    the help command:

    ```
    $ virsh help list
    ```
  + qemu: Fix virsh save and migration when storage in question is root\_squashed NFS

    Attempting to save a VM to a root\_squash NFS mount or migrating with disks
    hosted on such mount could, in some scenarios, result in error stating:

    ```
    'Unknown error 255'
    ```

    The bug was introduced in [v10.1.0 (2024-03-01)](#v10-1-0-2024-03-01).
  + qemu: Don't set affinity for isolcpus unless explicitly requested

    When starting a domain, by default libvirt sets affinity of QEMU process to
    all online CPUs. This also included isolated CPUs (isolcpus=) which is
    wrong. As of this release, isolated CPUs are left untouched, unless
    explicitly configured in domain XML.
  + qemu\_hotplug: Properly assign USB address to hotplugged usb-net device

    Previously, the network device hotplug logic would try to ensure only CCW
    or PCI addresses. With recent support for the usb-net model, USB addresses
    for usb-net network devices are assigned automatically.
  + qemu: Fix hotplug of virtiofs filesystem device with <boot order= set

    The bug was introduced in [v10.3.0 (2024-05-02)](#v10-3-0-2024-05-02) when attempting to reject
    unsupported configurations. During hotplug the addresses are
    assigned after validation and thus errorneously reject valid configs.

# v10.3.0 (2024-05-02)[¶](#v10-3-0-2024-05-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Proper support for USB network device

    USB address is now automatically assigned to USB network devices thus they
    can be used without manual configuration.
  + conf: Introduce memReserve attribute to <controller/>

    Some PCI devices have large non-prefetchable memory. This can be a problem
    in case when such device needs to be hotplugged as the firmware can't
    foresee such situation. The user thus can override the value calculated at
    start to accomodate for such devices.
* **Improvements**

  + Improve validation of USB devices

    Certain USB device types ('sound', 'fs', 'chr', 'ccid' and 'net') were not
    properly handled in the check whether the VM config supports USB and thus
    would result in poor error messages.
  + virsh: Fix behaviour of --name and --parent used together when listing checkpoint and snapshots

    The checkpoint-list and snapshot-list commands would ignore the
    --name option to print only the name when used with --parent.
  + Extend libvirt-guests to shutdown only persistent VMs

    Users can now choose to shutdown only persistent VMs when the host is being
    shut down.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix migration with custom XML

    Libvirt 10.2.0 would sometimes complain about incompatible CPU definition
    when trying to migrate or save a domain and passing a custom XML even
    though such XML was properly generated as migratable. Hitting this bug
    depends on the guest CPU definition and the host on which a particular
    domain was running.
  + qemu: Fix TLS hostname verification failure in certain non-shared storage migration scenarios

    In certain scenarios (parallel migration, newly also post-copy migration)
    libvirt would wrongly pass an empty hostname to QEMU to be used for TLS
    certificate hostname validation, which would result into failure of the
    non-shared storage migration step:

    ```
    error: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'blockdev-add': Certificate does not match the hostname
    ```
  + Create OVS ports as transient

    Libvirt now creates OVS ports as transient which prevents them from
    reappearing or going stale on sudden reboots.
  + Clear OVS QoS settings when domain shuts down

    Libvirt now clears QoS settings on domain shutdown, so they no longer pile
    up in OVS database.

# v10.2.0 (2024-04-02)[¶](#v10-2-0-2024-04-02 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + CVE-2024-2494: remote: check for negative array lengths before allocation
  > Fix the flaw of the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server
  > de-serialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative
  > length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative length
  > to the g\_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length being
  > treated as a huge positive number. A local unprivileged user could use this
  > flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to
  > crash.
* **New features**

  + ch: Basic save and restore support for ch driver

    The ch driver now supports basic save and restore operations. This is
    functional on domains without any network, host device config defined.
    The path parameter for save and restore should be a directory.
  + qemu: Support for driver type mtp in <filesystem/> devices

    The mtp driver type exposes the usb-mtp device in QEMU. The
    guest can access files on this driver through the Media Transfer
    Protocol (MTP).
  + qemu: Added support for the loongarch64 architecture

    It is now possible for libvirt to run loongarch64 guests, including on
    other architectures via TCG. For the best results, it is recommended to
    use the upcoming QEMU 9.0.0 release together with the development version
    of edk2.
  + qemu: Introduce virDomainGraphicsReload API

    Reloading the graphics display is now supported for QEMU guests using
    VNC. This is useful to make QEMU reload the TLS certificates without
    restarting the guest. Available via the virDomainGraphicsReload API
    and the domdisplay-reload virsh command.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix migration from libvirt older than 9.10.0 when vmx is enabled

    A domain with vmx feature enabled (which may be even done automatically
    with mode='host-model') started by libvirt 9.9.0 or older cannot be
    migrated to libvirt 9.10.0, 10.0.0, and 10.1.0 as the target host would
    complain about a lot of extra vmx-\* features. Migration of similar
    domains started by the affected releases to libvirt 9.9.0 and older
    does not work either. Since libvirt 10.2.0 migration works again with
    libvirt 9.9.0 and older in both directions. Migration from the affected
    releases to 10.2.0 works as well, but the other direction remains broken
    unless the fix is backported.
  + node\_device: Don't report spurious errors from PCI VPD parsing

    In last release the PCI Vital Product Data parser was enhanced to report
    errors but that effort failed as some kernels have the file but don't allow
    reading it causing logs to be spammed with:

    ```
    libvirtd[21055]: operation failed: failed to read the PCI VPD data
    ```

    Since the data is used only in the node device XML and errors are ignored if
    the parsing failed, this release removes all the error reporting.
  + qemu: set correct SELinux label for unprivileged virtiofsd

    It is now possible to use virtiofsd-based <filesystem> shares even
    if the guest is confined using SELinux.
  + qemu: fix a crash on unprivileged virtiofsd hotplug

    Hotplugging virtiofsd-based filesystems works now.
  + virt-admin: Fix segfault when libvirtd dies

    virt-admin no longer crashes when libvirtd unexpectedly closes
    the connection.

# v10.1.0 (2024-03-01)[¶](#v10-1-0-2024-03-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + CVE-2024-1441: Fix off-by-one error leading to a crash

    In **libvirt-1.0.0** there were couple of interface listing APIs
    introduced which had an off-by-one error. That error could lead to a
    very rare crash if an array was passed to those functions which did
    not fit all the interfaces.

    In **libvirt-5.10** a check for non-NULL arrays has been adjusted to
    allow for NULL arrays with size 0 instead of rejecting all NULL
    arrays. However that made the above issue significantly worse since
    that off-by-one error now did not write beyond an array, but
    dereferenced said NULL pointer making the crash certain in a
    specific scenario in which a NULL array of size 0 was passed to the
    aforementioned functions.
* **New features**

  + nodedev: Support updating mdevs

    The node device driver has been extended to allow updating mediated node
    devices. Options are available to target the update against the persistent,
    active or both configurations of a mediated device.
    **Note:** The support is only available with at least mdevctl v1.3.0 installed.
  + qemu: Add support for /dev/userfaultfd

    On hosts with new enough kernel which supports /dev/userfaultfd libvirt will
    now automatically grant QEMU access to this device. It's no longer needed to
    set vm.unprivileged\_userfaultfd sysctl.
  + qemu: Support clusters in CPU topology

    It is now possible to configure the guest CPU topology to use clusters.
    Additionally, if CPU clusters are present in the host topology, they will
    be reported as part of the capabilities XML.
  + network: Make virtual domains resolvable from the host

    When starting a virtual network with a new register='yes' attribute
    in the <domain> element, libvirt will configure systemd-resolved
    to resolve names of the connected guests using the name server started
    for this network.
  + qemu: Introduce dynamicMemslots attribute for virtio-mem

    QEMU now allows setting .dynamic-memslots attribute for virtio-mem-pci
    devices. When turned on, it allows memory exposed to guest to be split into
    multiple memory slots and thus smaller memory footprint (see the original
    commit for detailed explanation).
* **Improvements**

  + nodedev: Add ability to update persistent mediated devices by defining them

    Existing persistent mediated devices can now also be updated by
    virNodeDeviceDefineXML() as long as parent and UUID remain unchanged.
  + ch: Enable ethernet interface mode support

    <interface type='ethernet'/> can now be used for CH domains.
  + viraccessdriverpolkit: Add missing vtpm case

    Secrets with <usage type='vtpm'> were left unable to be checked for in
    the access driver, i.e. in ACL rules. Missing code was provided.
  + virt-admin: Notify users to use explicit URI if connection fails

    virt-admin doesn't try to guess the URI of the daemon to manage so a
    failure to connect may be confusing for users if modular daemons are used.
    Add a hint to use the URI of the dameon to manage.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu\_process: Skip over non-virtio non-TAP NIC models when refreshing rx-filter

    If trustGuestRxFilters is enabled for a vNIC that doesn't support it,
    libvirt may throw an error when such domain is being started, loaded from a
    saved state, migrated, etc. These errors are now silenced, but make sure to
    fix such configurations (after previous release it is even possible to
    change trustGuestRxFilters value on live domains via
    virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags() or virsh device-update).
  + domain: Fix check for overlapping <memory/> devices

    A bug was identified which caused libvirt to report two NVDIMMs as
    overlapping even though they weren't. This now fixed.
  + vmx: Accept empty fileName for cdrom-image

    Turns out, fileName attribute (which contains path to CDROM image) can
    be set to an empty string ("") to denote a state in which the CDROM has
    no medium in it. Libvirt used to reject such configuration file, but not
    anymore.
  + qemu\_hotplug: Don't lose 'created' flag in qemuDomainChangeNet()

    When starting a domain, libvirt tracks what resources it created for it and
    which were pre-existing and uses this information to preserve pre-existing
    resources when cleaning up after said domain is shut off. But for macvtaps
    this information was lost after the macvtap device was changed (e.g. via
    virsh update-device).
  + Fix virStream hole handling

    When a client sent multiple holes into a virStream it may have caused
    daemon hangup as the daemon stopped processing RPC from the client
    temporarily. This is now fixed.
  + nodedev: Don't generate broken XML with certain hardware

    A broken node device XML would be generated in a rare case when a hardware
    device had certain characters in the VPD fields.
  + qemu: Fix reservation of manually specified port for disk migration

    A manually specified port would not be relased after disk migration making
    it impossible to use it again.

# v10.0.0 (2024-01-15)[¶](#v10-0-0-2024-01-15 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Enable postcopy-preempt migration capability

    Post-copy migrations are now started with postcopy-preempt
    capability enabled as long as it is supported by both sides of migration.
    This should enable faster migration of memory pages that the destination
    tries to read before they are migrated from the source.
  + qemu: Add support for mapping iothreads to virtqueues of virtio-blk devices

    QEMU added the possibility to map multiple iothreads to a single
    virtio-blk device and map them even to specific virtqueues. Libvirt
    adds a <iothreads> subelement of the <disk> <driver> element that
    users can use to configure the mapping.
  + qemu: Allow automatic resize of block-device-backed disk to full size of the device

    The new flag VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_RESIZE\_CAPACITY for
    virDomainBlockResize allows resizing a block-device backed raw disk
    of a VM without the need to specify the full size of the block device.
  + qemu: automatic selection/binding of VFIO variant drivers

    When a device is assigned to a guest using VFIO with <hostdev managed='yes'>, libvirt will now search the running kernel's
    modules.alias file for the most specific match to that device for
    a VFIO driver, and bind that driver to the device rather than
    vfio-pci. A specific driver can also be forced, using the
    <driver model='plugh'/> attribute.
  + qemu: add runtime configuration option for nbdkit

    Since the new nbdkit support requires a recent selinux policy that is not
    widely available yet, it is now possible to build libvirt with nbdkit
    support for remote disks but disabled at runtime. This behavior is
    controlled via the storage\_use\_nbdkit option of the qemu driver
    configuration file. The option will default to being disabled, but this may
    change in a future release and can be customized with the
    nbdkit\_config\_default build option.
  + qemu: add ID mapping support for virtiofsd

    New <idmap> element was added for virtiofsd-based <filesystem>
    devices. It can be used to set up UID and GID mapping between host
    and guest, making running virtiofsd unprivileged much more useful.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Improve migration XML use when persisting VM on destination

    When migrating a VM with a custom migration XML, use it as a base for
    persisting it on the destination as users could have changed non-ABI
    breaking facts which would prevent subsequent start if the old XML were used.
  + qemu: Simplify non-shared storage migration to raw block devices

    The phase of copying storage during migration without shared storage
    requires that both the source and destination image are identical in size.
    This may not be possible if the destination is backed by a block device
    and the source image size is not a multiple of the block device block size.

    Libvirt aleviates this by automatically adding a <slice> to match the
    size of the source image rather than failing the migration.
  + test driver: Support for hotplug/hotunplug of PCI devices

    The test driver now supports basic hotplug and hotunplug of PCI devices.
  + qemu: allow virtiofsd to run unprivileged

    Nowadays virtiofsd no longer requires to run with root privileges, so the
    restriction to always run as root is now removed from libvirt too.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Various migration bug fixes and debuggability improvement

    This release fixes multiple bugs in virsh and libvirt in handling of
    migration arguments and XMLs and modifies error reporting for better
    debugging.
  + conf: Restore setting default bus for input devices

    Because of a regression, starting from 9.3.0 libvirt did not autofill bus
    for input devices. With this release the regression was identified and
    fixed.
  + qemu: Relax check for memory device coldplug

    Because of a check that was too aggressive, a virtio-mem memory device
    could not be cold plugged. This is now fixed.
  + qemu: Be less aggressive when dropping channel source paths

    Another regression is resolved, (introduced in 9.7.0) when libvirt was too
    aggressive when dropping parsed paths for <channel/> sources
  + qemuDomainChangeNet: Reflect trustGuestRxFilters change

    On device-update, when a user requested change of trustGuestRxFilters for a
    domain's <interface/> libvirt did nothing. It did not throw an error nor
    did it reflect the change. Starting with this release, the change is
    reflected.

# v9.10.0 (2023-12-01)[¶](#v9-10-0-2023-12-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Introduce pipewire audio backend

    The QEMU hypervisor driver now allows setting pipewire backend for
    <audio/> device.
* **Improvements**

  + Adapt to qemu's use of protocol drivers in QCOW2 'backing file format' field

    QEMU allows creating images where the 'backing file format' is actually a
    protocol name such as 'file'/'host\_device'/'nbd'/etc.. Adapt libvirt to
    properly handle such images and don't assume automatic format probing is
    necessary, which is in many cases forbidden due to security implications.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix setup of images on hotplug of disk

    Internal image metadata was not setup correctly which could cause some disk
    hotplug configurations (namely those including backing images) to fail.
  + qemu: Fix qemu crash when reverting an internal snapshot

    Libvirt attempted to start qemu with wrong arguments when attempting to
    revert to an internal snapshot causing qemu to crash.
  + qemu: Fix hotplug of empty cdrom

    Empty cdrom drive couldn't be hotplugged as libvirt wanted to setup the
    storage backing it unconditionally.

# v9.9.0 (2023-11-01)[¶](#v9-9-0-2023-11-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + QEMU: implement reverting external snapshots

    Reverting external snapshots is now possible using the existing API
    virDomainSnapshotRevert(). Management application can check host
    capabilities for <externalSnapshot/> element within the list of
    guest features to see if the current libvirt supports both deleting
    and reverting external snapshots.
  + virsh: add console --resume support

    The virsh console subcommand now accepts a --resume option. This
    will resume a paused guest after connecting to the console.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Improve virsh start --console behavior

    The virsh start --console now tries to connect to the guest console
    before starting the vCPUs.
  + virsh: Improve virsh create --console behavior

    The virsh create --console now tries to connect to the guest console
    before starting the vCPUs.

# v9.8.0 (2023-10-02)[¶](#v9-8-0-2023-10-02 "Link to this headline")

    The network object now has a new event ID VIR\_NETWORK\_EVENT\_ID\_METADATA\_CHANGE
    that can be used to get notifications upon changes in any of <title>,
    <description> or <metadata>.
  + qemu: Add support for vDPA block devices

    With a new enough version of qemu, libvirt will allow you to assign vDPA block
    devices to a domain. This is configured with:

    ```
    <disk type='vhostvdpa'>
      <source dev='/dev/vhost-vdpa-0'>
      ...
    ```
  + cpu\_map: Add the EPYC-Genoa cpu model

    This model is introduced since QEMU 8.1.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: add nbdkit backend for network disks

    Up until now, libvirt supported network disks (http, ftp, ssh) by passing
    the URL to qemu and having the appropriate qemu block drivers handle the
    disk I/O. However, by handling the network I/O outside of the qemu process,
    we get several advantages, such as reduced attack surface and improved
    stability of qemu. Therefore, when available, libvirt will use nbdkit as a
    backend for these network disks and export an NBD disk to qemu.
  + virnetdevopenvswitch: Propagate OVS error messages

    When configuring OVS interfaces/bridges libvirt used to report its own
    error messages instead of passing (more accurate) error messages from
    ovs-vsctl. This is now changed.
  + Various virtio-mem/virtio-pmem fixes

    Now libvirt validates more values of virtio-mem and virtio-pmem devices,
    e.g. overlapping memory addresses or alignment.

# v9.7.0 (2023-09-01)[¶](#v9-7-0-2023-09-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: basic support for use of "VFIO variant" drivers

    A VFIO variant driver is a device-specific driver that can
    be used in place of the generic vfio-pci driver, and provides
    extra functionality to support things like live migration of
    guests with vfio-assigned devices. It can currently be used by:

    1. setting managed='no' in the XML configuration for the device
    2. pre-binding the variant driver using the --driver option of
       virsh nodedev-detach.
  + network: Support for <title> and <description> fields in Network XML

    The network object adds two more user defined metadata fields <title>
    and <description>.
    Two new APIs virNetworkGetMetadata() and virNetworkSetMetadata() can be
    used to view and modify the above including the existing <metadata> field.

    virsh adds two new commands net-desc and net-metadata to view/modify the same.
    net-list adds a new option --title that prints the content of <title>
    in an extra column within the default --table output.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Various fixes to firmware selection

    The changes made to firmware selection in libvirt 9.2.0 have unfortunately
    introduced a number of regressions. All known issues in this area have now
    been resolved.

# v9.6.0 (2023-08-01)[¶](#v9-6-0-2023-08-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + CVE-2023-3750: Fix race condition in storage driver leading to a crash

    In **libvirt-8.3** a bug was introduced which in rare cases could cause
    libvirtd or virtstoraged to crash if multiple clients attempted to
    look up a storage volume by key, path or target path, while other clients
    attempted to access something from the same storage pool.
* **Improvements**

  + apparmor: All profiles and abstractions now support local overrides

    This has long been the case for the virt-aa-helper profile, but has
    now been extended to all other profiles and abstractions. The mechanism
    used is the standard AppArmor 3.x one, where the contents of foo and
    abstractions/foo can be overridden by creating local/foo and
    abstractions/foo.d respectively.
  + qemu: Support removable attribute for scsi disk

    Now the scsi disk device (/disk@device='disk' and
    /disk/target@bus='scsi') supports the removable attribute at
    /disk/target@removable`.
  + qemu: Add NUMA node automatically for memory hotplug

    Users no longer need to specify guest NUMA node in the domain XML when
    enabling memory hotplug, libvirt automatically adds one when it is missing.
  + qemu: Consider BeeGFS as a shared filesystem

    Allow migration with non-shared storage for VMs accessing storage via
    BeeGFS.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Adapt to new way of specifying PC speaker

    PC speaker is now usable again with newer QEMU since the change of how it
    is specified on the command line.
  + qemu\_tpm: Try harder to create emulator state

    Libvirt no longer considers empty directory valid SWTPM state and setup is
    now run properly in such case.

# v9.5.0 (2023-07-03)[¶](#v9-5-0-2023-07-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Allow configuring the discard-no-unref feature of qcow2 driver

    The new discard\_no\_unref attribute of the disk driver element
    controls whether the qcow2 driver in qemu unrefs clusters inside the
    image on discard requests. Disabling cluster unrefing decreases fragmentation
    of the image.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Include maximum physical address size in baseline CPU

    When computing a baseline CPU definition for a set of hosts, we need to
    include maximum physical address size in the result to make sure it is
    compatible with all hosts even if their supported physical address sizes
    differ.
  + conf: Properly handle slots for non-DIMM <memory> devices

    Memory devices such as virtio-mem don't need a memory slot as they are
    PCI devices. libvirt now properly accounts the memory slots for such
    devices as well as specifying the slots attribute of the <maxMemory>
    element is no longer needed unless DIMM-like devices are to be used.
  + passt log and port forwarding improvements

    Libvirt now ensures that the passt helper process can access the
    configured log file even when it's placed in a directory without permissions.

    The <portForward> element of a passt-backed interface can now omit the
    address attribute as it's enough to specify a dev.
* **Bug fixes**

  + lxc: Allow seeking in /proc/meminfo to resove failure with new procps package

    New version of the free command from procps package seeks into the
    /proc/meminfo file, which was not supported by the instance of the file
    exposed via LXC causing a failure.
  + qemu: Fix rare race-condition when detaching a device

    The device removal handler callback function didn't re-check the state of
    the unplug operation after a timeout, which could rarely cause that the
    device was removed from the VM but not the definition.
  + qemu: Fix NUMA memory allocation logic

    QEMU allocates memory via the emulator thread thus that has to be allowed
    to access all configured NUMA nodes of the VM rather than just the one where
    it's supposed to be pinned.
  + qemu: Fix setup of hostdev backed <interface>

    The proper steps to initialize the host device were skipped for interfaces
    due to a logic bug preventing start of VM which used them.

# v9.4.0 (2023-06-01)[¶](#v9-4-0-2023-06-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Support compression for parallel migration

    QEMU supports parallel migration to be compressed using either zstd or zlib.
  + cpu\_map: Add SapphireRapids cpu model

    This model is introduced since QEMU 8.0.
* **Improvements**

  + Adapt to musl-1.2.4

    The latest version of musl stopped declaring some symbols that libvirt's
    test suite used (for redirecting stat() family of functions), leaving
    the tests broken. This is now fixed and the test suite works even with the
    latest version of musl.
  + conf: Introduce <address/> for virtio-mem and virtio-pmem

    To ensure guest ABI stability, libvirt persists address for memory devices,
    now including virtio-mem and virtio-pmem. The address can be also
    specified by user.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Account for NVMe disks when calculating memlock limit on hotplug

    When no <hard\_limit/> is set, libvirt still tries to guess a sensible
    limit for memlock for domains. But this limit was not calculated properly
    on a hotplug of <disk type='nvme'/>.
  + numa: Deny other memory modes than restrictive` if a memnode is restrictive

    Due to a missing check it was possible to define a domain with incorrect
    <numatune/>. For instance it was possible to have a <memnode mode="restrictive"/> and <memory/> of a different mode. This is now
    forbidden and if either all <memnode/>-s and <memory/> have to have
    restrictive mode, or none.
  + qemu: Start emulator thread with more generous cpuset.mems

    To ensure memory is allocated only from configured NUMA nodes, libvirt sets
    up cpuset CGgroup controller, even before QEMU is executed. But this may
    prevent QEMU from setting affinity of threads that allocate memory. Since
    these threads are spawned from the emulator thread, the initial set up must
    be more generous and include union of all host NUMA nodes that are allowed
    in the domain definition. Once QEMU has allocated all its memory, the
    emulator thread is restricted further, as it otherwise would be.

# v9.3.0 (2023-05-02)[¶](#v9-3-0-2023-05-02 "Link to this headline")

    igb is a successor to the e1000e network device using PCIe interface.
    It was introduced in QEMU 8.0
  + qemu: Improve handling of maximum physical address configuration
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Change default machine type for ARM and RISC-V

    ARM and RISC-V architectures now use the virt machine type by default.
    The previous defaults were nearly unusable and had to be overridden in most
    cases.
  + Improve translatable strings format substitutions

    All translatable error messages with substitution strings were converted to
    use positional modifiers to allow translators to shuffle around words in
    the translation. The translations in Weblate were also updated to match.
  + qemu: Improve validation of watchdog devices

    Certain invalid configurations of watchdog device are now properly
    detected:

    > - hotplug of always-present platform watchdogs is forbidden
    > - iTCO watchdog can be configured only once
    > - ib700 watchdog is allowed only on i440fx machines
  + Improved output of virt-host-validate on ARM

    Our validation tool now parses the IORT data on ARM to properly detect
    presence of SMMU and other features.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix inactive internal snapshots of VM with UEFI firmware

    Recent changes to UEFI firmware handling resulted into breaking support
    for inactive internal snapshots of VMs with UEFI which historically worked.
    (Although the intention was to disallow them together with active ones, but
    the check did not work properly.)

    Preserve existing functionality by allowing such snapshots explicitly.
  + qemu: Properly configure locked memory limit for VMs with <disk type='nvme'

    The NVMe driver in qemu requires some memory to be locked. This was not
    taken into account in the code which calculates the memory limits based
    on devices present in the configuration
  + Fix native build on win32

    Various improvements to the build system now allow users to build the client
    library of libvirt on win32 natively.
  + qemu: Properly detect tray of hotplugged CD-ROM devices

    Media in a CD-ROM device which was hotplugged could not be changed as the
    presence of the tray was not detected properly on hotplug.

# v9.2.0 (2023-04-01)[¶](#v9-2-0-2023-04-01 "Link to this headline")

    This type of firmware can be picked up either automatically, if the
    corresponding JSON descriptor has the highest priority, or manually by
    using <loader format='qcow2'/> in the domain XML.
  + qemu: Implement QEMU NBD reconnect delay attribute

    Support the nbd reconnect-delay of QEMU. It will set the delay time for
    reconnect after an unexpected disconnect or a serious error.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Make firmware selection persistent

    Up until now, firmware autoselection has been performed at domain startup
    time: as a result, changes to the JSON firmware descriptors present on the
    system could have translated to a different firmware being chosen for
    subsequent startups of the same domain, potentially rendering it unbootable
    or lowering the security guarantees. Firmware selection now happens once,
    when the domain is defined, and its results are stored in the domain XML
    to be reused, unchanged, for all subsequent boots.
  + qemu: passt now works when SELinux/AppArmor is enabled

    In the case of SELinux, this requires passt-specific support code to be
    present in the host policy, so it might only work with upcoming operating
    systems and not with existing ones.
  + xen: Support custom UEFI firmware paths

    The Xen libxl driver now supports specifying a custom UEFI firmware path.
    Previously the Xen default was used in all cases.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix validation of the HPET timer

    Due to a logic bug introduced in libvirt 9.0.0, VM configurations
    explicitly enabling the HPET timer were rejected.
  + qemu: Fix thread-context .host-nodes generation

    With new enough QEMU, libvirt instructs QEMU to set affinity of memory
    allocation threads. But this may have resulted in QEMU being unable to do
    so, as affinity to NUMA nodes inaccessible to emulator thread might have
    been requested.
  + rpc: fix typo in admin code generation

    Fix the bug in the remote virt-admin code generator, that resulted
    in a crash. Introduced in libvirt 9.1.0.
  + qemu: relax shared memory check for vhostuser daemons

    Fix hotplug of virtiofs filesystem after restarting libvirtd.
    Before, libvirtd would incorrectly complain about missing shared

    Libvirt can now support use of the VirtualBox 7.0, This is compile tested
    only, so we are looking for feedback from users on how well it works in
    practice.
  + qemu: Support crypto device

    Support crypto device(virtio crypto only), also add support for QEMU with
    backend builtin and lkcf.
  + qemu: added support for pvpanic-pci device

    A pvpanic device can be now defined as a PCI device (the original is an ISA
    device) with <panic model='pvpanic'/>.
  + qemu: support automatic restart of inadvertently terminated passt process

    If the passt process that is serving as the backend of a -netdev
    stream is terminated unexpectedly, libvirt now listens to QEMU's
    notification of this, and starts up a new passt instance, thus
    preserving network connectivity.
* **Improvements**

  + RPM packaging changes

    The libvirt-daemon subpackage is split into several new subpackages,
    allowing installation of a modular daemon configuration without the
    traditional monolithic libvirtd.
* **Bug fixes**

  + QEMU: iTCO watchdog made operational

    The watchdog was always included when q35 machine type was used, but needed
    an extra bit of configuration in order to be operational. This is now done
    by default when running a QEMU domain with q35 machine type. This is not a
    change in the guest ABI, but it is a guest visible behavior change since the
    watchdog that did not fire before will now fire once used. To switch to the
    previous behavior the watchdog action must be set to none.
  + QEMU: fix deleting memory snapshot when deleting external snapshots

    When external snapshot deletion was introduced it did not remove memory
    snapshot when it existed. In addition when external memory only snapshot
    was created libvirt failed without producing any error.
  + QEMU: properly report passt startup errors

    Due to how the child passt process was started, the initial
    support for passt (added in 9.0.0) would not see errors
    encountered during startup, so libvirt would continue to setup and
    start the guest; this led to a running guest with no network
    connectivity.

    (NB: On systems that use them, it is still necessary to disable
    SELinux/AppArmor to start passt. This is a temporary limitation,
    and use of the feature in production is strongly discouraged
    until it has been lifted.)
  + qemu: Fix error when attempting to change media in a CDROM drive

    Due to a logic bug introduced in libvirt-9.0 attempts to change media in a
    CDROM would previously fail with an error stating that the tray isn't open.
  + qemu: Properly handle block job transitions

    Starting with libvirt-9.0 the block job state machine improperly handled
    some job transitions, which resulted into some block jobs not being
    properly terminated. This could cause problems such as errors when
    detaching a disk after snapshot.
  + virsh: Make domif-setlink work more than once

    There was a bug introduced in the previous release which made virsh domif-setlink work exactly once over given domain. The bug was fixed and
    now the command can be run multiple times.
  + qemu: Make domain startup fail if NIC already exists

    When starting a domain with an <interface/> that's supposed to be
    managed by libvirt (managed='yes') but corresponding TAP device already
    exists, report an error and make the startup process fail.
  + qemu: Deal with nested mounts when umount()-ing /dev

    When setting up private /dev for a domain (also known as namespaces
    in qemu.conf), libvirt preserves mount points nested under /dev
    (e.g. /dev/shm, /dev/pts and so on). But there was a bug which
    resulted in inability to construct the namespace when there were two or
    more filesystems mounted on the same path. This is common scenario with
    containers and thus the bug was fixed.
  + remote: Pass mode and socket URI parameters to virt-ssh-helper

    When connecting to a remote host using SSH transport, ?mode= and
    ?socket= URI parameters were ignored. This prevented users from
    connecting to a monolithic daemon running on a remote host.
  + qemu: Various swtpm related fixes

    There are more cleanups and small bug fixes with regards to emulated
    <tpm/>. For instance with migration when the swtpm state is on a
    shared volume, or seclabel setting/restoring.

# v9.0.0 (2023-01-16)[¶](#v9-0-0-2023-01-16 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + QEMU: implement external snapshot deletion

    External snapshot deletion is now possible using the existing API
    virDomainSnapshotDelete(). Flags that allow deleting children
    or children only are not supported.
  + QEMU: support passt (<https://passt.top>)

    passt can be used to connect an emulated network device to the
    host's network without requiring libvirt to have any sort of
    elevated privileges. This is configured with:

    ```
    <interface type='user'>
      <backend type='passt'>
      ...
    ```
  + QEMU: add external backend for swtpm

    Connecting the VM to a swtpm daemon started outside of libvirt
    is now possible.
  + QEMU: Support for passing FDs instead of opening files for <disk>

    A new API virDomainFDAssociate gives the users the option to pass FDs
    to libvirt and then use them when starting a VM. Currently the FDs can
    be used instead of directly opening files as <disk> backend.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Prefer PNG for domain screenshots

    With sufficiently new QEMU (v7.1.0) screenshots change format from PPM to PNG.
  + tools: Fix install\_mode for some scripts

    Scripts from the following list were installed with group write bit set:
    virt-xml-validate, virt-pki-validate, virt-sanlock-cleanup,
    libvirt-guests.sh. This was changed so that only the owner is able to write
    them.
  + qemu: Allow multiple nodes for preferred policy

    Due to restrictions of old kernels and libnuma APIs, the preferred NUMA
    policy accepted just a single host NUMA node. With recent enough kernel
    (v5.15.0) and libnuma (v2.0.15) it's possible to set multiple nodes.
  + secret: Inhibit shutdown of daemon for ephemeral secrets

    When an ephemeral secret is defined then automatic shutdown of virtsecretd
    is inhibited. This is to avoid ephemeral secrets disappearing shortly
    before their use.
  + qemu: Report Hyper-V Enlightenments in domcapabilities

    The supported Hyper-V Enlightenments are now reported in domain
    capabilities XML.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Fix NULL-pointer dereference virXMLPropStringRequired

    Fix a bug where when parsing a XML property which is required to be present
    by using virXMLPropStringRequired the parser will crash instead of
    reporting an error.
  + qemu: Init ext devices paths on reconnect

    Paths for external devices are not stored in the status XML. Therefore,
    when the daemon restarted and was reconnecting to a running domain, these
    paths were left blank which led to the daemon crash.
  + qemu: Validate arguments passed to virConnectGetDomainCapabilities

    There was a code path in which insufficient validation of input arguments
    of virConnectGetDomainCapabilities API was possible which led to the
    daemon crash. This path is now fixed.

# v8.10.0 (2022-12-01)[¶](#v8-10-0-2022-12-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Tool for validating SEV firmware boot measurement of QEMU VMs

    The virt-qemu-sev-validate program will compare a reported SEV/SEV-ES
    domain launch measurement, to a computed launch measurement. This
    determines whether the domain has been tampered with during launch.
  + Support for SGX EPC (enclave page cache)

    Users can add a <memory model='sgx-epc'> device to launch a VM with
    Intel Software Guard Extensions.
  + Support migration of vTPM state of QEMU vms on shared storage

    Pass --migration option if appropriate in order for swtpm to
    properly migrate on shared storage.
* **Improvements**

  + Mark close callback (un-)register API as high priority

    High priority APIs use a separate thread pool thus can help in eliminating
    problems with stuck VMs. Marking the close callback API as high priority
    allows virsh to properly connect to the daemon in case the normal
    priority workers are stuck allowing other high priority API usage.
  + Updated x86 CPU features

    The following features for the x86 platform were added:
    v-vmsave-vmload, vgif, avx512-vp2intersect, avx512-fp16,
    serialize, tsx-ldtrk, arch-lbr, xfd, intel-pt-lip,
    avic, sgx, sgxlc, sgx-exinfo, sgx1, sgx2,
    sgx-debug, sgx-mode64, sgx-provisionkey, sgx-tokenkey,
    sgx-kss, bus-lock-detect, pks, amx.
  + Add support for hv-avic Hyper-V enlightenment

    qemu-6.2 introduced support for the hv-avic enlightenment which
    allows to use Hyper-V SynIC with hardware APICv/AVIC enabled.
  + qemu: Run memory preallocation with numa-pinned threads

    Run the thread allocating memory in the proper NUMA node to reduce overhead.
  + RPM packaging changes

    - add optional dependency of libvirt-daemon on libvirt-client

      The libvirt-guests. tool requires the virsh client to work
      properly, but we don't want to require the installation of the daemon
      if the tool is not used.
    - relax required python3-libvirt version for libvirt-client-qemu

      The virt-qemu-qmp-proxy tool requires python but doesn't strictly
      need the newest version. Remove the strict versioning requirement in
      order to prevent cyclic dependency when building.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Skip initialization of cache capabilities if host doesn't support them

    Hypervisor drivers would fail to initialize on aarch64 hosts with
    following error

    ```
    virStateInitialize:657 : Initialisation of cloud-hypervisor state driver failed: no error
    ```

    which prevented the startup of the daemon.
  + Allow incoming connections to guests on routed networks w/firewalld

    A change in handling of implicit rules in firewalld 1.0.0 broke
    incoming connections to VMs when using routed network. This is fixed
    by adding a new libvirt-routed zone configured to once again allow
    incoming sessions to guests on routed networks.
  + Fix infinite loop in nodedev driver

    Certain udev entries might be of a size that makes libudev emit EINVAL
    which caused a busy loop burning CPU. Fix it by ignoring the return code.

# v8.9.0 (2022-11-01)[¶](#v8-9-0-2022-11-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Add virt-qemu-qmp-proxy for emulating a QMP socket for libvirt managed VMs

    virt-qemu-qmp-proxy tool provides a way to expose an emulated QMP server
    socket for a VM managed by libvirt. This allows existing QMP-only clients
    to work with libvirt managed VMs.

    **Note:** libvirt is not interpreting the communication between the tool
    using the proxy and qemu itself, so any state-changing commands may
    desynchronize libvirt. Use at your own risk.
  + qemu: Core Scheduling support

    To avoid side channel attacks, the Linux kernel allows creating groups of
    processes that trust each other and thus can be scheduled to run on
    hyperthreads of a CPU core at the same time. This is now implemented for
    QEMU domains too (see sched\_core knob in qemu.conf), although not
    enabled by default, just yet.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Add hypervisor-specific statistics to virConnectGetAllDomainStats

    The new stats group VIR\_DOMAIN\_STATS\_VM of
    virConnectGetAllDomainStats, also exposed as virsh domstats --vm,
    returns hypervisor-specific stats fields for given VM.
  + Add vendor attribute for CPU models in domain capabilities

    Users can now see the vendor of each CPU model in domain capabilities and
    use it, e.g., for filtering usable CPU models based on host CPU vendor.
  + virsh: Add --model option for hypervisor-cpu-baseline

    This is a shortcut for calling hypervisor-cpu-baseline with a single
    CPU model and no additional features. It can be used for determining which
    features block a particular CPU model from being usable.
  + Improved documentation of CPU usable attribute in domain capabilities
  + Report channel and redirdev devices in domain capabilities

    The channel and redirect devices supported by the hypervisor are now
    reported in domain capabilities.
  + meson: Bump minimal required meson version

    Newer meson versions deprecate some functions used. These were replaced
    with their newer counterparts and the minimal required mesion version was
    bumped to 0.56.0.
  + qemu: Add flags to keep or remove TPM state for virDomainUndefineFlags

    VIR\_DOMAIN\_UNDEFINE\_TPM and VIR\_DOMAIN\_UNDEFINE\_KEEP\_TPM specify
    accordingly to delete or keep a TPM's persistent state directory structure
    and files when undefining a domain. In virsh the flags are exposed as
    --tpm and --keep-tpm for the sub-command undefine.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Disable all blocker features in CPU baseline

    Three years ago QEMU renamed some CPU features (mostly those containing
    an underscore). When such renamed feature was reported by QEMU as blocking
    usability of a CPU model, we would fail to explicitly disable it when
    creating a baseline CPU definition using this model. This bug did not have
    any functional impact when the default check='partial' attribute was
    used for guest CPU definition in domain XML, but it could have caused
    failures to start a domain with check='full' in some cases.
  + qemu: Do not crash after restart with active migration

    In 8.8.0 release libvirt daemon would crash after it was restarted during
    an active outgoing migration.
  + qemu: Refresh state after restore from a save image

    When a domain is restored from a saved image, libvirt now queries QEMU for
    those parts of runtime information that were not part of the save image.
    For instance: MAC address of a macvtap NICs, tray state of CD-ROMs,
    allocated size of virtio-mem, and others.

# v8.8.0 (2022-10-03)[¶](#v8-8-0-2022-10-03 "Link to this headline")

* **Removed features**

  + storage: Remove 'sheepdog' storage driver backend

    The 'sheepdog' project is no longer maintained and upstream bug reports
    are unaddressed. Libvirt thus removed the support for the sheepdog storage
    driver backend, following qemu's removal of sheepdog support in qemu-6.1.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Implement VIR\_DOMAIN\_STATS\_CPU\_TOTAL for qemu:///session

    Users can now query VIR\_DOMAIN\_STATS\_CPU\_TOTAL (also known as cpu.time)
    statistics for session domains.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix non-shared storage migration setup

    This release fixes a bug in setup of a migration with non-shared storage
    ( virsh migrate --copy-storage-all) which was broken by a refactor of
    the code in libvirt-8.7.
  + selinux: Don't ignore NVMe disks when setting image label

    Libvirt did not set any SELinux label on NVMe disks and relied only on the
    default SELinux policy. This turned out to cause problem when using
    namespace or altered policy and thus is fixed now.
  + qemu: Fix a deadlock when setting up namespace

    When starting a domain, libvirt creates a mount namespace and manages
    private /dev with only a handful nodes exposed. But when creating those a
    deadlock inside glib might have occurred. The code was changed so that
    libvirt does not tickle the glib bug.
  + qemu: Don't build memory paths on daemon restart

    When the daemon is restarted it tried to create domain private paths for
    each mounted hugetlbfs. When this failed, the corresponding domain was
    killed. This operation is now performed during domain startup and memory
    hotplug and no longer leads to sudden kill of the domain.

# v8.7.0 (2022-09-01)[¶](#v8-7-0-2022-09-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Removed features**

  + qemu: Remove support for QEMU < 4.2

    In accordance with our platform support policy, the oldest supported QEMU
    version is now bumped from 3.1 to 4.2.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for specifying vCPU physical address size in bits

    Users can now specify the number of vCPU physical address bits with
    the <maxphysaddr> subelement of the <cpu> element.
* **Improvements**

  + esx: Domain XMLs can now be dumped for VMs with two new interface types

    One is when the interface is not connected anywhere type='null' and one
    when it is connected to VMWare Distributed Switch type='vds'.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: increase memlock limit for a domain with multiple vfio/vdpa devices

    When multiple vfio or vdpa devices are assigned to a domain, the locked
    memory limit could be too low to map memory for all devices. The memlock
    limit has been increased to be proportional to the number of vdpa/vfio
    devices.

# v8.6.0 (2022-08-01)[¶](#v8-6-0-2022-08-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Improvements**

  + conf: Improved firmware autoselection

    The firmware autoselection feature now behaves more intuitively, reports
    better error messages on failure and comes with high-level documentation.

# v8.5.0 (2022-07-01)[¶](#v8-5-0-2022-07-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce support for network backed NVRAM

    Users can now use remote store NVRAM image by specifying newly introduced
    attribute type='network' with <nvram> element.
  + qemu: Add support for post-copy migration recovery

    A new VIR\_MIGRATE\_POSTCOPY\_RESUME flag (virsh migrate --postcopy-resume)
    was introduced for recovering from a failed post-copy migration.
  + qemu: Add support for zero-copy migration

    With QEMU 7.1.0, libvirt can enable zerocopy for parallel migration. This
    is implemented by adding a new VIR\_MIGRATE\_ZEROCOPY flag(virsh migrate --zerocopy).
  + Introduce thread\_pool\_min and thread\_pool\_max attributes to IOThread

    New attributes thread\_pool\_min and thread\_pool\_max were introduced
    to <iothread/> as well as new <defaultiothread/> element with the
    same attributes. This way it's possible to instruct QEMU to spawn enough
    worker threads for an IOThread upfront, resulting in predictable time
    needed to process an I/O request.
* **Improvements**

  + Define a TFTP server without a DHCP server in network configuration

    It's now possible to define a network with no DHCP server but with a TFTP
    server. This may be useful when DHCP service is provided by other entity on
    the network than libvirt spawned dnsmasq.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Restore label to temp file in qemuDomainScreenshot()

    When virDomainScreenshot() is called, libvirt instructs QEMU to save the
    screenshot into a temporary file. This file needs to be labelled correctly,
    so that QEMU can access it. And since the file is temporary (it's deleted
    after the screenshot was taken) the corresponding label restore was
    missing. This proven to be problematic for profile based models, like
    AppArmor, where the temporary files were added into the profile but never
    removed, which resulted in longer profile recalculation times.
  + qemuBuildInterfaceConnect: Initialize @tapfd array

    Due to an uninitialized array, unsuccessful attempt to start a guest with
    an <interface/> might have resulted in closing of a random FD and thus
    sudden disconnect of a client or other random failures.
  + qemu: Fix hotplug of network interfaces

    A logic bug introduced in a recent refactor was fixed. The bug caused a
    problem when hot-adding a network interface, which failed with the
    following error:

    ```
    error: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'netdev_add': File descriptor named '(null)' has not been found
    ```
  + Fix startupPolicy validation for block disks

    Setting of startupPolicy for a block disk would result in an error due
    to a logic bug in a recent refactor.
  + qemu: Fix crash when overriding device properties via <qemu:override> element

    Adding an override for a device property would result in a crash of the qemu
    driver.

# v8.4.0 (2022-06-01)[¶](#v8-4-0-2022-06-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: D-Bus display

    Libvirt is now able to setup a D-Bus display export, either with a private
    bus or in p2p mode. This display is available in QEMU 7.0.0.
  + qemu: ppc64 Power10 processor support

    Support for the recently released IBM Power10 processor was added.
  + qemu: Introduce absolute clock offset

    The absolute clock offset type allows to set the guest clock to an
    arbitrary epoch timestamp at each start. This is useful if some VM needs
    to be kept set to an arbitrary time for e.g. testing or working around
    broken software.
  + qemu: add qemu-vdagent channel

    This paravirtualized qemu vdagent channel can enable copy and paste between
    a guest and a VNC client. It is available in QEMU 6.1.0.
  + api: Add new APIs virDomainSaveParams and virDomainRestoreParams

    - virDomainSaveParams: An alternative domain saving API, extends
      virDomainSaveFlags by adding parameters.
    - virDomainRestoreParams: An alternative domain restoring API, extends
      virDomainRestoreFlags by adding parameters.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Improve heuristics for computing baseline CPU models

    Both virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU and virConnectBaselineCPU were
    in some cases computing the result using a CPU model which was newer than
    some of the input models. For example, Cascadelake-Server was used as a
    baseline for Skylake-Server-IBRS and Cascadelake-Server. The CPU
    model selection heuristics was improved to choose a more appropriate model.

# v8.3.0 (2022-05-02)[¶](#v8-3-0-2022-05-02 "Link to this headline")

* **Removed features**

  + qemu: Remove support for QEMU < 3.1

    In accordance with our platform support policy, the oldest supported QEMU
    version is now bumped from 2.11 to 3.1.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce support for virtio-iommu

    This IOMMU device can be used with both Q35 and ARM virt guests.
  + qemu: Introduce attributes rss and rss\_hash\_report for net interface

    They can enable in-qemu/ebpf RSS and in-qemu RSS hash report for virtio NIC.
    Require QEMU >= 5.1.

# v8.2.0 (2022-04-01)[¶](#v8-2-0-2022-04-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce manual disk snapshot mode

    This new mode allows users to synchronize libvirt snapshots with snapshots
    which need to be done outside of libvirt e.g. when 'vhost-user-blk' is used
    to back the disk.
  + Introduce memory allocation threads

    When starting a QEMU guest, libvirt can now instruct QEMU to allocate
    guest's memory in parallel. This may be handy when guest has large amounts
    of memory.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: VIR\_MIGRATE\_PARAM\_TLS\_DESTINATION now works with non-shared storage migration

    The setting now also applies to the NBD connections for non-shared storage
    migration allowing migration to proceed even when the user expects certificate
    name not to match.
  + qemu: Allow overrides of device properties via the qemu namespace

    Users wishing to override or modify properties of devices configured by
    libvirt can use the <qemu:deviceOverride> QEMU namespace element to
    specify the overrides instead of relying on the argv passthrough of the
    -set qemu commandline option which no longer works with new qemu.
  + qemu: Allow passing file descriptors to virsh qemu-monitor-command

    Passing FDs allows users wanting to experiment with qemu driven by libvirt
    use commands like add-fd properly.
  + libxl: Turn on user aliases

    Users can now use so called user aliases for XEN domains.
  + Implement support for FUSE3

    The LXC driver uses fuse to overwrite some lines in /proc/meminfo
    inside containers so that they see correct amount of memory given to them.
    The code was changed so that both fuse and fuse3 are supported.
  + Improve domain save/restore throughput

    Code that's handling save or restore of QEMU domains was changed resulting
    in better performance of I/O and thus shortening time needed for the operation.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Both build and tests should now pass on Alpine Linux or any other
    distribution with musl libc.
  + virsh: Fix integer overflow in allocpages

    On hosts which support hugepages larger than 1GiB virsh allocpages
    failed to accept them because of an integer overflow. This is now fixed.
  + qemu: Fix segmentation fault in virDomainUndefineFlags

    When a domain without any <loader/> was being undefined, libvirt has
    crashed. This is now fixed.
  + lxc: Fix unaligned reads of /proc/meminfo within a container

    When /proc/meminfo was read in chunks smaller than the entire file, libvirt
    would produce mangled output. While porting the code to FUSE3 this area was
    reworked and the file can now be read with any granularity.
  + qemu: Be less aggressive around cgroup\_device\_acl

    A basic set of devices common to every domain can be set in qemu.conf
    via cgroup\_device\_acl knob. Devices from this set are allowed in CGroup and
    created in domain private namespace for every domain. However, upon device
    hotunplug it may have had happened that libvirt mistakenly denied a device
    from this set and/or removed it from the namespace. For instance,
    /dev/urandom was removed and denied in CGroup on RNG hotunplug.
  + nodedev: trigger mdev device definition update on udev add and remove

    When nodedev objects are added and removed mdev device definitions are
    updated to report correct associated parent.

# v8.1.0 (2022-03-01)[¶](#v8-1-0-2022-03-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add hvf domain type for Hypervisor.framework

    It works on Intel machines as well as recent machines powered by Apple
    Silicon. QEMU 6.2.0 is needed for Apple Silicon support.
  + qemu: Support mode option for dirtyrate calculation

    Introduce virDomainDirtyRateCalcFlags as parameter of
    virDomainStartDirtyRateCalc, which is used to specify the mode of
    dirty page rate calculation.

    Add --mode option to virsh domdirtyrate-calc, which can be
    either of the following 3 options:
    page-sampling, dirty-bitmap, dirty-ring.

    Add calc\_mode field for dirtyrate statistics returned by
    virsh domstats --dirtyrate, also add vCPU dirtyrate if
    dirty-ring mode was used in last measurement.
* **Improvements**

  + packaging: sysconfig files no longer installed

    libvirt used to provide defaults in various /etc/sysconfig/ files, such
    as /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd. Since these files are owned by the admin, this
    made it difficult to change built-in defaults in case such file was
    modified by the admin. The built-in defaults are now part of the provided
    systemd unit files, such as libvirtd.service. These unit files continue
    to parse sysconfig files, in case they are created by the admin and filled
    with the desired key=value pairs.
  + virnetdev: Ignore EPERM on implicit clearing of VF VLAN ID

    Libvirt will now ignore EPERM errors on attempts to implicitly clear a
    VLAN ID (when a VLAN is not explicitly provided via an interface XML
    using a 0 or a non-zero value) as SmartNIC DPUs do not expose VLAN
    programming capabilities to the hypervisor host. This allows Libvirt
    clients to avoid specifying a VLAN and expect VF configuration to work
    since Libvirt tries to clear a VLAN in the same operation
    as setting a MAC address for VIR\_DOMAIN\_NET\_TYPE\_HOSTDEV devices which
    is now split into two distinct operations. EPERM errors received while
    trying to program a non-zero VLAN ID or explicitly program a VLAN ID 0
    will still cause errors as before so there is no change in behavior
    in those cases.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Remove unix sockets from filesystem when disabling a '.socket' systemd unit

    The presence of the socket files is used by our remote driver to determine
    which service to access. Since neither systemd nor the daemons clean up the
    socket file clients were running into problems when a modular deployment was
    switched to monolithic libvirtd.
  + qemu: Fixes of fd passing during hotplug and hotunplug of chardevs

    FDs used as chardev backing are now properly removed when hot-unplugging
    a chardev from qemu and hotplugged chardevs now properly use virtlogd
    to handle the input and output from qemu.
  + RPM: Run pre/post-install steps on daemon-driver-storage-core

    Previously the pre/post-install code was part of the meta-package which
    installed all storage driver sub-packages thus a minimalistic install
    of the storage driver didn't behave correctly.

  + libxl: Fix potential deadlock and crash (CVE-2021-4147)

    A rogue guest could continuously reboot itself and cause libvirtd on the
    host to deadlock or crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
* **Removed features**

  + qemu: Explicitly forbid live changing nodeset for strict numatune

    For strict mode of <numatune/> it can't be guaranteed that memory is
    moved completely onto new set of nodes (e.g. QEMU might have locked pieces
    of its memory) thus breaking the strict promise. If live migration of QEMU
    memory between NUMA nodes is desired, users are advised to use
    restrictive mode instead.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Synchronous write mode for disk copy operations

    The blockdev-mirror block job supports a mode where writes from the VM
    are synchronously propagated to the destination of the copy. This ensures
    that the job will converge under heavy I/O.

    Implement the mode for the copy blockjob as
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_COPY\_SYNCHRONOUS\_WRITES flag exposed via
    virsh blockcopy --synchronous-writes and for non-shared storage migration
    as VIR\_MIGRATE\_NON\_SHARED\_SYNCHRONOUS\_WRITES exposed via
    virsh migrate --copy-storage-synchronous-writes.
  + Introduce TCG domain features

    Libvirt is now able to set the size of translation block cache size
    (tb-size) for TCG domains.
  + qemu: Add new API to inject a launch secret in a domain

    New API virDomainSetLaunchSecurityState() and virsh command
    domsetlaunchsecstate are added to support injecting a launch secret
    in a domain's memory.
* **Improvements**

  + libxl: Implement the virDomainGetMessages API
  + qemu: Preserve qcow2 sub-cluster allocation state after external snapshots and block-copy

    The new image which is installed as an overlay on top of the current chain
    when taking an external snapshot, or the target of a block copy operation
    now enables sub-cluster allocation (extended\_l2) if the original
    image has the option enabled.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix device hot-unplug with libvirt-7.9 or libvirt-7.10 used with qemu-6.2

    An internal change to the configuration format used by the above libvirt
    versions triggers a bug in qemu-6.2 where qemu no longer emits the
    event notifying that the device was unplugged successfully and thus libvirt
    never removes the device from the definition.

    This impacts only devices which were present at startup of the VM, hotplugged
    devices behave correctly.

    This is fixed in libvirt-8.0 by reverting to the old configuration
    approach until qemu is fixed.

    As a workaround for libvirt-7.9 and libvirt-7.10 the old configuration
    approach can be forced by:

    Option 1, global qemu.conf:

    ```
    capability_filters = [ "device.json" ]
    ```

    Option 2, per VM XML override:

    ```
    <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>

     [...]

     <qemu:capabilities>
       <qemu:del capability='device.json'/>
     </qemu:capabilities>
    </domain>
    ```
  + Fix sparse streams with split daemon

    In split daemon scenario, a client connected to a hypervisor driver and
    using sparse streams (e.g. virsh vol-download --sparse) would make the
    hypervisor daemon enter an infinite loop without any data transfer. This is
    now fixed.
  + Build no longer requires RPC library

    Code and its cross dependencies were fixed so that build without remote
    driver and thus an RPC library (like tirpc) fails no more.
  + virnetdevopenvswitch: Fix 'burst' value passed to ovs-vsctl

    When a <bandwidth/> was defined for a TAP device that's plugged into an
    OvS bridge values passed to the OvS were incorrectly recalculated resulting
    in slightly different limits being applied.

# v7.10.0 (2021-12-01)[¶](#v7-10-0-2021-12-01 "Link to this headline")

    This binary helps users figure out the format of Distinguished Name
    from a certificate file the way that libvirt expects it in
    tls\_allowed\_dn\_list option of libvirtd.conf configuration file
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Report guest interface information in virDomainGetGuestInfo

    Libvirt is now able to report interface information from the guest's
    perspective (using guest agent).
  + qemu: detect guest side errors during device removal

    Libvirt is now able to detect guest side errors during device removal by
    using the DEVICE\_UNPLUG\_GUEST\_ERROR event, available in QEMU 6.2.0.
  + Minimum SSF setting

    The libvirtd.conf option tcp\_min\_ssf can be used to override the minimum
    permitted security strength factor for non-TLS remote connections.
    The current hardcoded minimum is 56 (single-DES) and will be raised to 112
    in the future. Setting a minimum lower than 112 is not supported.
  + qemu: Report stats also for block copy destination and backup job scratch
    images

    The statistics are available via the bulk domain stats API.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Don't format 'ramfb' attribute when disabled

    Fix a regression caused by the conversion to JSON -device arguments where
    'ramfb' would be put on the commandline of 'vfio-pci' which doesn't have it,
    thus breaking VMs with a mediated host device.
  + qemu: Fix block copy and backup to encrypted storage

    An oversight in last release lead to a spurious error being reported when
    encrypted storage was requested for disk images which are not directly
    backing the disk, which is now fixed.

# v7.9.0 (2021-11-01)[¶](#v7-9-0-2021-11-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Introduce virtio-mem <memory/> model

    New virtio-mem model is introduced for <memory/> device which is a
    paravirtualized mechanism of adding/removing memory to/from a VM. Use
    virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags() API to adjust amount of memory or virsh update-memory-device for convenience.
  + qemu: support disabling hotplug of devices on the pci-root controller

    the <target hotplug='on|off'/> option is now supported for the
    pci-root controller on i440fx-based (x86 "pc") machinetypes. This
    can be used to disable hotplug/unplug of devices from this
    controller. The default behavior is unchanged (hotplug is
    allowed).
  + Support hotplug and hotunplug for virtiofs

    Filesystems backed by virtiofsd can now be hotplugged and hotunplugged.
  + virpcivpd: Add a PCI VPD parser

    A parser for the standard PCI/PCIe VPD ("I.3. VPD Definitions" in PCI 2.2+
    and an equivalent definition in "6.28.1 VPD Format" PCIe 4.0) was added
    along with relevant types to represent PCI VPD in memory. This
    functionality got added for Linux only at this point (kernels above
    v2.6.26 have support for exposing VPD via sysfs).
  + virpci: Add PCI VPD-related helper functions to virpci

    In order to utilize the PCI VPD parser, a couple of helper functions got
    introduced to check for the presence of a VPD file in the sysfs tree and
    to invoke the PCI VPD parser to get a list of resources representing PCI
    VPD contents in memory.
  + nodedev: Add PCI VPD capability support

    Support for serializing and deserializing PCI VPD data structures is added
    following the addition of the PCI VPD parser. A new PCI device capability
    called "vpd" is introduced holding string resources and keyword resources
    found in PCI VPD.
  + qemu: Support page\_per\_vq for driver element

    This optional virtio attribute page\_per\_vq controls the layout of the
    notification capabilities exposed to the guest. It is recommended for the
    vDPA devices.
  + qemu: Support librbd encryption

    Add an encryption engine librbd. It will provides the image-level
    encryption of librbd. It requires QEMU >= 6.1.0 and librbd >= 16.1.0.
* **Improvements**

  + Use of JSON syntax with -device with upcoming QEMU-6.2

    Libvirt started using JSON directly with the -device commandline
    parameter as it's considered the preferred stable syntax for further QEMU
    releases. If any problems with the conversion are encountered please
    report them as soon as possible.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix problems on virsh domstats with qemu <5.2.0

    Libvirt v7.2.0 and later called query-dirty-rate, which was introduced in
    qemu-5.2.0, regardless of qemu version and failed in qemu-5.1.0. This
    release fixes the bug.

# v7.8.0 (2021-10-01)[¶](#v7-8-0-2021-10-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + nodedev: Add ability to automatically start mediated devices

    The autostart status of a persistent mediated devices can be managed with
    the new APIs virNodeDeviceSetAutostart() and
    virNodeDeviceGetAutostart(). The corresponding virsh command is
    nodedev-autostart. In addition, two new APIs were added to get
    additional information about node devices: virNodeDeviceIsPersistent()
    checks whether the device is persistently defined, and
    virNodeDeviceIsActive() checks whether the node device is currently
    active. This information can also be retrieved with the new virsh command
    nodedev-info.
  + qemu: Add attribute queue\_size for virtio-blk devices
* **Improvements**

  + api: Add XML validation for creating of: networkport, nwfilter-binding,

    - Add flag VIR\_NETWORK\_PORT\_CREATE\_VALIDATE to validate network port
      input xml of network-port creating.
    - Add flag VIR\_NETWORK\_CREATE\_VALIDATE to validate network input xml of
      network creating.
    - Add flag VIR\_NWFILTER\_BINDING\_CREATE\_VALIDATE to validate
      nwfilter-binding input xml of nwfilter-binding creating.

# v7.7.0 (2021-09-01)[¶](#v7-7-0-2021-09-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Add support for Fibre Channel VMID

    New VM element <fibrechannel appid=''/> was added to allow users to set
    their appid for each VM which will be used by kernel to create Fibre
    Channel VMID. This allows various QoS levels, access control or collecting
    telemetry data per VM.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Allow XML validation for define of: storage pool, network, secret,
    nwfilter, interface

    - Add flag VIR\_STORAGE\_POOL\_DEFINE\_VALIDATE to validate storage pool
      input xml. For virsh, users can use it as virsh pool-define --validate.
    - Add flag VIR\_NETWORK\_DEFINE\_VALIDATE to validate network input xml. For
      virsh, users can use it as net-define --validate.
    - Add flag VIR\_SECRET\_DEFINE\_VALIDATE to validate secret input xml. For
      virsh, users can use it as secret-define --validate.
    - Add flag VIR\_NWFILTER\_DEFINE\_VALIDATE to validate nwfilter input xml.
      For virsh, users can use it as nwfilter-define --validate.
    - Add flag VIR\_INTERFACE\_DEFINE\_VALIDATE to validate interface input xml.
      For virsh, users can use it as iface-define --validate.
  + Add SecurityManager APIs for labeling network devices

    New virSecurityManagerSetNetdevLabel and virSecurityManagerSetNetdevLabel
    APIs are introduced and implemented in the Apparmor security driver.
    The qemu driver uses the APIs to label vhostuser ports on hotplug and
    restore labeling on unplug.
  + vmx: Parse vm.genid and support super wide SCSI bus

    The genid attribute is now reported for VMX guests. Libvirt can now
    properly process super wide SCSI bus (64 units).
  + qemu: Lifecycle action (on\_poweroff/on\_reboot) handling improvements

    The handling of lifecycle actions was fixed and improved in multiple ways:

    - restart-rename action was forbidden

      The action was never properly implemented in the qemu driver and didn't
      actually result in a restart of the VM but rather termination. The qemu
      driver now rejects such configurations.
    - preserve action was forbidden

      Similarly to the previous case this never worked as the intended semantics
      of the actions dictate. It's better to not allow it at all until there's a
      proper implementation
    - reboot action of on\_poweroff now actually works

      The guest OS is now rebooted instead of terminating the VM when the
      reboot action is used and the guest OS powers down. Note that it's
      incompatible with on\_reboot set to destroy.
    - Changes in action action of on\_reboot are now updated with qemu

      Libvirtd can now properly update the on\_reboot action in qemu which
      allows proper handling when changing between reboot and destroy
      actions. In addition, switching from reboot to destroy was
      forbidden for older qemus which don't support the update API as the guest
      could still reboot and execute some instructions until it was terminated.
  + virsh: Support vhostuser in attach-interface
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Open chardev logfile on behalf of QEMU

    Guests with a logfile configured for their chardevs are now able to start
    even when no virtlogd is configured.
  + virhostmem: Handle numactl-less build in hugepages allocation/reporting

    Some architectures don't have notion of NUMA (e.g. s390x) but do support
    hugepages. Libvirt silently ignored requests to allocate/report hugepage
    pool when built without numactl. This is now fixed and the pool can be
    allocated/reported on properly.
  + qemu: Record proper backing format for overlays of qcow2+luks images

    Libvirt would record luks instead of qcow2 into the metadata. In
    practice this is a problem only when inspecting images manually via
    qemu-img as with libvirt users must use full specification of the
    backing chain in the domain XML which supersedes information recorded in
    the image metadata.

    deprive legitimate users access to a storage pool object by users who don't
    have access.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Incremental backup support via virDomainBackupBegin

    libvirt-7.6 along with the unreleased qemu-6.1 will fully support the change
    block tracking features (block-dirty-bitmaps) to be able to do incremental
    backups and management of the checkpoint states via the appropriate APIs.
  + qemu: Add support for launch security type s390-pv

    Specifying s390-pv as launch security type in an s390 domain prepares for
    running the guest in protected virtualization secure mode, also known as
    IBM Secure Execution. This simplifies the definition and reduces the risk
    of an incorrect definition, e.g. by forgetting to specify iommu=on on
    all virtio devices.
  + domstats: Add haltpolling time statistic interface

    Domstats now provide the data of cpu haltpolling time. This feature relies
    on statistics available after kernel version 5.8. This will allow the user
    to get more accurate CPU usage information if needed.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix migration with VIR\_MIGRATE\_NON\_SHARED\_INC

    libvirt 7.3.0 introduced a bug where VIR\_MIGRATE\_NON\_SHARED\_INC would
    not actually migrate the contents of the disk due to broken logic and at
    the same time could trigger migration of storage when
    VIR\_MIGRATE\_TUNNELLED is requested. This release fixes the bug.
  + qemu: Don't emit VIR\_DOMAIN\_EVENT\_ID\_BLOCK\_THRESHOLD twice when registered with index

    When registering the threshold event with the index notation (e.g.
    vda[3]) libvirt would emit the event also for vda if the image is
    in the top layer. The intention was to emit two events only when the
    original registration was done without the index.
  + qemu: Pass discard requests for disks with copy\_on\_read='on'

    When a disk using the copy\_on\_read='on' option is configured also with
    discard='unmap' the discard requests will now be passed to the
    underlying image freeing up the space.

  + docs: Document disk serial truncation status quo

    Disk <serial> is being truncated by QEMU before passed to the guest.
    Since it's impossible to fix it without running into further regressions
    the documentation was improved to document the intricacies.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fixed validation of disk iothread configuration

    The validation of iothread config was previously moved to a place where
    it caused bogus errors when address wasn't allocated when hotplugging a
    disk. The check is now removed as it wasn't actually necessary at all.

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for hotplugging <transient/> disks

    The disk hotplug code in the qemu driver now can handle hotplug of disks
    with automatically added overlay.
  + qemu: Add support for sharing base image of <transient/> disks

    Users can use <transient shareBacking='yes'/> to tell the qemu driver to
    never open the base image in write mode thus multiple VMs can share the
    same image. Note that the disk will be hotplugged during startup.
* **Improvements**

  + Add win-dmp crashdump format

    New win-dmp format for virDomainCoreDumpWithFormat API and/or virsh
    dump --format was introduced.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Allow 0 offset in XML schema for <slice type='storage' offset='0' size='321'/>

    Having a 0 offset so that the size of the image can be limited is a

    The xen driver now supports domains with more than 4TB of memory with
    xen >= 4.13.
  + qemu: add socket for virtiofs filesystems

    Libvirt now supports filesystem devices that connect to
    a virtiofsd daemon launched outside of libvirtd, via the
    socket attribute of the source element.
  + nodedev: Add ability to manage persistent mediated devices

    Persistent mediated devices can now be managed with libvirt.
    virNodeDeviceDefineXML() defines a new device,
    virNodeDeviceUndefine() removes an existing definition, and
    virNodeDeviceCreate() starts a device definition that is currently
    inactive. Corresponding virsh commands nodedev-define,
    nodedev-undefine, and nodedev-start were also added.
    nodedev-list only lists active devices by default. Inactive device
    definitions can be shown with the new --inactive and --all flags.
  + qemu: Allow use of qemu's -compat option

    Curious developers or testers now can enable certain -compat modes which
    allow to notice use of deprecated commands and options as qemu will use the
    selected method to notify the user. The new behaviour can be requested using
    either the deprecation\_behavior option in qemu.conf for all VMs or
    using <qemu:deprecation behavior='...'/> in the VM XML.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Improve errors with virsh snapshot-create-as

    The XML document constructed by virsh was forced through XML schema
    validation which yielded unintelligible error messages in cases such as
    when the path to the new image did not start with a slash. XML documents
    are no longer validated as the XML parser actually has better error
    messages which allow users to figure the problem out quickly.
  + qemu: Terminate backing store when doing a full-chain block pull

    When pulling everything into the overlay image the chain can be terminated
    since we know that it won't depend on any backing image and thus can prevent
    attempts to probe the backing chain.
  + qemu: Expose disk serial in virDomainGetGuestInfo()

    The virDomainGetGuestInfo() reports disk serial number among with other
    disk information.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix crash of libvirt on full block pull of a disk

    When the persistent definition contains a compatible disk (meaning the
    definition of the running and persistent config match) a block pull job
    would leave a dangling pointer in the config definition which resulted
    in a crash.
  + qemu: Use proper job cancelling command

    Libvirt's API contract for aborting a block copy job in 'ready' state
    declares that the destination image of the copy will contain a consistent
    image of the disk from the time when the block job was aborted. This
    requires that libvirt uses the proper cancelling qemu command to ensure
    that the data is consistent which was not the case.
  + qemu: Don't attempt storage migration when there are no migratable disks

    Due to a logic bug introduced in the previous release libvirt would attempt
    to migrate disks in case when no disks are selected/eligible for migration.
  + qemu: Fix very rare race when two block job 'ready' events are delivered

    In certain high-load scenarios, qemu might deliver the 'ready' event twice
    and if it's delivered when pivoting to the destination during a block copy
    job, libvirt would get confused and execute the code as if the job were
    aborted.
  + lxc: Fix container destroy with CGroupsV2

    When an LXC container was started and the host used CGroupsV2 it might have
    had created nested controllers under the container's scope. Libvirt was
    unaware and thus destroying the container failed with a cryptic error:
    failed to get cgroup backend for 'pathOfController'. The CGroup removal
    code was reworked and is now capable of dealing with such scenario.
  + bash-completion: Fix argument passing to $1

    Due to a bug in bash completion script, the auto completion did not work
    properly when a connection URI or read only flag were specified on
    virsh or virt-admin command line.

  + qemu: Support reporting memory dirty rate stats

    The memory dirty rate stats can be obtained through virsh domstats --dirtyrate via the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API.
  + qemu: Full disk backups via virDomainBackupBegin

    The qemu hypervisor driver now allows taking full disk backups via the
    virDomainBackupBegin API and the corresponding virsh wrapper.

    In future releases the feature will be extended to also support incremental
    backups (where only the difference since the last backup is copied) when
    qemu adds the required functionality.
  + Add support for audio backend specific settings

    With this release a new <audio/> element is introduced that allows
    users to configure audio output for their guests.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Compatibility with QEMU 6.0 for certain hot-(un)-plug operations

    Libvirt 7.2.0 is required for compatibility with the upcoming QEMU 6.0

    iothreads, chardevs, RNG devices, disks with secret, ...
  + qemu: Various improvements to embedded mode

    Embedded mode for the QEMU driver, as well as the virt-qemu-run tool
    saw improvements in handling of domain life cycle, temporary directories
    creation (important when using disk secrets) and other minor fixes.
  + Documentation of split daemon related config files

    Split daemons read configuration files upon their start. These were never
    documented though.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Check host CPU for forbidden features

    CPU feature policy did not work as expected with host-passthrough and
    features supported by physical host. CPU features were not filtered out
    when @check was set to full.
  + Fix virNetworkUpdate() to work with split daemons

    Due to a bug in our code, virNetworkUpdate() did not work with split daemon
    unless management application connected to virtnetworkd directly.
  + qemu: increase locked memory limit when a vDPA device is present

    Just like VFIO devices, vDPA devices may need to have all guest memory
    pages locked/pinned in order to operate properly. These devices are now
    included when calculating the limit for memory lock.
  + Don't log error if SRIOV PF has no associated netdev

    Some SRIOV PFs don't have a netdev associated with them in which case
    libvirtd reported an error and refused to start. This is now fixed.
  + qemu: Only raise memlock limit if necessary

    Attempting to set the memlock limit might fail if we're running
    in a containerized environment where CAP\_SYS\_RESOURCE is not
    available, and if the limit is already high enough there's no
    point in trying to raise it anyway.
  + Restore security context of swtpm.log

    If a guest with emulated TPM was started and the daemon was restarted
    afterwards, the security context of the per-domain swtpm.log file was
    not restored on domain shutdown leaving it unable to be started again.
  + virtlogd|virtlockd: Fixed crash when upgrading the daemons in-place

    A bug preventing the in-place upgrade of virtlogd and virtlockd
    daemons was fixed, so they can again be upgraded without dropping the log
    file descriptors or locks on files.

# v7.1.0 (2021-03-01)[¶](#v7-1-0-2021-03-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Portability**

  + Implement Apple Silicon support

    libvirt now runs on the ARM-based Apple Silicon Macs.
* **New features**

  + Introduce virtio-pmem <memory/> model

    The virtio-pmem is a virtio variant of NVDIMM and just like NVDIMM
    virtio-pmem also allows accessing host pages bypassing guest page cache.
  + Introduce <boot order/> for <filesystem>

    Booting is possible from virtiofs filesystems. Introduce an option
    to control the boot order, like we do for other bootable devices.
  + hyperv: implement new APIs

    The virDomainUndefine(), virDomainUndefineFlags(),
    virDomainDefineXML(), virDomainAttachDevice(), and
    virDomainAttachDeviceFlags(), virConnectListAllNetworks(),
    virConnectNumOfNetworks(), virNetworkLookupByName(),
    virNetworkLookupByUUID(), virConnectNumOfDefinedNetworks(),
    virConnectListDefinedNetworks(), virNetworkGetAutostart(),
    virNetworkIsActive(), virNetworkIsPersistent(),
    virNetworkGetXMLDesc(), and virDomainScreenshot(), APIs have been
    implemented in the Hyper-V driver.
  + Support <teaming> element in plain <hostdev> devices

    This is useful when libvirt doesn't have the privileges necessary
    to set the hostdev device's MAC address (which is a necessary
    part of the alternate <interface type='hostdev'>).
  + Introduce <disk type='vhostuser'> support

    Introduces support for QEMU vhost-user-blk device that can be used
    to access storage exported via the vhost-user protocol by daemons such
    as the qemu-storage-daemon.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix disk quiescing rollback when creating external snapshots

    If the qemu guest agent call to freeze filesystems failed when creating
    an external snapshot with VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_CREATE\_QUIESCE flag the
    filesystems would be unconditionally thawed. This could cause problems when
    the filesystems were frozen by an explicit call to virDomainFSFreeze
    since the guest agent then rejects any further freeze attempts once are
    filesystems frozen, an explicit freeze followed by a quiesced snapshot
    would fail and thaw filesystems.

    Users are also encouraged to use virDomainFSFreeze/Thaw manually instead
    of relying on VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_CREATE\_QUIESCE if they need finer
    grained control.
  + cgroups: Fix how we setup and configure cgroups on hosts with systemd

    When libvirt is running on host with systemd we register every VM with
    machined which creates the VM root cgroup for us as well. Before this fix
    we were directly modifying files in the VM root cgroup which was incorrect
    because all the files are managed by systemd. The implication was that any
    change done by libvirt to cgroup attributes supported by systemd could be
    removed which happens for example by running systemctl daemon-reload.

    To fix the issue libvirt now uses DBus calls for some of the cgroup
    attributes that distribute the resources proportionally to the cgroup
    siblings and for the rest we have a new sub-cgroup that libvirt can
    managed directly.

    For more details why this is necessary see
    [systemd cgroup](https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/) documentation.
  + qemu: Fix swtpm device with aarch64

    The TPM TIS device name for x86 is tpm-tis, whereas for aarch64 it is
    tpm-tis-device. Fix the use of TPM TIS device with aarch64 by using
    the proper device name when building the QEMU command line.
  + libxl: Fix domain shutdown

    Commit fa30ee04a2 introduced the possibility of a race between the
    shutdown and death threads used to process domain shutdown and death
    events from libxl. On normal domain shutdown the shutdown thread handles
    all aspects of shutting down and cleaning up the domain. The death
    thread is only used to handle out-of-band domain destruction and is
    inhibited when domain shutdown is under libvirt's control. The race is
    avoided by also inhibiting the death thread when libvirt starts the
    shutdown thread.

# v7.0.0 (2021-01-15)[¶](#v7-0-0-2021-01-15 "Link to this headline")

* **Project governance**

  + Formal handover of release tarball signing

    Starting from libvirt-6.6 the release tarballs are signed by Jiří Denemark.
    Releases starting with 7.0 contain a note from the previous maintainer
    Daniel Veillard officially handing over the signing of packages so that the
    transition can be verified.
* **New features**

  + nodedev: Add node device driver support for AP devices

    Add support for detecting and listing Adjunct Processor(AP) cards, AP
    queues and AP matrix devices (which are capable of MDEV) of a KVM host
    system in libvirt node device driver with correct object relationships.
  + qemu: Allow control of qcow2 metadata cache

    In specific usecases such as when massive storage images are used it's
    possible to achieve better performance by increasing the metadata cache
    size. The new knob allows advanced users setting the size according to
    qemu's documentation to suit their image.
  + conf: Add support for keeping TPM emulator state

    Currently, swtpm TPM state file is removed when a transient domain is
    powered off or undefined. Add per-TPM emulator option persistent\_state
    for keeping TPM state.
  + cpu\_map: Add Snowridge CPU model

    It's supported in QEMU 4.1 and newer.
  + qemu: Add support for NFS disk protocol

    Implement support for the 'nfs' native protocol driver in the qemu driver.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Discourage users from polling virDomainGetBlockJobInfo for block
    job completion

    Document that waiting for events is a more robust solution.
  + secret: Relax XML schema for the usage name of a secret

    Various bits of documentation of how to use libvirt with RBD volumes used
    an usage name which would not pass the XML validation. Relax the requirement
    to make such XMLs valid.
  + virnetdevopenvswitch: Various improvements

    The code that handles <interface type='vhostuser'/> was given various
    improvements. So far, libvirt assumed vhostuser interfaces are handled
    exclusively by OpenVSwitch and refused to start a guest if it was not so.
    Now a guest can be started successfully even if the interface is created by
    some other tool (e.g. dpdk-testpmd). Also, the code that detects the
    interface name was adapted to new versions of OpenVSwitch and thus can
    detect name more reliably.
  + qemu: Report guest disks information in virDomainGetGuestInfo

    Libvirt is now able to report disks and filesystems from the guest's
    perspective (using guest agent). And with sufficiently new guest agent
    (5.3.0 or newer) the API also handles disks on CCW bus.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix logic bug in inactive snapshot deletion

    This release fixes a bug introduced in libvirt-6.9 where libvirt's
    snapshot metadata would not be deleted on successful snapshot deletion.
  + qemu: Fix VMs with <iotune> on an empty cdrom

    Specifying <iotune> for an empty cdrom would prevent the VM from
    starting as qemu doesn't accept the tuning for an empty drive. We now
    postpone setting the parameters until a new media is inserted.
  + Avoid taking extra host memory when launching pSeries guests

    Under certain conditions, pSeries guests were being launched with more
    RAM than it was specified in the domain XML by the user. New pSeries
    domains created with libvirt 7.0.0 will always launch with the right
    amount of initial memory. Existing guests that migrate from an older
    libvirt version to 7.0.0 will not be affected by this change.
  + qemu: Don't cache NUMA caps

    virsh capabilities contains <topology/> section which reports NUMA
    topology among with amount of free hugepages per each NUMA node. However,
    these amounts were not updated between calls.
  + networkGetDHCPLeases: Handle leases with infinite expiry time

    Since libvirt-6.3.0 it is possible to configure expiry time for DHCP
    leases. If the expiry time was infinite then virsh net-dhcp-leases
    and NSS plugins refused to work.
  + qemu: Don't prealloc mem for real NVDIMMs

    If a real life NVDIMM is assigned to a guest via <memory model='nvdimm'/>
    then QEMU is no longer instructed to preallocate memory
    for it. This prevents unnecessary wear on the NVDIMM.
  + network: Introduce mutex for bridge name generation

    When new libvirt network is defined or created and the input XML does not
    contain any bridge name, libvirt generates one. However, it might have
    happened that the same name would be generated for different networks if
    two or more networks were defined/created at once.

# v6.10.0 (2020-12-01)[¶](#v6-10-0-2020-12-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + qemu: Enable client TLS certificate validation by default for chardev,
    migration, and backup servers.

    The default value if qemu.conf options chardev\_tls\_x509\_verify,
    migrate\_tls\_x509\_verify, or backup\_tls\_x509\_verify are not
    specified explicitly in the config file and also the
    default\_tls\_x509\_verify config option is missing are now '1'. This
    ensures that only legitimate clients access servers, which don't have any
    additional form of authentication.
  + qemu: Introduce "migrate\_tls\_force" qemu.conf option

    The migrate\_tls\_force configuration option allows administrators to
    always force connections used for migration to be TLS secured as if the
    VIR\_MIGRATE\_TLS flag had been used.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Implement OpenSSH authorized key file management APIs

    New APIs (virDomainAuthorizedSSHKeysGet() and
    virDomainAuthorizedSSHKeysSet()) and virsh commands
    (get-user-sshkeys and set-user-sshkeys) are added to manage
    authorized\_keys SSH file for user.
  + hyperv: implement new APIs

    The virDomainGetMaxMemory(), virDomainSetMaxMemory(),
    virDomainGetSchedulerType(), virDomainGetSchedulerParameters(),
    virDomainGetSchedulerParametersFlags(), virDomainGetVcpus(),
    virDomainGetVcpusFlags(), virDomainGetMaxVcpus(),
    virDomainSetVcpus(), and virDomainSetVcpusFlags() APIs have been
    implemented in the Hyper-V driver.
  + qemu: Add 'fmode' and 'dmode' options for 9pfs

    Expose QEMU's 9pfs 'fmode' and 'dmode' options via attributes on the
    'filesystem' node in the domain XML. These options control the creation
    mode of files and directories, respectively, when using accessmode=mapped.
    It requires QEMU 2.10 or above.
  + qemu: support kvm-poll-control performance hint

    Implement the new KVM feature 'poll-control' to set this performance hint
    for KVM guests. It requires QEMU 4.2 or above.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Support network disks in virsh attach-disk

    The virsh attach-disk helper command which simplifies attaching of disks
    without the need for the user to formulate the disk XML manually now
    supports network-backed images. Users can specify the protocol and host
    specification with new command line arguments. Please refer to the man
    page of virsh for further information.
* **Bug fixes**

  + remote: fixed performance regression in SSH tunnelling

    The virt-ssh-helper binary introduced in 6.8.0 had very
    poor scalability which impacted libvirt tunnelled migration
    and storage volume upload/download in particular. It has been
    updated and now has performance on par with netcat.
* **Removed features**

  + hyperv: removed support for the Hyper-V V1 WMI API

    This drops support for Windows Server 2008R2 and 2012.
    The earliest supported version is now Windows 2012R2.

# v6.9.0 (2020-11-02)[¶](#v6-9-0-2020-11-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + nodedev: Add support for channel subsystem (CSS) devices on S390

    A CSS device is represented as a parent device of a CCW device.
    This support allows to create vfio-ccw mediated devices with
    virNodeDeviceCreateXML().
  + qemu: Implement memory failure event

    New event is implemented that is emitted whenever a guest encounters a
    memory failure.
  + qemu: Implement support for <transient/> disks

    VMs based on the QEMU hypervisor now can use <transient/> option for
    local file-backed disks to configure a disk which discards changes made to
    it while the VM was active.
  + hyperv: implement new APIs

    The virConnectGetCapabilities(), virConnectGetMaxVcpus(),
    virConnectGetVersion(), virDomainGetAutostart(),
    virDomainSetAutostart(), virNodeGetFreeMemory(),
    virDomainReboot(), virDomainReset(), virDomainShutdown(), and
    virDomainShutdownFlags() APIs have been implemented in the Hyper-V
    driver.
  + bhyve: implement virtio-9p filesystem support

    Implement virito-9p shared filesystem using the <filesystem/> element.
  + qemu: Add support for vDPA network devices.

    VMs using the QEMU hypervisor can now specify vDPA network devices
    using <interface type='vdpa'>. The node device APIs also now
    list and provide XML descriptions for vDPA devices.
  + cpu\_map: Add EPYC-Rome CPU model

    It's supported in QEMU 5.0.0 and newer.
  + cpu: Add a flag for XML validation in CPU comparison

    The virConnectCompareCPU and virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU API
    now support the VIR\_CONNECT\_COMPARE\_CPU\_VALIDATE\_XML flag, which
    enables XML validation. For virsh, this feature is enabled by passing
    the --validate option to the cpu-compare and
    hypervisor-cpu-compare subcommands.
  + qemu: Introduce virtio-balloon free page reporting feature

    Introduce the optional attribute free-page-reporting for virtio
    memballoon device. It enables/disables the ability of the QEMU virtio
    memory balloon to return unused pages back to the hypervisor. QEMU 5.1
    and newer support this feature.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Make 'cbitpos' & 'reducedPhysBits' attrs optional

    Libvirt probes the underlying platform in order to fill in these SEV
    attributes automatically before launching a guest.
  + util: support device stats collection for SR-IOV VF hostdev

    For SR-IOV VF hostdevs, libvirt now supports retrieving device traffic
    stats via the virDomainInterfaceStats API and virsh domifstat.
  + logging: Allow disabling log rollover

    Set max\_len=0 in virtlogd.conf to disable log rollover.
  + qemu: Set noqueue qdisc for TAP devices

    Set noqueue instead of the former pfifo\_fast queue discipline
    for TAP devices. It will avoid needless cost of host CPU cycles and
    thus improve performance.
  + qemu: virtiofs can be used without NUMA nodes

    Virtiofs is supported for the VM without NUMA nodes but configured with
    shared memory.
* **Bug fixes**

  + hyperv: ensure WQL queries work in all locales

    Relying on the "Description" field caused queries to fail on non-"en-US"
    systems. The queries have been updated to avoid using localized strings.
  + rpc: Fix virt-ssh-helper detection

    libvirt 6.8.0 failed to correctly detect the availability of the new
    virt-ssh-helper command on the remote host, and thus always used the
    fallback instead; this has now been fixed.

# v6.8.0 (2020-10-01)[¶](#v6-8-0-2020-10-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + qemu: double free in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu\_agent.c

    Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions
    may be able to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service,
    or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. CVE-2020-25637.
* **New features**

  + xen: Add writeFiltering attribute for PCI devices

    By default Xen filters guest writes to the PCI configuration space of a
    PCI hostdev, which may cause problems for some devices. The writeFiltering
    attribute of the device's <source> element can be used to disable the
    filtering and allow all guest writes to the configuration space.
  + bhyve: Support setting the framebuffer resolution

    Libvirt can now set the framebuffer's "w" and "h" parameters
    using the resolution element.
  + bhyve: Support VNC password authentication

    Libvirt can now probe whether the bhyve binary supports
    VNC password authentication. In case it does, a VNC password
    can now be passed using the passwd attribute on
    the <graphics> element.
  + remote: virt-ssh-helper replaces nc for SSH tunnelling

    Libvirt now provides a virt-ssh-helper binary on the server
    side. The libvirt remote client will use this binary for setting
    up an SSH tunnelled connection to hosts. If not present, it will
    transparently fallback to the traditional nc tunnel. The new
    binary makes it possible for libvirt to transparently connect
    across hosts even if libvirt is built with a different installation
    prefix on the client vs server. It also enables remote access to
    the unprivileged per-user libvirt daemons (e.g. using a URI such as
    qemu+ssh://hostname/session). The only requirement is that
    virt-ssh-helper is present in $PATH of the remote host.
  + esx: implement few APIs

    The virConnectListAllNetworks(), virDomainGetHostname(), and
    virDomainInterfaceAddresses() (only for
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_INTERFACE\_ADDRESSES\_SRC\_AGENT source) APIs were implemented
    in the esx driver.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Allow migration over UNIX sockets

    QEMU migration can now be performed completely over UNIX sockets. This is
    useful for containerised scenarios and can be used in both peer2peer and
    direct migrations.
  + dbus: Use GLib implementation instead of libdbus

    Adopting GLib DBus implementation simplifies our code as libdbus provides
    low-level APIs where we had to have a lot of helper functions. With this
    change we also remove dependency on libdbus and possibly fix all the DBus
    related libvirtd crashes seen over the time.
  + Re-introduce NVDIMM auto-alignment for pSeries Guests

    The auto-alignment logic was removed in v6.7.0 in favor of requiring the
    size provided by the user to be already aligned; however, this had the
    unintended consequence of breaking some existing guests. v6.8.0 restores
    the previous behavior with an improvement: it also reflects the auto-aligned
    value in the domain XML.
  + qemu: Preserve qcow2 cluster size after external snapshots

    The new overlay image which is installed on top of the current chain when
    taking an external snapshot now preserves the cluster size of the original
    top image to preserve any performance tuning done on the original image.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Various (i)SCSI backed hostdev fixes

    (i)SCSI backed hostdevs now work again with an arbitrarily long
    user-specified device alias and also honor the 'readonly' property after a
    recent rewrite.
* **Removed features**

  + node\_device: Remove HAL node device backend

    HAL is deprecated on all supported OS so there is no need to keep it
    in libvirt. udev backend is used on Linux OSes and devd can be eventually
    implemented as replacement for FreeBSD.

# v6.7.0 (2020-09-01)[¶](#v6-7-0-2020-09-01 "Link to this headline")

* **Packaging changes**

  + Libvirt switch to Meson build system

    Libvirt abandoned autotools and switched to Meson build system.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for initiator IQN configuration for iSCSI hostdevs

    Similarly to iSCSI <disk> users can use an <initiator> element
    inside <hostdev> with the same format to configure the IQN value
    used by the qemu initiator when connecting to an iSCSI target.
  + xen: Add support for device model command-line passthrough

    Xen supports passing arbitrary arguments to the QEMU device model using
    the device\_model\_args setting in xl.cfg(5). The libvirt xen driver now
    supports this using <xen:commandline/> XML extensions.
  + shmem: Add support for shmem-{plain, doorbell} role option

    The role attribute controls how the domain behaves on migration. With
    role=master, the guest will copy the shared memory on migration to
    the destination host. With role=peer, the migration is disabled.
  + bhyve: Sound device support

    This feature allows to configure guest sound device using
    the <sound> element, and map it to the host sound device using
    the <audio> element.
* **Improvements**

  + Allow sparse streams for block devices

    Sparse streams (e.g. virsh vol-download --sparse or virsh vol-upload --sparse) now handle if one of the stream ends is a block device.
  + Remove NVDIMM auto-alignment for pSeries Guests

    This feature was introduced in libvirt v6.2.0 as part of the overall
    NVDIMM support for pSeries guests. The idea was to relieve the user
    from knowing ppc64 alignment details, but the end result is that we
    ended up with inconsistencies between domain XML and actual NVDIMM
    size the guest is using. To promote consistency between domain XML
    and the guest, unaligned NVDIMM sizes for pSeries guests will now be
    forbidden and no size auto-alignment will be made. Instead, libvirt will
    suggest an aligned round up size for the user.
  + apparmor: Several improvements

    Add support for virtiofs filesystem and allow QEMU to load old
    shared objects after upgrade.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virdevmapper: Deal with kernels without DM support

    In the previous release libvirt dropped libdevmapper in favor of its own
    implementation. However, it failed to deal correctly with kernels that
    either don't have device mapper enabled or where the dm-mod module is not
    loaded yet. This is now fixed.
  + resctrl: Use exclusive lock for /sys/fs/resctrl

    When two or more domains were attempted to start at once, due to a bug in
    implementation, resctrl was not locked properly and thus threads did not
    mutually exclude with each other resulting in not setting requested
    limitations.
  + mdev: Fix daemon crash when reattaching mdevs on assignment conflict

    If there's a list of mdevs to be assigned to a domain, but one of them (NOT
    the first) is already assigned to a different domain then libvirtd would
    crash. This is now fixed.
  + Fix logic in setting COW flag on btrfs

    When COW is not explicitly requested to be disabled or enabled, then
    libvirt should do nothing on non-BTRFS file systems.
  + Avoid crash due to race in glib event loop code

    Libvirt switched to glib event loop in 6.1.0 but it was also tickling a bug
    in glib code leading to the daemon crash. Libvirt way of calling glib was
    changed so the daemon crashes no more.
  + virdevmapper: Handle kernel without device-mapper support

    In the previous release, Libvirt dropped libdevmapper in favor of its own
    implementation. But the implementation did not handle kernels without
    device-mapper support. This is now fixed.
  + remove autogenerated macvtap names from migration XML

    Autogenerated macvtap device names were being left in the
    migration XML, which could result in libvirt erroneously deleting
    the macvtap device of a different guest in the aftermath of
    failing to restart the guest on the destination host. Removing the
    autogenerated names avoids this.

# v6.6.0 (2020-08-02)[¶](#v6-6-0-2020-08-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Allow configuring of ACPI NUMA HMAT

    Libvirt allows configuring ACPI Heterogeneous Memory Attribute Table to
    hint software running inside the guest on optimization.
  + esx: Add a type attribute for mac addresses.

    This attribute allows (when set to static) ignoring VMWare checks of the
    MAC addresses that would generate a new one if they were in its OUI
    (00:0c:29).
  + conf: add control over COW for storage pool directories

    The storage pool code now attempts to disable COW by default on btrfs, but
    management applications may wish to override this behaviour. This is now
    possible via new cow element.
* **Improvements**

  + esx: Change the NIC limit for recent virtualHW versions

    Specifying a virtualHW version greater or equal to 7 (ESXi 4.0) will allow
    you to use up to 10 NICs instead of 4 as it was previously.
  + qemu: Support encrypted TLS keys for NBD disks

    The secret key used for disks can now be encrypted similarly to TLS keys
    used for migration, chardev and others.
  + qemu: VIR\_DOMAIN\_EVENT\_ID\_BLOCK\_THRESHOLD can now be registered for <mirror>

    The event can now be used also for block copy destinations by using the
    index of the <mirror> image.
  + qemu: consider available CPUs in vcpupin/emulatorpin output

    This patch changes the default bitmap of vcpupin and emulatorpin,
    in the case of domains with static vcpu placement, all available CPUs
    instead of all possible CPUs are returned making these APIs consistent with
    the behavior of vcpuinfo.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virdevmapper: Don't use libdevmapper to obtain dependencies

    When building domain's private /dev in a namespace, libdevmapper was
    consulted for getting full dependency tree of domain's disks. However, this
    meant that libdevmapper opened /dev/mapper/control which wasn't closed
    and was leaked to QEMU. CVE-2020-14339
  + qemu: Report correct index in VIR\_DOMAIN\_EVENT\_ID\_BLOCK\_THRESHOLD

    Starting from libvirt 5.10 with QEMU 4.2 the
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_EVENT\_ID\_BLOCK\_THRESHOLD event would report incorrect device
    index when reported for an image from the backing chain of a disk.
  + qemu: Don't fail active layer block commit or block copy in certain cases

    Starting from libvirt-6.5 an active layer block commit or a block copy could
    fail if the same destination was used more than once.
  + qemu: Don't change ownership of restore file

    When restoring a domain from a file, Libvirt no longer changes its ownership.
  + qemu: Set SPAPR TPM default to 2.0 and prevent 1.2 choice

    The firmware (SLOF) on QEMU for ppc64 does not support TPM 1.2, so prevent
    the choice of TPM 1.2 when the SPAPR device model is chosen and use a
    default of '2.0' (TPM 2) for the backend.
  + qemu: Do not set //cpu/@migratable for running domains

    Libvirt release of 6.4.0 started to fill the default value for
    //cpu/@migratable attribute according to QEMU support. However, active
    domains either have the migratable attribute already set or they were
    started with older Libvirt which doesn't support the attribute.

# v6.5.0 (2020-07-03)[¶](#v6-5-0-2020-07-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Allow firmware blobs configuration

    QEMU offers a way to tweak how firmware configures itself
    and/or provide new configuration blobs. New <sysinfo/>
    type is introduced that will hold these new blobs.
    It's possible to either specify new value as a string or
    provide a filename which contents then serve as the value.
  + nodedev: Add ability to create mediated devices

    Mediated devices can now be created with virNodeDeviceCreateXML(). This
    functionality requires the mdevctl utility to be installed. The XML
    schema for node devices was expanded to support attributes for mediated
    devices.
  + QEMU: add TPM Proxy device support

    libvirt can now create guests using a new device type called
    "TPM Proxy". The TPM Proxy connects to a TPM Resource Manager
    present in the host, enabling the guest to run in secure virtual
    machine mode with the help of an Ultravisor. Adding a TPM Proxy to
    a pSeries guest brings no security benefits unless the guest is
    running on a PPC64 host that has Ultravisor and TPM Resource Manager
    support. Only one TPM Proxy is allowed per guest. A guest using
    a TPM Proxy device can instantiate another TPM device at the same
    time. This device is supported only for pSeries guests via the new
    'spapr-tpm-proxy' model of the TPM 'passthrough' backend.
  + virhook: Support hooks placed in several files

    Running all scripts from directory /etc/libvirt/hooks/<driver>.d in
    alphabetical order. Hook script in old place will be executed
    as first for backward compatibility.
  + qemu: Add support for migratable host-passthrough CPU

    QEMU 2.12 made it possible for guests to use a migration-friendly
    version of the host-passthrough CPU. This feature is now exposed by
    libvirt.
* **Improvements**

  + network: Support NAT with IPv6

    It's now possible to use <nat ipv6="yes"/> in a libvirt network.
  + qemu: Auto-fill NUMA information for incomplete topologies

    If the NUMA topology is not fully described in the guest XML, libvirt
    will complete it by putting all unspecified CPUs in the first NUMA node.
    This is only done in the QEMU binary itself supports disjointed CPU
    ranges for NUMA nodes.
  + qemu: Assign hostdev-backed interfaces to PCIe slots

    All SR-IOV capable devices are PCIe, so when their VFs are assigned to
    guests they should end up in PCIe slots rather than conventional PCI ones.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: fixed crash in qemuDomainBlockCommit

    This release fixes a regression which was introduced in libvirt v6.4.0
    where libvirtd always crashes when a block commit of a disk is requested.
  + qemu: fixed zPCI address auto generation on s390

    Removes the correlation between the zPCI address attributes uid and fid.
    Fixes the validation and autogeneration of zPCI address attributes.
  + qemu: Skip pre-creation of NVMe disks during migration

    libvirt has no way to create NVMe devices on the target host, so it now
    just makes sure they exist and let the migration proceed in that case.

# v6.4.0 (2020-06-02)[¶](#v6-4-0-2020-06-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for pvscsi controllers

    pvscsi is the VMware paravirtualized SCSI controller, which has been
    supported in QEMU for a number of years.
  + cpu: Report model information for ARM CPUs

    virsh capabilities will now include information about the host CPU when
    run on ARM machines.
  + qemu: support network interface downscript

    QEMU has the ability to run a script when a NIC is brought up and down.
    Libvirt only enables use of the up script. Now add support for postscript
    when NIC is down/detached.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: stricter validation for disk type='lun'

    The 'lun' type is meant for SCSI command passthrough, which can't be
    achieved if qemu's block layer features are used. Disk type='lun' is now
    allowed only when the format is 'raw' and no other block layer features are
    requested.
  + qemu: auto-fill of incomplete NUMA topologies

    Domains with incomplete NUMA topologies, where the sum of vCPUs in all NUMA
    cells is less than the total of vCPUs, will get their first NUMA cell to
    be auto-filled with the remaining vCPUs. This behavior reproduces what QEMU
    already does in these cases. Users are encouraged to provide complete NUMA
    topologies to avoid unexpected changes in the domain XML.
  + Cooperlake x86 CPU model is added
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: fixed regression in network device hotplug with new qemu versions

    Starting from QEMU-5.0 it's required to conform to strict schema when
    hotplugging network devices. Libvirt didn't conform to the schema so in
    versions prior to 6.4.0 network device hotplug fails in certain cases. This
    version fixes it and adds stricter testing to prevent further issues.
  + remote: Look up libxl driver correctly

    This makes xen:// connection URIs usable in split daemon mode.
  + systemd: Start libvirtd after firewalld/iptables services

    This solves an issue where iptables rules and chains created by libvirtd
    would get removed by a service started after it.
  + network: Re-create iptables chains on firewalld restart

    firewalld resets all iptables rules and chains on restart, and this
    includes deleting those created by libvirt.
  + qemu: reject readonly attribute for virtiofs

    virtiofs does not yet support read-only shares.

# v6.3.0 (2020-05-05)[¶](#v6-3-0-2020-05-05 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: support disabling hotplug/unplug of PCIe devices

    libvirt can now set the "hotplug" option for pcie-root-ports and
    pcie-switch-downstream-ports, which can be used to disable hotplug/unplug
    of devices from these ports (default behavior is for these controllers to
    accept all hotplug/unplug attempts, but this is often undesirable).
  + vbox: added support for version 6.0 and 6.1 APIs

    libvirt can now support use of the VirtualBox 6.0 and 6.1 APIs. This is
    compile tested only, so we are looking for feedback from users on how well
    it works in practice.
  + xen: Add support for 'e820\_host' hypervisor feature

    e820\_host is a Xen-specific option only available for PV guests. When
    enabled it provides the guest with a virtual e820 memory map based on the
    host one. It must be enabled to allow hotplugging PCI devices to PV guests,
    particularly when memory ballooning is enabled.
  + xen: Add support for 'passthrough' hypervisor feature

    passthrough is a Xen-specific option new to Xen 4.13 that enables PCI
    passthrough for guests. It must be enabled to allow hotplugging PCI
    devices.
  + qemu: support async IO mode 'io\_uring'

    Linux 5.1 introduces a fast and efficient async IO interface io\_uring, then
    qemu implements that in version 5.0. It could be used in file, host device
    and host cdrom backend by io='io\_uring' of disk XML.
  + Lease time option included for network DHCP settings

    Users can now configure expiry time for leases for networks where libvirt
    manages DHCP. The time can be specified for whole range and/or fine tuned
    per individual host.
  + qemu: Implement pSeries Spectre mitigation features

    Users can now setup the following capabilities of pSeries guests: CFPC
    (Cache Flush on Privilege Change), SBBC (Speculation Barrier Bounds
    Checking) and IBS (Indirect Branch Speculation).
  + qemu: Add support for virtio packed option

    The packed attribute controls if QEMU should try to use packed
    virtqueues. Possible values are on or off.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Allow checkpoint redefine for offline VMs

    Skip the liveness and capability checks when redefining checkpoints as we
    don't need QEMU interactions to update the metadata.
  + daemons: Improve timeout handling

    Daemons now support --timeout 0 which suppresses daemon killing after
    given time of inactivity.
  + qemu: Add support for 'multidevs' option

    This option prevents misbehaviours on guest if a QEMU 9pfs export contains
    multiple devices, due to the potential file ID collisions this otherwise
    may cause.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Various embed driver fixes

    When using shared resources from embed driver (e.g. hugepages, machined,
    etc.) libvirt now generates an unique handler that is not conflicting with
    other embed drivers or system or session daemons.
  + cpu: Distinguish Cascadelake-Server from Skylake-Server

    Libvirt now properly detects Cascadelake-Server and Skylake-Server
    processors which differ only in stepping.
  + qemu: Fix domain restore from a block device

    When using namespaces, libvirt was unable to restore a domain from a block
    device because libvirt tried to relabel the device inside the namespace
    while QEMU was given FD to the block device in the host.
  + node\_device\_udev: Handle move events

    Libvirt now handles move event which is emitted on a NIC rename.
  + qemu: Fix capabilities probing with TCG

    Libvirt no long assumes TCG is always available. It now detects whether
    QEMU supports TCG and reports it accordingly.
* **Removed features**

  + vbox: removed support for version 5.0 and 5.1 APIs

    libvirt no longer supports use of VirtualBox 5.0 and 5.1 since these
    versions reached their end of life on 2017/05 and 2018/04 respectively.

# v6.2.0 (2020-04-02)[¶](#v6-2-0-2020-04-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: NVDIMM support for pSeries guests

    QEMU 5.0 implements NVDIMM memory support for pSeries guests. This is done
    by adding an 'uuid' element in the memory XML, which can either be provided
    in the XML or, if omitted, generated automatically.
  + qemu: Add virtiofs support

    This feature, introduced in QEMU 4.2, is a more modern alternative to
    virtio-9p, which is exposed through the same <filesystem/> element.
  + admin: Support reloading TLS certificates

    After renewing TLS certificates, it was usually necessary to restart
    libvirtd for the new ones to be loaded: now the same result can be obtained
    without restarting the daemon by using virt-admin server-update-tls .
* **Removed features**

  + Removed support for INI style of comments

    With switching of our internal code to GLib, parsing of client
    authentication config files is handed over to GLib which does not support
    INI style of comments starting with a semicolon ( ; ). Use number
    sign ( # ) instead.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Don't compare local and remote hostnames on migration

    This check was introduced to prevent same-host migration, but did not work
    as expected when multiple libvirtd instances were running on the same host
    but in different containers. With this release, the host UUID (which should
    be unique to the container) is checked instead.
  + qemu: Use per-VM event loops

    Instead of using a single even loop to process communication with the QEMU
    monitor and guest agent, create a separate one for each VM. This helps with
    scalability and prevents scenarios where a single malfunctioning VM could
    affect all those running on the same host.
  + qemu: Support migration with SLIRP helper interface

    With QEMU 5.0, a new D-Bus backend allows migration of external processes.
    When needed, libvirt will start a per-vm D-Bus bus, and migrate the
    slirp-helper along with QEMU.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Open backing chain late for shallow block copy reusing external
    images

    With introduction of -blockdev for QEMU storage configuration in
    libvirt-5.10 we've started opening the backing chain of the
    destination/mirror of a virDomainBlockcopy started with
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_COPY\_REUSE\_EXT | VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_COPY\_SHALLOW flags when
    starting the job rather than when virDomainBlockJobAbort with
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_JOB\_ABORT\_PIVOT is issued. For users depending on this
    undocumented quirky pre-blockdev behaviour this caused a regression as the
    backing chain could not be modified while the copy of the top image was
    progressing due to QEMU image locking. Note that this fix also requires
    qemu-5.0 while -blockdev is used starting from QEMU-4.2.
  + Don't generate machine names containing dots

    Even though the guest name containing dots is not a problem for libvirt
    itself, we need to strip them out when registering with machined because of
    the latter's requirements.

# v6.1.0 (2020-03-03)[¶](#v6-1-0-2020-03-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: new rng backend type: builtin

    It implements qemu builtin rng backend. That uses getrandom syscall to
    generate random, no external rng source needed. Available since QEMU 4.2.
  + support for virtio+hostdev NIC <teaming>

    QEMU 4.2.0 and later, combined with a sufficiently recent guest virtio-net
    driver (e.g. the driver included in Linux kernel 4.18 and later), supports
    setting up a simple network bond device comprised of one virtio emulated
    NIC and one hostdev NIC (which must be an SRIOV VF). (in QEMU, this is
    known as the "virtio failover" feature). The allure of this setup is that
    the bond will always favor the hostdev device, providing better
    performance, until the guest is migrated - at that time QEMU will
    automatically unplug the hostdev NIC and the bond will send all traffic via
    the virtio NIC until migration is completed, then QEMU on the destination
    side will hotplug a new hostdev NIC and the bond will switch back to using
    the hostdev for network traffic. The result is that guests desiring the
    extra performance of a hostdev NIC are now migratable without network
    downtime (performance is just degraded during migration) and without
    requiring a complicated bonding configuration in the guest OS network
    config and complicated unplug/replug logic in the management application on
    the host - it can instead all be accomplished in libvirt with the interface
    <teaming> subelement "type" and "persistent" attributes.
  + support BR\_ISOLATED flag for guest interfaces attached to a Linux host
    bridge

    Since Linux kernel 4.18, the Linux host bridge has had a flag BR\_ISOLATED
    that can be applied to individual ports. When this flag is set for a port,
    traffic is blocked between that port and any other port that also has the
    BR\_ISOLATED flag set. libvirt domain interface config now supports setting
    this flag via the <port isolated='yes'/> setting. It can also be set for
    all connections to a particular libvirt network by setting the same option
    in the network config - since the port for the host itself does not have
    BR\_ISOLATED set, the guests can communicate with the host and the outside
    world, but guests on that network can't communicate with each other. This
    feature works for QEMU and LXC guests with interfaces attached to a Linux
    host bridge.
  + qemu: Introduce the 'armvtimer' timer type

    QEMU 5.0 introduces the ability to control the behavior of the virtual
    timer for KVM ARM/virt guests, and this new timer type exposes the same
    capability to libvirt users.
  + qemu: Storage configuration improvements

    Libvirt now accepts <backingStore type='volume'> and allows specifying
    the offset and size of the image format container inside the storage source
    via the <slices> subelement.
  + qemu: Introduce the 'tpm-spapr' TPM model

    This device, available starting from QEMU 5.0, is limited to pSeries
    guests.
  + qemu: support Panic Crashloaded event handling

    The pvpanic device now supports a 'crashloaded' event, which is emitted
    when a guest panic has occurred but has already been handled by the guest
    itself.
  + qemu: Implement virDomainGetHostnameFlags

    The --source argument to virsh domhostname can be used to specify
    what data source to use for the domain hostnames. Currently, in addition
    to the 'agent', libvirt can also use 'lease' information from dnsmasq to
    get the hostname.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Image format probing is allowed in certain cases

    To resolve regressions when users didn't specify the backing image format
    in the overlay, libvirt now probes the format in certain secure scenarios
    which fixes a few common existing cases. Additionally the knowledge base
    was extended to provide more information on how to rectify the problem.
  + qemu: Support "dies" in CPU topology

    This CPU topology concept, new in QEMU 4.1.0, sits between the existing
    "socket" and "core".
  + libxl: Add support for Credit2 scheduler parameters
  + lxc: Add support LXC 3 network configuration format
* **Bug fixes**

  + conf: Do not generate machine names ending with a dash

    Recent systemd versions do not allow them.
* **Packaging changes**

  + use of gnulib has been completely eliminated

    Historically libvirt has embedded gnulib to provide fixes for various
    platform portability problems. This usage has now been eliminated and
    alternative approaches for platform portability problems adopted where
    required. This has been validated on the set of platforms covered by
    automated CI build testing. Other modern Linux distros using glibc are
    expected to work. Linux distros using non-glibc packages, and other
    non-Linux platforms may encounter regressions when building this release.
    Please report any build problems encountered back to the project
    maintainers for evaluation.

# v6.0.0 (2020-01-15)[¶](#v6-0-0-2020-01-15 "Link to this headline")

* **Packaging changes**

  + support for python2 is removed

    Libvirt is no longer able to be built using the Python 2 binary. Python 3
    must be used instead.
  + docs: the python docutils toolset is now required

    The use of rst2html has been introduced for the website build process since
    docs are now being written in the RST as an alternative to HTML.
* **New features**

  + new PCI hostdev address type: unassigned

    A new PCI hostdev address type 'unassigned' is introduced. An unassigned
    PCI hostdev behaves like any regular PCI hostdev inside Libvirt, but it is
    not usable by the guest. This gives the user a new option to manage the
    binding of PCI devices via Libvirt, declaring PCI hostdevs in the domain
    XML but allowing just a subset of them to be assigned to the guest.
  + Provide init scripts for sub-deaemons

    So far libvirt shipped systemd unit files for sub-daemons. With this
    release, init scripts are available too. Package maintainers can choose
    which one to install via --with-init-script configure option.
  + qemu: Support cold-unplug of sound devices
  + qemu: Implement VIR\_MIGRATE\_PARAM\_TLS\_DESTINATION

    This flag, which can be enabled using virsh 's --tls-destination
    option, allows migration to succeed in situations where there is a mismatch
    between the destination's hostname and the information stored in its TLS
    certificate.
  + qemu: Support reporting memory bandwidth usage stats

    Implement Intel RDT-MBM in libvirt. The stats can be obtained via virsh domstats --memory .
  + qemu: Allow accessing NVMe disks directly

    Before this release there were two ways to configure a NVMe disk for a
    domain. The first was using <disk/> with the <source/> pointing to the
    /dev/nvmeXXXX . The other was using PCI assignment via <hostdev/>
    element. Both have their disadvantages: the former adds latency of file
    system and block layers of the host kernel, the latter prohibits domain
    migration. In this release the third way of configuring NVMe disk is added
    which combines the advantages and drops disadvantages of the previous two
    ways. It's accessible via <disk type='nvme'/>.
* **Removed features**

  + 'phyp' Power Hypervisor driver removed

    The 'phyp' Power Hypervisor driver has not seen active development since
    2011 and does not seem to have any real world usage. It has now been
    removed.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: xz save image compression is faster

    When using the xz format to compressed virtual machine saved state images,
    the "-3" compression level preset is now used. This results in slightly
    larger files, but with a massively reduced time to compress. The xz format
    offers the best compression level for saved state images, albeit still with
    the slowest running time. For the fastest possible running time, at cost of
    the larest compressed size, lzop should be used.
  + domain: Improve job stat handling

    It is now possible to retrieve stats for completed and failed jobs.
  + qemu: Don't hold monitor and agent job at the same time

    Before this change, a malicious (or buggy) qemu-guest-agent running in
    the guest could make other libvirt APIs unavailable for an unbounded amount
    of time.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Report error if backing image format is not specified explicitly

    For a long time libvirt was assuming that a backing file is RAW when the
    format was not specified. This didn't pose a problem until blockdev support
    was enabled in last release. Libvirt now requires that the format is
    specified in the image metadata or domain XML and the VM will refuse to
    start otherwise. Additionally the error message now links to the knowledge
    base which summarizes how to fix the images.
  + qemu: Fix non-shared storage migration over NBD
  + qemu: Generate a single MAC address for hotplugged network devices

    Since libvirt 4.6.0, when hotplugging a network device that didn't have a
    MAC address already assigned by the user, two separate addresses would be
    generated: one for the live configuration, which would show up immediately,
    and one for the inactive configuration, which would show up after the first
    reboot. This situation was clearly undesirable, so a single MAC address is
    now generated and used both for the live configuration and the inactive
    one.

# v5.10.0 (2019-12-02)[¶](#v5-10-0-2019-12-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce support for ARM CPU features

    The only features supported at the moment are SVE vector lengths, which
    were introduced in QEMU 4.2.0.
  + qemu: Support boot display for GPU mediated devices

    Until now, GPU mediated devices generally did not show any output until the
    guest OS had initialized the vGPU. By specifying the ramfb attribute,
    QEMU can be configured to use ramfb as a boot display for the device: this
    allows for display of firmware messages, boot loader menu, and other output
    before the guest OS has initialized the vGPU.
  + Add API to change the response timeout for guest agent commands

    By default, when a command is sent to the guest agent, libvirt waits
    forever for a response from the guest agent. If the guest is unresponsive
    for any reason, this can block the calling thread indefinitely. By setting
    a custom timeout using virDomainAgentSetResponseTimeout() , API users
    can change this behavior.
* **Improvements**

  + Devices CGroup v2 support

    Libvirt supported all controllers of CGroup v2 but the devices controller
    which is implemented in this release.
  + Cold plug of sound device

    The QEMU driver now can handle cold plug of <sound/> devices.
  + Probe for default CPU types

    With QEMU 4.2.0 we can probe for the default CPU model used by QEMU for a
    particular machine type and store it in the domain XML. This way the chosen
    CPU model is more visible to users and libvirt will make sure the guest
    will see the exact same CPU after migration.
  + Adaptation to qemu's blockdev

    QEMU introduced a new way of specifying disks on the command line which
    enables fine-grained control over the block stack. Libvirt has adapted to
    this.
* **Refactors**

  + More GLib integration

    More patches were merged that replace our internal functions with GLib
    ones. Also some effort was invested in replacing gnulib modules with GLib
    functions.
  + Rewrite of Perl scripts into Python

    Libvirt used Perl scripts to check for coding style, generate some code and
    things like that. To bring the number of languages used down, these scripts
    were rewritten into Python.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Warn verbosely if using old loader:nvram pairs

    Some distributions still use --with-loader-nvram or nvram variable
    in qemu.conf. This is now discouraged in favour of FW descriptors. However,
    instead of silently ignoring user's config, libvirt warns if outdated
    config is detected.
  + Drop pconfig from Icelake-Server CPU model

    The pconfig feature was enabled in QEMU by accident in 3.1.0. All other
    newer versions do not support it and it was removed from the Icelake-Server
    CPU model in QEMU.
  + Wait longer for device removal confirmation on PPC64

    After sending device hot unplug request to QEMU, libvirt waits up to 5
    seconds for qemu to confirm the device removal. On some architectures (like
    PPC64) this can take longer time and libvirt now reflects that.
  + Forcibly create nodes in domain's namespace

    The QEMU driver starts a domain in a namespace with private /dev and
    creates only those nodes there which the domain is configured to have.
    However, it may have happened that if a node changed its minor number this
    change wasn't propagated to the namespace.
  + Various AppArmor bugfixes

    The AppArmor driver now knows how to handle <shmem/> devices and also
    snapshotting more disks at once.
  + Improved video model autoselection

    If a graphics device was added to XML that had no video device, libvirt
    automatically added a video device which was always of type 'cirrus' on
    x86\_64, even if the underlying qemu didn't support cirrus. Libvirt now
    bases the decision on qemu's capabilities.

# v5.9.0 (2019-11-05)[¶](#v5-9-0-2019-11-05 "Link to this headline")

* **Packaging changes**

  + Start linking against GLib and using its features

    Up until now, libvirt has been dealing with platform portability and the
    lack of certain features in libc by using gnulib and implementing its own
    functions and data structures respectively; going forward, it will prefer
    the facilities offered by GLib instead.
  + Stop distributing generated documentation

    Most downstreams already patch the libvirt source to some extent, so this
    change will probably not affect them.
  + Rewrite several Perl scripts in Python

    Phasing out Perl usage is part of the project strategy.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce a new video model of type 'ramfb'

    Introduce a new video model type to the domain XML that supports the
    ramfb standalone device in qemu.
  + qemu: Implement the ccf-assist pSeries feature

    Users can now decide whether ccf-assist (Count Cache Flush Assist) support
    should be available to pSeries guests.
  + Xen: Support specifying ACPI firmware path

    The libxl driver now supports specifying an ACPI firmware path using the
    acpi element.
  + qemu: Support specifying resolution for video devices
* **Removed features**

  + logging: Drop support for including stack traces

    This feature was intended to aid debugging, but in practice it resulted in
    logs that were too verbose to be useful and also resulted in a significant
    performance penalty.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Implement CPU comparison/baseline on s390x

    This functionality has been historically limited to x86\_64, but it's now
    available on s390x too.
* **Bug fixes**

  + lib: autostart objects exactly once

    If libvirtd or any of the sub-daemons is started with socket activation
    then objects might be autostarted more than once. For instance, if a domain
    under qemu:///session URI is mark as autostarted and the session daemon
    is started then the domain is started with it. If user shuts the domain
    down and the session daemon is started again, the user's wish to keep the
    domain shut off is ignored and the domain is autostarted again. This is now
    fixed.
  + qemu: Properly advertise bochs-display availability

    Support for bochs-display was introduced in libvirt 5.6.0, but until
    now the model was not listed in the domain capabilities.
  + security: Don't remember labels for TPM devices

    Due to the way they're implemented in the kernel, trying to remember labels
    for TPM devices makes it impossible to use them.
  + security: Properly rollback after failure in a stacked driver

    When multiple security drivers are involved, failure in one of them would
    result in only the corresponding changes being rolled back, leaving the
    ones performed by drivers that had been activated earlier in place. All
    changes are rolled back now.
  + Fix build with musl libc
  + Improve compatibility with non-bash shells

# v5.8.0 (2019-10-05)[¶](#v5-8-0-2019-10-05 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Support use of precreated tap/macvtap devices by unprivileged
    libvirtd

    It is now possible for an unprivileged libvirtd to make use of tap and
    macvtap devices that were previously created by some other entity. This is
    done by setting managed='no' along with the device name in the
    target subelement of <interface type='ethernet'> .
  + qemu: Support vhost-user-gpu

    Support for running virtio GPUs in separate processes with vhost-user
    backend. It requires QEMU newer than 4.1.
  + Introduce virConnectSetIdentity API

    When split daemons are in use, this API is used to forward uid, gid and
    SELinux info from virproxyd to other driver daemons such as
    virtqemud .
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Support running SLIRP networking in a separate process

    User can configure the slirp-helper path in qemu.conf . It will start a
    slirp-helper process to provide SLIRP networking when the VM is started
    with network interface "user". That will allow stricter security policies
    for QEMU SLIRP network.
* **Removed features**

  + Remove xenapi driver

    The xenapi driver is removed since it has not received any significant
    development since its initial contribution nine years ago and has no known
    user base.

# v5.7.0 (2019-09-03)[¶](#v5-7-0-2019-09-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Support Direct Mode for Hyper-V Synthetic timers

    The QEMU driver now supports Direct Mode for Hyper-V Synthetic timers for
    Hyper-V guests.
  + lib: Add virDomainGetGuestInfo()

    This API is intended to aggregate several guest agent information queries
    and is inspired by stats API virDomainListGetStats() . It is
    anticipated that this information will be provided by a guest agent running
    within the domain. It's exposed as virsh guestinfo .
  + Experimental split of libvirtd into separate daemons

    The big monolithic libvirtd daemon can now be replaced by smaller
    per-driver daemons. The new split daemons are considered experimental at
    this time and distributions are encouraged to continue using the
    traditional libvirtd by default.
  + qemu: Support kvm-hint-dedicated performance hint

    With <hint-dedicated state='on'/> and <cpu mode='host-passthrough'/> , it allows a guest to enable optimizations
    when running on dedicated vCPUs. QEMU newer than 2.12.0 and kernel newer
    than 4.17 are required.
* **Removed features**

  + Remove KVM assignment support

    The KVM style of PCI device assignment was removed from the kernel in
    version 4.12.0 after being deprecated since 4.2.0. Libvirt defaults to VFIO
    for a long time. Remove support for KVM device assignment from libvirt too.
  + libxml: min required libxml is now 2.9.1

    Support for building with libxml versions older than 2.9.1 has been
    dropped.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Support setting bandwidth in migrate subcommand

    In addition to postcopy bandwidth, the virsh migrate subcommand now
    supports specifying precopy bandwidth with the --bandwidth parameter.
  + libxl: Implement domain metadata getter/setter

    The libxl driver now supports virDomainGetMetadata() and
    virDomainSetMetadata() APIs.
  + test driver: Expand API coverage

    Additional APIs have been implemented in the test driver.
  + Report RNG device in domain capabilities XML

    Libvirt now reports if RNG devices are supported by the underlying
    hypervisor in the domain capabilities XML.
  + Stop linking NSS plugins with libvirt.so

    This reduces the amount of code and 3rd party libraries are that loaded
    into all processes.
  + Split the setuid virt-login-shell binary into two pieces

    The setuid virt-login-shell binary is now a tiny shim that sanitizes the
    process execution environment variables and arguments, before launching the
    trusted virt-login-shell-helper binary.
  + qemu: Allow migration with disk cache on

    When QEMU supports flushing caches at the end of migration, we can safely
    allow migration even if disk/driver/@cache is neither none nor
    directsync .
* **Bug fixes**

  + Various security label remembering fixes

    In the previous release libvirt introduced remembering of original owners
    and SELinux labels on files. However, the feature did not work properly
    with snapshots, on migrations or on network filesystems. This is now fixed.
  + Allow greater PCI domain numbers

    Libvirt used to require PCI domain number to be not greater than 0xFFFF.
    The code was changed to allow 32 bits long numbers.
  + Various D-Bus fixes

    When D-Bus is not available, libvirt was reporting random errors. These are
    now gone.
  + Prefer read-only opening of PCI config files

    When enumerating PCI bus, libvirt opens config files under sysfs mount
    and parses them to learn various aspects of the device (e.g. its
    capabilities). Only in a very limited number of cases it is actually
    writing into the file. However, it used to open the file also for writing
    even if it was only reading from it.
  + Fix AppArmor profile

    Since the 5.6.0 release, libvirt uses procfs to learn the list of
    opened file descriptors when spawning a command. However, our AppArmor
    profile was not allowing such access.
  + Don't block storage driver when starting or building a pool

    Starting or building a storage pool can take a long time to finish. During
    this time the storage driver was blocked and thus no other API involving
    the storage driver could run. This is now fixed.

# v5.6.0 (2019-08-05)[¶](#v5-6-0-2019-08-05 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Introduce a new video model of type 'bochs'

    Introduce a new video model type that supports the bochs-display device
    that was added in qemu version 3.0.
  + api: new virDomainCheckpoint APIs

    Introduce several new APIs for creating and managing checkpoints in the
    test and qemu drivers (the latter requires qcow2 images). Checkpoints serve
    as a way to tell which portions of a disk have changed since a point in
    time.
  + qemu: Add support for overriding max threads per process limit

    systemd-based systems impose a limit on the number of threads a process can
    spawn, which in some cases can be exceeded by QEMU processes running VMs.
    Add a max\_threads\_per\_process option to qemu.conf to override the
    system default.
  + Remember original owners and SELinux labels of files

    When a domain is starting up libvirt changes DAC and SELinux labels so that
    domain can access it. However, it never remembered the original labels and
    therefore the file was returned back to root:root . With this release,
    the original labels are remembered and restored properly.
  + network: Allow passing arbitrary options to dnsmasq

    This works similarly to the existing support for passing arbitrary options
    to QEMU, and just like that feature it comes with no support guarantees.
* **Removed features**

  + xen: Remove sxpr config support

    Remove the sxpr style config parser and formatter a year after the xend
    driver was removed.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Allow XML validation for snapshot creation

    Add flag VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_CREATE\_VALIDATE to validate snapshot input
    XML. For virsh, users can use it as virsh snapshot-create --validate .
  + Support encrypted soft TPM

    A soft TPM backend could be encrypted with passphrase. Now libvirt supports
    using a secret object to hold the passphrase, and referring to it via
    the encryption element of the TPM device.
  + test driver: Expand API coverage

    Additional APIs have been implemented in the test driver.
  + Implement per-driver locking

    Drivers now acquire a lock when they're loaded, ensuring that there can
    never be two instances of the same driver active at a time.
  + nss: Report newer addresses first

    In some cases, a guest might be assigned a new IP address by DHCP before
    the previous lease has expired, in which case the NSS plugin will correctly
    report both addresses; many applications, however, ignore all addresses but
    the first, and may thus end up trying to connect using a stale address. To
    prevent that from happening, the NSS plugin will now always report the
    newest address first.
  + util: Optimize mass closing of FDs when spawning child processes

    When the limit on the number of FDs is very high, closing all unwanted FDs
    after calling fork() can take a lot of time and delay the start of the
    child process. libvirt will now use an optimized algorithm that minimizes
    such delays.
* **Bug fixes**

  + logging: Ensure virtlogd rollover takes priority over logrotate

    virtlogd implements its own rollover mechanism, but until now logrotate
    could end up acting on the logs before virtlogd had a chance to do so
    itself.

# v5.5.0 (2019-07-02)[¶](#v5-5-0-2019-07-02 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + api: Prevent access to several APIs over read-only connections

    Certain APIs give root-equivalent access to the host, and as such should be
    limited to privileged users. CVE-2019-10161, CVE-2019-10166,
    CVE-2019-10167, CVE-2019-10168.
* **New features**

  + qemu: Support SMMUv3 IOMMU

    SMMUv3 is an IOMMU implementation for ARM virt guests.
  + network: Introduce the network port API

    This new public API can be used by virtualization drivers to manage network
    resources associated with guests, and is a further step towards splitting
    libvirtd into multiple daemons.
* **Removed features**

  + qemu: Remove support for virDomainQemuAttach and
    virConnectDomainXMLFromNative APIs

    The qemu implementations for the APIs mentioned above were removed and the
    APIs now return an error. The implementation was stale for a long time and
    did not work with modern QEMU command lines, generated from libvirt or
    otherwise.
  + Stop supporting migration of config files from pre-XDG layout

    The new layout was introduced with libvirt 0.9.13 (Jul 2012).
  + Remove Avahi mDNS support

    This feature was never used outside of virt-manager, which has itself
    stopped using it a while ago.
* **Improvements**

  + sysinfo: Report SMBIOS information on aarch64

    While SMBIOS support has historically been limited to x86\_64, modern
    aarch64 machines often offer access to the same information as well, and
    libvirt now exposes it to the user when that's the case.
  + test driver: Expand API coverage

    Even more APIs that were missing from the test driver have now been
    implemented.
  + virt-xml-validate: Allow input to be read from stdin
  + qemu: Validate spapr-vio addresses as 32-bit

    libvirt has always considered these addresses (used for pSeries guests) as
    64-bit, but the sPAPR specification says that they're 32-bit instead.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Set process affinity correctly when using <numatune>

    libvirt would mistakenly interpret the nodeset attribute as a list of
    CPUs instead of as a list of NUMA node, and the process affinity would be
    set incorrectly as a result; this has now been fixed.

# v5.4.0 (2019-06-03)[¶](#v5-4-0-2019-06-03 "Link to this headline")

* **Security**

  + cpu: Introduce support for the md-clear CPUID bit

    This bit is set when microcode provides the mechanism to invoke a flush of
    various exploitable CPU buffers by invoking the x86 VERW instruction.
    CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091.
  + Restrict user access to virt-admin, virtlogd and virtlockd

    The intended users for these facilities are the root user and the
    libvirtd service respectively, but these restrictions were not enforced
    correctly. CVE-2019-10132.
* **Improvements**

  + test driver: Expand API coverage

    Several APIs that were missing from the test driver have now been
    implemented.
  + Avoid unnecessary static linking

    Most binaries shipped as part of libvirt, for example virtlogd and
    libvirt\_iohelper , were embedding parts of the library even though they
    also linked against the libvirt.so dynamic library. This is no longer
    the case, which results in both the disk and memory footprint being
    reduced.
  + qemu: Report stat-htlb-pgalloc and stat-htlb-pgfail balloon stats

    These stats have been introduced in QEMU 3.0.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix emulator scheduler support

    Setting the scheduler for QEMU's main thread before QEMU had a chance to
    start up other threads was misleading as it would affect other threads
    (vCPU and I/O) as well. In some particular situations this could also lead
    to an error when the thread for vCPU #0 was being moved to its cpu,cpuacct
    cgroup. This was fixed so that the scheduler for the main thread is set
    after QEMU starts.
  + apparmor: Allow hotplug of vhost-scsi devices

# v5.3.0 (2019-05-04)[¶](#v5-3-0-2019-05-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for setting the emulator scheduler parameters

    I/O threads and vCPU threads already support setting schedulers, but until
    now it was impossible to do so for the main QEMU thread (emulator thread in
    the libvirt naming). This is, however, requested for some very specific
    scenarios, for example when vCPU threads are running at such priority that
    could starve the main thread.
* **Removed features**

  + vbox: Drop support for VirtualBox 4.x releases

    Support for all the 4.x releases was ended by VirtualBox maintainers in
    December 2015. Therefore, libvirt support for these releases is dropped.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Use PCI by default for RISC-V guests

    PCI support for RISC-V guests was already available in libvirt 5.1.0, but
    it required the user to opt-in by manually assigning PCI addresses: with
    this release, RISC-V guests will use PCI automatically when running against
    a recent enough (4.0.0+) QEMU release.
  + qemu: Advertise firmware autoselection in domain capabilities

    The firmware autoselection feature is now exposed in domain capabilities
    and management applications can query for accepted values, i.e. values that
    are accepted and for which libvirt found firmware descriptor files.
    Firmware Secure Boot support is also advertised.
  + Drop YAJL 1 support

    YAJL 2 is widely adopted and maintaining side by side support for two
    versions is unnecessary.
* **Bug fixes**

  + rpc: cleanup in virNetTLSContextNew

    Failed new gnutls context allocations in virNetTLSContextNew function
    results in double free and segfault. Occasional memory leaks may also
    occur.
  + virsh: various completers fixes

    There were some possible crashers, memory leaks, etc. which are now fixed.
  + qemu: Make hugepages work with memfd backend

    Due to a bug in command line generation libvirt did not honor hugepages
    setting with memfd backend.
  + Enforce ACL write permission for getting guest time & hostname

    Getting the guest time and hostname both require use of guest agent
    commands. These must not be allowed for read-only users, so the permissions
    check must validate "write" permission not "read".

# v5.2.0 (2019-04-03)[¶](#v5-2-0-2019-04-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Add Storage Pool Capabilities output

    Add support to list an enumerated list of supported Storage Pools via the
    virConnectGetCapabilities API when connected via a Storage Driver. Add
    support to get a more detailed list XML output Storage Pool Capabilities
    vis the virConnectGetStoragePoolCapabilites API.
  + qemu: Support virtio-{non-}transitional device models

    virtio-transitional and virtio-non-transitional model values
    were added to the QEMU driver for the following devices: disk ,
    interface , filesystem , rng , vsock , memballoon ,
    controller type scsi , controller type virtio-serial ,
    input bus virtio type passthrough , hostdev type
    scsi\_host . These new models can be used to give fine grained control
    over what virtio device version is presented to the guest.
  + qemu: Enable firmware autoselection

    Libvirt allows users to provide loader path for some time now. However,
    this puts some burden on users because they need to know what firmware
    meets their requirements. Now that QEMU ships firmware description files
    this burden can be moved onto libvirt. It is as easy as setting the
    firmware attribute in the os element (accepted values are bios
    and efi ). Moreover, libvirt automatically enables domain features
    needed for firmware it chooses.
  + snapshots: Add support for topological listings

    A new flag VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_LIST\_TOPOLOGICAL is available for the
    various snapshot listing APIs such as virDomainListAllSnapshots(). For
    drivers that support the flag, the listed snapshots are guaranteed to be
    sorted such that parents occur before children.
  + Xen: Add support for max grant frames setting

    Add support for Xen's max\_grant\_frames setting by adding a new xenbus
    controller type with a maxGrantFrames attribute. E.g. <controller type='xenbus' maxGrantFrames='64'/>
  + qemu: Add support for parallel migration

    With QEMU 4.0.0 libvirt can enable parallel migration which causes the
    memory pages to be processed in parallel by several threads and sent to the
    destination host using several connections at the same time. This may
    increase migration speed in case a single thread is unable to saturate the
    network link.
* **Removed features**

  + Drop support for Upstart and "Red Hat" init scripts

    Not a single one of the platforms we target still uses Upstart, and the
    Upstart project itself has been abandoned for several years now; the same
    is true for the "Red Hat" (really System V) init scripts, since RHEL 7 and
    later releases use systemd.
* **Improvements**

  + Report class information for PCI node device capability.
  + Split setup of IPv4 and IPv6 top level chain

    The requirement resulting from private chains improvement done in
    v5.1.0 was refined so that only tables from corresponding IP version
    are required. This means that if a network doesn't have IPv6 enabled
    then those tables are not required.
  + Don't default to building the QEMU driver

    Historically, the QEMU driver has been special in that it was enabled by
    default, with the option to explicitly opt-out of it; starting now, we're
    enabling it opportunistically if we detect that all requirements are
    available, just like we do with other drivers.
* **Bug fixes**

  + virt-host-validate: Fix IOMMU check on s390x
  + qemu: Allow creating pSeries guests with graphics and no USB mouse

    It's now possible to prevent libvirt from automatically adding a USB mouse
    to pSeries guests by including a USB tablet in the input XML: doing so is
    desiderable as using a tablet results in a much better user experience when
    working with GUIs.
  + qemu: Set $HOME and XGD variables for qemu:///system guests

    This avoids files being accidentally created under / or the guests not
    being able to start because they lack the necessary permissions to write to
    that location.

# v5.1.0 (2019-03-04)[¶](#v5-1-0-2019-03-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + bhyve: Add support for additional command-line arguments

    The bhyve driver now supports passing additional command-line arguments to
    the bhyve process using the new <bhyve:commandline> element in domain
    configuration.
  + network: Support setting a firewalld "zone" for virtual network bridges

    All libvirt virtual networks with bridges managed by libvirt (i.e. those
    with forward mode of "nat", "route", "open", or no forward mode) will now
    be placed in a special firewalld zone called "libvirt" by default. The zone
    of any network bridge can be changed using the zone attribute of the
    network's bridge element.
  + bhyve: Support for ignoring unknown MSRs reads and writes

    A new <features> element <msrs unknown='ignore'/> was introduced and the
    bhyve driver supports it to control unknown Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
    reads and writes.
  + qemu: Add support for encrypted VNC TLS keys

    Use the password stored in the secret driver under the uuid specified by
    the vnc\_tls\_x509\_secret\_uuid option in qemu.conf.
  + Add storage pool namespace options

    Allow for adjustment of RBD configuration options via Storage Pool XML
    Namespace adjustments.
  + qemu: Add support for setting post-copy migration bandwidth

    Users can now limit the bandwidth of post-copy migration, e.g. via virsh migrate --postcopy-bandwidth .
* **Improvements**

  + Create private chains for virtual network firewall rules

    Historically firewall rules for virtual networks were added straight into
    the base chains. This works but has a number of bugs and design
    limitations. To address them, libvirt now puts firewall rules into its own
    chains. Note that with this change the filter , nat and mangle
    tables are required for both IPv4 and IPv6 .
  + Detect CEPH and GPFS as shared FS

    When starting a migration libvirt performs some sanity checks to make sure
    domain will be able to run on the destination. One of the requirements is
    that the disk has to either be migrated too or be accessible from a network
    filesystem. CEPH and GPFS weren't detected as a network filesystem.
  + Advertise network MTU via DHCP when specified

    If network MTU is set and the network has DHCP enabled, advertise the MTU
    in DHCP transaction too so that clients can adjust their link accordingly.
  + qemu: Allocate memory at the configured NUMA nodes from start

    Libvirt used to just start QEMU, let it allocate memory for the guest, and
    then use CGroups to move the memory to configured NUMA nodes. This is
    suboptimal as huge chunks of memory have to be moved. Moreover, this relies
    on ability to move memory later which is not always true. A change was made
    to set process affinity correctly from the start so that memory is
    allocated on the configured nodes from the beginning.
  + Support for newer Wireshark

    Adapt libvirt to use the more recent release requiring a source build
    configuration of libvirt --with-wireshark to upgrade to the more recent
    version.
  + Batch mode virsh and virt-admin parsing improvements

    When parsing a single-argument command\_string in batch mode, virsh and
    virt-admin now permit newlines in addition to semicolons for splitting
    commands, and backslash-newline for splitting long lines, to be more like
    shell parsing.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Use CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE during QEMU capabilities probing

    By default, libvirt runs the QEMU process as qemu:qemu which could
    cause issues during probing as some features like AMD SEV might be
    inaccessible to QEMU because of file system permissions. Therefore,
    CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE is granted to overcome these for the purposes of
    probing.
  + storage: Add default mount options for fs/netfs storage pools

    Altered the command line generation for fs/netfs storage pools to add some
    default options. For Linux based systems, the options added are "nodev,
    nosuid, noexec". For FreeBSD based systems, the options added are "nosuid,
    noexec".
  + qemu: Allow use of PCI for RISC-V guests

    This works with QEMU 4.0.0+ only and is opt-in at the moment, since it
    requires users to manually assign PCI addresses, but is otherwise fully
    functional.
  + network: Fix virtual networks on systems using firewalld+nftables

    Because of the transitional state of firewalld's new support for nftables,
    not all iptables features required by libvirt are yet available, so libvirt
    must continue to use iptables for its own packet filtering rules even when
    the firewalld backend is set to use nftables. However, due to the way
    iptables support is implemented in kernels using nftables (iptables rules
    are converted to nftables rules and processed in a separate hook from the
    native nftables rules), guest networking was broken on hosts with firewalld
    configured to use nftables as the backend. This has been fixed by putting
    libvirt-managed bridges in their own firewalld zone, so that guest traffic
    can be forwarded beyond the host and host services can be exposed to guests
    on the virtual network without opening up those same services to the rest
    of the physical network. This means that host access from virtual machines
    is no longer controlled by the firewalld default zone (usually "public"),
    but rather by the new firewalld zone called "libvirt" (unless configured
    otherwise using the new zone attribute of the network bridge element).
  + qemu: Fix i6300esb watchdog hotplug on Q35

    Ensure that libvirt allocates a PCI address for the device so that QEMU did
    not default to an address that would not allow for device hotplug.
  + lxc: Don't reboot host on virDomainReboot

    If the container is really a simple one (init is just bash and the whole
    root is passed through) then virDomainReboot and virDomainShutdown would
    reboot or shutdown the host. The solution is to use different method to
    reboot or shutdown the container in that case (e.g. signal).
  + rpc: Various stream fixes

    One particular race was fixed, one locking problem and error reporting from
    streams was made better.
  + qemu: Fix guestfwd hotplug/hotunplug

    Fixed the generation of the guestfwd hotplug/unplug command sent to QEMU to
    match the syntax used when creating the initial command line.
  + qemu: Forbid CDROMs on virtio bus

    Attempting to create an empty virtio-blk drive or attempting to eject it
    results into an error. Forbid configurations where users would attempt to
    use CDROMs in virtio bus.
  + qemu: Use 'raw' for 'volume' disks without format

    Storage pools might want to specify format of the image when translating
    the volume thus libvirt can't add any default format when parsing the XML.
    Add an explicit format when starting the VM and format is not present
    neither by user specifying it nor by the storage pool translation function.
  + qemu: Assume 'raw' default storage format also for network storage

    Post parse callback adds the 'raw' type only for local files. Remote files
    can also have backing store (even local) so we should do this also for
    network backed storage.
  + qemu: Fix block job progress reporting and advocate for READY event

    In some cases QEMU can get to 100% and still not reach the synchronised
    phase. Initiating a pivot in that case will fail. Therefore it is strongly
    advised to wait for VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_JOB\_READY event which does not
    suffer from this problem.
  + qemu: Don't format image properties for empty drive

    If a -drive has no image, then formatting attributes such as cache,
    readonly, etc. would cause errors to be reported from QEMU. This was fixed
    by not supplying the attributes for devices without an image.
  + External snapshot metadata redefinition is fixed

    Attempting to use VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_CREATE\_REDEFINE to reinstate the
    metadata describing an external snapshot created earlier for an offline
    domain no longer fails.

# v5.0.0 (2019-01-15)[¶](#v5-0-0-2019-01-15 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Xen: Add support for openvswitch

    The libxl driver now supports virtual interfaces that connect to an
    openvswitch bridge, including interfaces with VLAN tagging and trunking
    configuration.
  + qemu: Report whether KVM nesting is available

    Running nested KVM guests requires specific configuration steps to be
    performed on the host; libvirt will now report in the host capabilities
    whether KVM nesting support is available.
* **Removed features**

  + Drop UML driver

    The UML driver was unmaintained and not tested for quite some time now.
    Worse, there is a bug that causes it to deadlock on some very basic
    operations (e.g. dumping domain XML). These facts make us believe no one
    uses it.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Add support for ARMv6l guests
  + Support more NVDIMM configuration options

    Introduce more configuration options. For the source element, add the
    'alignsize' and 'pmem' subelements. For the target element, add the
    'readonly' subelement.
  + cpu: Add support for "stibp" x86\_64 feature

    Add cpu flag stibp (Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors) to prevent
    indirect branch predictions from being controlled by the sibling
    Hyperthread.
  + libxl: Handle external domain destroy

    Historically, if a domain was destroyed using xl rather than through
    libvirt APIs, libvirt would not be aware of the fact and keep considering
    it as running. This is no longer the case.
  + Start selecting the first available DRI device for OpenGL operations

    If OpenGL support is needed (either with SPICE gl enabled or with
    egl-headless), libvirt is now able to pick the first available DRI device
    for the job. At the same time, this improvement is also a bugfix as it
    prevents permission-related issues with regards to our mount namespaces and
    the default DRI render node's permissions which would normally prevent QEMU
    from accessing such a device.
  + qemu: Add support for postcopy-requests migration statistics

    The virDomainJobInfo can get number page requests received from the
    destination host during post-copy migration.
* **Bug fixes**

  + lxc: Don't forbid interfaces with type=direct

    Such interfaces are supported by lxc and should be allowed.
  + qemu: Fully clean up RNG devices on detach

    Some RNG device types, such as those using EGD, might need extra clean up
    on the host in addition to removing the guest-side device.

# v4.10.0 (2018-12-03)[¶](#v4-10-0-2018-12-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add Hyper-V PV IPI and Enlightened VMCS support

    The QEMU driver now has support for Hyper-V PV IPI and Enlightened VMCS for
    Windows and Hyper-V guests.
  + qemu: Added support for PCI devices on S390

    PCI addresses can now include the new zpci element which contains uid
    (user-defined identifier) and fid (PCI function identifier) attributes and
    makes the corresponding devices usable by S390 guests.
  + Support changing IOThread polling parameters for a live guest

    Introduced virDomainSetIOThreadParams which allows dynamically setting the
    IOThread polling parameters used by QEMU to manage the thread polling
    interval and the algorithm for growth or shrink of the polling time. The
    values only affect a running guest with IOThreads. The guest's IOThread
    polling values can be viewed via the domain statistics.
  + Xen: Add support for PVH

    The libxl driver now supports Xen's PVH virtual machine type. PVH machines
    are enabled with the new "xenpvh" OS type, e.g.
    <os><type>xenpvh</type></os>
  + qemu: Added support for CMT (Cache Monitoring Technology)

    Introduced cache monitoring using the monitor element in cachetune
    for vCPU threads. Added interfaces to get and display the cache utilization
    statistics through the command 'virsh domstats' via the
    virConnectGetAllDomainStats API.
  + qemu: Add support for nested HV for pSeries guests

    Nested HV support makes it possible to run nested (L2) guests with minimal
    performance penalty when compared to regular (L1) guests on ppc64 hardware.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Xen: Handle soft reset shutdown event

    The pvops Linux kernel uses soft reset to handle the crash machine
    operation. The libxl driver now supports the soft reset shutdown event,
    allowing proper crash handling of pvops-based HVM domains.

# v4.9.0 (2018-11-04)[¶](#v4-9-0-2018-11-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + util: Add cgroup v2 support

    cgroup v2 support has been implemented in libvirt, with both "unified" (v2
    only) and "hybrid" (v2 + v1) setups being usable; existing "legacy" (v1
    only) setups will keep working.
  + qemu: Add vfio AP support

    The QEMU driver now has support to passthrough adjunct processors into QEMU
    guests on S390.
* **Improvements**

  + rpc: Make 'genprotocol' output reproducible

    This is another step towards making libvirt builds fully reproducible.
* **Bug fixes**

  + security: Fix permissions for UNIX sockets

    Since 4.5.0, libvirt is using FD passing to hand sockets over to QEMU,
    which in theory removes the need for them to be accessible by the user
    under which the QEMU process is running; however, other processes such as
    vdsm need to access the sockets as well, which means adjusting permissions
    is still necessary.
  + cpu\_map: Add Icelake model definitions

    These CPU models will be available in the upcoming 3.1.0 QEMU release.
  + util: Properly parse URIs with missing trailing slash

    Some storage URIs were not parsed correctly, in which case libvirt ended up
    emitting XML that it would then refuse to parse back.

# v4.8.0 (2018-10-01)[¶](#v4-8-0-2018-10-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Xen: Support PM Suspend and Wakeup

    The libxl driver now supports the virDomainPMSuspendForDuration and
    virDomainPMWakeup APIs.
* **Removed features**

  + Xen: Drop support for Xen 4.4 and 4.5

    Xen 4.4 and 4.5 are no longer supported by the Xen community. Drop support
    for these older versions and require Xen >= 4.6.
  + nwfilter: Disallow binding creation in session mode

    Ensure that a filter binding creation is not attempted in session mode and
    generates a proper error message.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Retrieve guest hostname through QEMU Guest Agent command

    QEMU is now able to retrieve the guest hostname using a new QEMU-GA command
    called 'guest-get-host-name'. Virsh users can execute 'domhostname' for
    QEMU driver for domains configured to use the Guest Agent.
  + virsh: Implement vsh-table in virsh and virsh-admin

    The new API fixes problems with table-alignment, making the tables more
    readable and deals with unicode.
* **Bug fixes**

  + storage: Allow inputvol to be encrypted

    When creating a storage volume based on another volume, the base input
    volume is allowed to be encrypted.
  + virsh: Require explicit --domain for domxml-to-native

    The --domain option for domxml-to-native virsh command has always been
    documented as required, but commit v4.3.0-127-gd86531daf2 accidentally made
    it optional.
  + lxc\_monitor: Avoid AB / BA lock race

    A deadlock situation could occur when autostarting a LXC domain 'guest' due
    to two threads attempting to take opposing locks while holding opposing
    locks (AB BA problem).

# v4.7.0 (2018-09-03)[¶](#v4-7-0-2018-09-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + storage: add storage pool iscsi-direct

    Introduce a new storage pool backend that uses libiscsi instead of
    iscsiadm. It support basic pool operations: checkPool and refreshPool.
  + Add support for MBA (Memory Bandwidth Allocation technology)

    Domain vCPU threads can now have allocated some parts of host memory
    bandwidth by using the memorytune element in cputune .
  + qemu: Add support for RISC-V guests

    riscv32 and riscv64 guest architectures are now supported.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Add ccw support for vhost-vsock

    Support the vhost-vsock-ccw device on S390.
  + qemu: Make default machine type independent of QEMU

    We can't control whether or not QEMU will change its default machine type
    in the future, or whether downstream distributions will decide to compile
    out some machine types, so our only option to provide a predictable
    behavior is taking care of the default ourselves; management applications
    and users are encouraged to explicitly pick a machine type when creating
    new guests.
  + apparmor: Various improvements

    Rules have been added to deal with a number of scenarios that didn't work
    correctly.
* **Bug fixes**

  + esx: Truncate CPU model name

    Some CPU model names are too long to be stored into the corresponding
    property, and should be explicitly truncated to avoid unexpected behavior
    in users of the virNodeGetInfo() API such as virsh nodeinfo .
  + utils: Remove arbitrary limit on socket\_id/core\_id

    Both values were assumed to be smaller than 4096, but in fact they are
    entirely hardware-dependent and there have been reports of machines
    presenting much bigger values, preventing libvirt from working correctly;
    all such limits have now been removed.

# v4.6.0 (2018-08-06)[¶](#v4-6-0-2018-08-06 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Implement the HTM pSeries feature

    Users can now decide whether HTM (Hardware Transactional Memory) support
    should be available to the guest.
  + qemu: Enable VNC console for mediated devices

    Host devices now support a new attribute 'display' which can be used to
    turn on frame buffer rendering on a vgpu mediated device instead of on an
    emulated GPU, like QXL.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Introduce a new video model of type 'none'

    Introduce a new video model type that disables the automatic addition of a
    video device to domains with 'graphics' specified in their XML. This can be
    useful with GPU mediated devices which can serve as the only rendering
    devices within the guest.
  + virsh: Add --alias to attach-disk and attach-interface commands

    Add option --alias to set customized device alias name when using
    attach-disk or attach-interface commands.
  + virsh: Support usb and sata address to attach-disk

    Usb or sata address could be used when attach-disk with --address. For
    example, use usb address as usb:<bus>.<port>, use sata address as
    <controller>.<bus>.<unit>.

# v4.5.0 (2018-07-02)[¶](#v4-5-0-2018-07-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Provide TPM emulator support

    Support QEMU's TPM emulator based on swtpm. Each QEMU guest gets its own
    virtual TPM.
  + bhyve: Support specifying guest CPU topology

    Bhyve's guest CPU topology could be specified using the <cpu><topology ../></cpu> element.
  + qemu: Add support for extended TSEG size

    Support specifying extended TSEG size for SMM in QEMU.
  + qemu: Add support for SEV guests

    SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is a feature available on AMD CPUs
    that encrypts the guest memory and makes it inaccessible even to the host
    OS.
* **Removed features**

  + Remove support for qcow/default encrypted volumes

    Disallow using a qcow encrypted volume for the guest and disallow creation
    of the qcow or default encrypted volume from the storage driver. Support
    for qcow encrypted volumes has been phasing out since QEMU 2.3 and by QEMU
    2.9 creation of a qcow encrypted volume via qemu-img required usage of
    secret objects, but that support was never added to libvirt.
  + Make GnuTLS mandatory

    Building without GnuTLS is no longer possible.
  + qemu: Remove allow\_disk\_format\_probing configuration option

    The option represented a security risk when used with malicious disk
    images, so users were recommended against enabling it; with this release,
    it's been removed altogether.
* **Improvements**

  + capabilities: Provide info about host IOMMU support

    Capabilities XML now provide information about host IOMMU support.
  + virsh: Add --all to domblkinfo command

    Alter the domblkinfo command to add the option --all in order to
    display the size details of each domain block device from one command in a
    output table.
  + qemu: Allow concurrent access to monitor and guest agent

    Historically libvirt prevented concurrent accesses to the qemu monitor and
    the guest agent. Therefore two independent calls (one querying the monitor
    and the other querying guest agent) would serialize which hurts
    performance. The code was reworked to allow two independent calls run at
    the same time.
  + qemu: Allow configuring the page size for HPT pSeries guests

    For HPT pSeries guests, the size of the host pages used to back guest
    memory and the usable guest page sizes are connected; the new setting can
    be used to request that a certain page size is available in the guest.
  + Add support to use an raw input volume for encryption

    It is now possible to provide a raw input volume as input for to generate a
    luks encrypted volume via either virsh vol-create-from or
    virStorageVolCreateXMLFrom.
  + qemu: Add support for vsock hot (un)plug and cold (un)plug
  + qemu: Add support for NBD over TLS

    NBD volumes can now be accessed securely.
  + qemu: Implement FD passing for Unix sockets

    Instead of having QEMU open the socket and then connecting to it, which is
    inherently racy, starting with QEMU 2.12 we can open the socket ourselves
    and pass it to QEMU, avoiding race conditions.
  + virsh: Introduce --nowait option for domstat command

    When this option is specified, virsh will try to fetch the guest stats but
    abort instead of stalling if they can't be retrieved right away.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Fix a potential libvirtd crash on VM reconnect

    Initialization of the driver worker pool needs to come before libvirtd
    trying to reconnect to all machines, since one of the QEMU processes migh
    have already emitted events which need to be handled prior to us getting to
    the worker pool initialization.
  + qemu: Fix domain resume after failed migration

    Recent versions of QEMU activate block devices before the guest CPU has
    been started, which makes it impossible to roll back a failed migration.
    Use the late-block-activate migration capability if supported to avoid
    the issue.
  + vmx: Permit guests to have an odd number of vCPUs

    An odd number of vCPUs greater than 1 was forbidden in the past, but
    current versions of ESXi have lifted that restriction.

# v4.4.0 (2018-06-04)[¶](#v4-4-0-2018-06-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + bhyve: Support locking guest memory

    Bhyve's guest memory may be wired using the
    <memoryBacking><locked/></memoryBacking> element.
  + qemu: Provide VFIO channel I/O passthrough support

    Support passthrough devices that use channel I/O based mechanism in a QEMU
    virtual machine.
  + qemu: Add support for migration of VMs with non-shared storage over TLS

    It's now possible to use the VIR\_MIGRATE\_TLS flag together with
    VIR\_MIGRATE\_NON\_SHARED\_DISK. The connection is then secured using the TLS
    environment which is setup for the migration connection.
  + Add support for VM Generation ID

    The VM Generatation ID exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically random, integer
    value identifier, referred to as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to the
    guest in order to notify the guest operating system when the virtual
    machine is executed with a different configuration. Add a new domain XML
    processing and a domain capabilities feature.
  + Introduce virDomainDetachDeviceAlias

    This new API enables users to detach device using only its alias.
  + Introduce new virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU and
    virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU APIs

    Unlike the old virConnectCompareCPU and virConnectBaselineCPU APIs, both
    new APIs consider capabilities of a specific hypervisor.
  + Introduce SCSI persistent reservations support

    The QEMU driver gained support for qemu-pr-helper which enables guests to
    issue SCSI commands for persistent reservation.
  + qemu: Implement multiple screen support for virDomainScreenshot

    While the virDomainScreenshot API supported multihead video cards, the
    implementation was missing. But now that QEMU implemented it libvirt has
    done as well.
  + qemu: add support for vhost-vsock-device

    A new vsock device was introduced, allowing communication between the guest
    and the host via the AF\_VSOCK family.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Add support for OpenGL rendering with SDL

    Domains using SDL as a graphics backend will now be able to use OpenGL
    accelerated rendering.
  + qemu: Add support for 'output' audio codec

    Support QEMU's 'hda-output' codec advertising only a line-out for ich6 and
    ich9 sound devices.
  + virsh: Enhance event name completion

    Implement event name completion for some commands (e.g. event,
    secret-event, pool-event and nodedev-event)

# v4.3.0 (2018-05-02)[¶](#v4-3-0-2018-05-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for the pcie-to-pci-bridge controller

    Pure PCIe guests such as x86\_64/q35 and aarch64/virt will now add this
    controller when traditional PCI devices are in use.
  + Xen: Support setting CPU features for host-passthrough model

    The CPU model presented to Xen HVM domains is equivalent to libvirt's
    host-passthrough model, although individual features can be enabled and
    disabled via the cpuid setting. The libvirt libxl driver now supports
    enabling and disabling individual features of the host-passthrough CPU
    model.
* **Removed features**

  + Xen: Drop the legacy xend-based driver

    The xm/xend toolstack was deprecated in Xen 4.2 and removed from the Xen
    sources in the 4.5 development cycle. The libvirt driver based on xend is
    now removed from the libvirt sources.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Support hot plug and hot unplug of mediated devices

    Libvirt now allows mediated devices to be hot plugged and hot unplugged
    from a guest rather than reporting an error that this isn't supported. In
    fact, kernel has been supporting this since 4.10.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Improve handling of device mapper targets

    When starting a domain with a disk backed by a device mapper volume libvirt
    also needs to allow the storage backing the device mapper in CGroups. In
    the past kernel did not care, but starting from 4.16 CGroups are consulted
    on each access to the device mapper target.

# v4.2.0 (2018-04-01)[¶](#v4-2-0-2018-04-01 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Support building with Python 3

    Python is required to build libvirt, and up until now only Python 2 could
    be used as an interpreter. All scripts used during build have now been made
    compatible with Python 3, which means both major releases of the language
    are fully supported.
  + qemu: Provide ccw address support for graphics and input devices

    Support the virtio-gpu-ccw device as a video device and virtio-{keyboard,
    mouse, tablet}-ccw devices as input devices on S390.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Add logging of guest crash information on S390

    On S390, when the guest crashes and QEMU exposes the guest crash
    information, log the relevant data to the domain log file.
  + qemu: use arp table of host to get the IP address of guests

    Find IP address of a VM by arp table on hosts. If someone customizing IP
    address inside VM, it will be helpful.
  + Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight

    The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain scheduler
    weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided <shares> in
    <cputune> . The driver now honors <shares> , and defers setting a
    default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any domains
    started after this improvement will have one fourth the shares of
    previously started domains. If all domains must have equal CPU shares,
    administrators must manually set the weight of previously started domains
    to 256, or restart them.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: TLS migration now enforces use of TLS for the NBD connection

    When the VIR\_MIGRATE\_TLS flag was used with the migration API libvirt did
    not ensure that the NBD connection was using TLS as well. The code now
    rejects such migration as the TLS transport for NBD is not ready yet, but
    prevents a false sense of security that TLS would be used. The support TLS
    for NBD will be added soon.

# v4.1.0 (2018-03-05)[¶](#v4-1-0-2018-03-05 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Added support for CAT (Cache allocation Technology)

    Domain vCPU threads can now have allocated some parts of host cache using
    the cachetune element in cputune .
  + Allow opening secondary drivers

    Up until now it was possible to connect to only hypervisor drivers (e.g.
    qemu:///system, lxc:///, vbox:///system, and so on). The internal drivers
    (like network driver, node device driver, etc.) were hidden from users and
    users could use them only indirectly. Starting with this release new
    connection URIs are accepted. For instance network:///system,
    storage:///system and so on.
  + virtlogd, virtlockd: Add support for admin protocol

    These two daemons now support admin protocol through which some admin info
    can be gathered or some configuration tweaked on the fly.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: Enhance bash completion

    Implement more bash completions so that basic libvirt objects can be
    auto-completed (e.g. networks, interfaces, NWFilters, and so on).
  + qemu: Use VIR\_ERR\_DEVICE\_MISSING for various hotplug/detach messages
  + qemu: Allow showing the dump progress for memory only dump

    Alter the QEMU dump-guest-memory command processing to check for and allow
    asynchronous completion which then allows for the virsh dump --memory-only
    --verbose command to display percent completion data.
  + conf: add support for setting Chassis SMBIOS data fields
  + libxl: add support for setting clock offset and adjustment
  + Make port allocator global

    Up until now each driver had their own port allocator module. This meant
    that info on port usage was not shared. Starting with this release, the
    port allocator module is made global and therefore drivers allocate ports
    from global pool.
  + Fixed some compiler warnings that appear with GCC 8
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Check for unsafe migration more thoroughly

    If a domain disk is stored on local filesystem (e.g. ext4) but is not being
    migrated it is very likely that domain is not able to run on destination.
    Regardless of share/cache mode.
  + qemu: Fix updating device with boot order

    Starting with 3.7.0 release updating any device with boot order would fail
    with 'boot order X is already used by another device' while in fact it was
    the very same device.
  + virlog: determine the hostname on startup CVE-2018-6764

    At later point it might not be possible or even safe to use getaddrinfo().
    It can in turn result in a load of NSS module which can even be loaded from
    unsage guest filesystem and thus escape the confinment of its container.
  + qemu: Rework vCPU statistics fetching

    Fetching vCPU statistics was very expensive because it lead to waking up
    vCPU threads in QEMU and thus it degraded performance. The code was
    reworked so that fetching statistics does not wake up halted vCPUs.
  + qemu: unlink memory backing file on domain shutdown

    Depending on the filesystem where domain memory is stored, some files might
    have been left behind. This is not a problem on hugetlbfs, but it is a
    problem on regular filesystems like ext4.
  + qemu: Fix shutting down domains in parallel

    If multiple domains were being shut down in parallel, libvirtd might have
    deadlocked.
  + nodedev: Update PCI mdev capabilities dynamically

    PCI devices may have other nested capabilities, like SRIOV and mdev which
    depend on the device being plugged into the native vendor driver. However,
    in case such a device is directly assigned to a guest using VFIO driver,
    the device will naturally lose these capabilities and libvirt needs to
    reflect that.

# v4.0.0 (2018-01-19)[¶](#v4-0-0-2018-01-19 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + tools: Provide bash completion support

    Both virsh and virt-admin now implement basic bash completion
    support.
  + qemu: Refresh capabilities on host microcode update

    A microcode update can cause the CPUID bits to change; therefore, the
    capabilities cache should be rebuilt when such an update is detected on the
    host.
  + lxc: Set hostname based on container name
* **Improvements**

  + CPU frequency reporting improvements

    The CPU frequency will now be reported by virsh nodeinfo and other
    tools for s390 hosts; at the same time; CPU frequency has been disabled on
    aarch64 hosts because there's no way to detect it reliably.
  + libxl: Mark domain0 as persistent
  + Xen: Add support for multiple IP addresses on interface devices
  + qemu: Add support for hot unplugging redirdev device
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Enforce vCPU hotplug granularity constraints

    QEMU 2.7 and newer don't allow guests to start unless the initial vCPUs
    count is a multiple of the vCPU hotplug granularity, so validate it and
    report an error if needed.

# v3.10.0 (2017-12-04)[¶](#v3-10-0-2017-12-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + conf: Support defining distances between virtual NUMA cells

    A NUMA hardware architecture supports the notion of distances between NUMA
    cells. This can now be specified using the <distances> element within
    the NUMA cell configuration. Drivers which support this include Xen and
    QEMU.
  + Xen: Support defining vNUMA topology

    Xen now supports defining a virtual NUMA topology for VMs, including
    specifying distances between NUMA cells.
  + qemu: Add the ability to configure HPT resizing for pSeries guests

    The user can now decide whether HPT (Hash Page Table) resizing should be
    enabled, disabled or required instead of leaving it up to hypervisor
    defaults and negotiation between the guest and the host.
  + qemu: Add vmcoreinfo feature

    Starting with QEMU 2.11, the guest can save kernel debug details when this
    feature is enabled and the kernel supports it. It is useful to process
    kernel dump with KASLR enabled, and also provides various kernel details to
    crash tools.
  + conf: Move the auth and encryption definitions to disk source

    Allow parsing and formatting of the auth and encryption
    sub-elements to be a child of the source element. This will allow
    adding an auth sub-element to a backingStore or mirror elements
    as a means to track specific authentication and/or encryption needs.
* **Improvements**

  + vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.2 support
  + vbox: Add support for configuring storage controllers

    The VirtualBox driver now supports the <controller> element in the
    domain XML for configuring storage controllers in VBOX VMs. Additionally,
    libvirt's domain XML schema was updated to allow optional model
    attribute for <controller type='ide'> which is used by the VBOX driver
    to set the IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
    'ich6'. Finally, with this change dumpxml generates <controller>
    elements that correspond to current VBOX VM storage controller
    configuration.
  + vbox: Add support for attaching empty removable disks

    The VirutalBox driver now supports adding CD-ROM and floppy disk devices
    that do not have the disk source specified. Previously such devices were
    silently ignored.
  + vbox: Add support for attaching SAS storage controllers

    In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas libvirt
    does not make such distinction. Therefore, the VBOX driver was updated to
    allow attaching SAS controllers via <controller type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'> element. If there are both SCSI and SAS controllers
    present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML can associate the disk device using
    the <address> element with the controller attribute, and
    optionally, set the port via unit attribute.
  + qemu: Generate predictable paths for qemu memory backends

    In some cases management applications need to know paths passed to
    memory-backend-file objects upfront. Libvirt now generates predictable
    paths so applications can prepare the files if they need to do so.
  + Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu

    Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption of
    disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the feature was
    turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing of those disks in
    qemu so that the image locking is not applied in that case. Additionally
    libvirt now checks that shareable disks have supported format (raw) to
    avoid metadata corruption.
  + Improve serial console behavior on non-x86 architectures

    ppc64, aarch64 and s390x guests were treating the <serial> and <console>
    elements differently from x86, in some cases presenting misleading
    information to the user. The behavior is now consistent across all
    architectures and the information reported is always accurate.
* **Bug fixes**

  + vbox: Do not ignore failures to attach disk devices when defining

    The define now fails and reports an error if any of the controller
    or disk devices specified in the domain XML fail to attach to the
    VirtualBox VM.
  + vbox: Fix dumpxml to always output disk devices

    The VirtualBox driver was ignoring any disk devices in dumpxml output
    if there was a SAS storage controller attached to the VM.
  + vbox: Fix dumpxml to always generate valid domain XML

    When a VirtualBox VM has multiple disks attached, each to a different
    storage controller that uses 'sd' prefix for block device names e.g. one
    disk attached to SATA and one to SCSI controller, it no longer generates
    XML where both would have 'sda' device name assigned. Instead it properly
    assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the order of appearance.
  + Securely pass iSCSI authentication data

    Rather than supplying the authentication data as part of the iSCSI URL for
    a disk or host device, utilize the encrypted secret object to securely pass
    the authentication data.

# v3.9.0 (2017-11-02)[¶](#v3-9-0-2017-11-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Add capability to allow hot (un)plug of a domain watchdog device
  + Allow users to set device aliases

    Users can set aliases to domain devices and thus identify them easily.
  + qemu: Support multiqueue for virtio-blk

    Multiqueue support for virtio-blk has been available in QEMU ever since
    2.7.0, and now libvirt guests can enable it.
  + Add virDomainSetLifecycleAction API

    Provided a new API to allow dynamic guest lifecycle control for guest
    reactions to poweroff, restart, or crash type events related to the domain
    XML on\_poweroff , on\_reboot , and on\_crash elements. The
    virsh set-lifecycle-action command was created to control the actions.
  + qemu: Allow cold(un)plugging and hot(un)plugging input devices
  + net: Implement QoS for vhostuser
* **Improvements**

  + Allow a logical volume to be create using LUKS

    A logical volume may be created using an encryption element using
    "luks" format. This does require a previously created secret to store
    the passphrase used to encrypt the volume Adding the volume to a domain can
    then either provide the secret or allow the consumer in the guest to
    provide the passphrase in order to decrypt the volume.
  + net: Ignore auto-generated MAC address when detaching an interface

    If the MAC address has not been specified by the user, libvirt will try and
    fill in the gaps by generating one; however, for some error paths that led
    to some confusing error messages, so when an auto-generated MAC address is
    specified the error message will not include the auto-generated MAC.
  + net: Enable MAC address lookup for virDomainInterfaceStats
  + apparmor: Several improvements

    Changes include permitting access to data about USB devices and dnsmasq
    instances, allowing spaces in guest names and many more.
  + cpu: Use CPU information obtained from QEMU when possible

    Recent QEMU versions can expose information about which CPU models are
    available and usable on the host; libvirt will now make use of such
    information whenever possible.
  + hyperv: Various improvements

    The error reported when clients can't connect to Hyper-V has been made more
    descriptive, and memory limits for guests are now mapped to more
    appropriate libvirt equivalents.
  + qemu: Report QEMU error on failed migration

    Instead of reporting a generic error, ask QEMU for a more detailed and thus
    hopefully more helpful one.
  + vbox: Implement autoport for RDP

    libvirt will now obtain the (dynamically allocated) RDP port number from
    VirtualBox itself, avoiding conflicts between multiple guests wanting to
    use RDP at the same time.
  + qemu: Allow rotation of small logs

    On a host where numerous unique instances are executed per day, it's quite
    possible that, even though each of the single log files are fairly small,
    collectively the quantity and volume may add tens of thousands of log files
    to the /var/log/libvirt/qemu/ directory. Removing the constraints that
    log have to be bigger than 100 KiB before they can be rotated solves the
    issue.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Fix swapped interface statistics and QoS

    Due to internal implementation, reported statistics for some types of
    interfaces were swapped (RX appeared in TX and vice versa). Similarly, QoS
    was set in reversed way.
  + Properly resize local LUKS encrypted volume

    Resizing of a local LUKS encrypted volume will now use qemu-img to resize
    the volume. This will require configuring a secret for the LUKS encrypted
    volume.
  + qemu: Reserve PCI addresses for implicit i440fx devices

    Failing to do so causes the addresses to be considered usable by libvirt,
    which means they could be assigned to more than one device resulting in the
    guest failing to start.
  + spec: Restart libvirtd only at the end of the upgrade process

    Use %posttrans to make sure libvirtd is not restarted before all
    other components, such as the library itself and storage / hypervisor
    drivers, have already been upgraded.
* **Security**

  + qemu: Ensure TLS clients always verify the server certificate

    While it's reasonable to turn off client certificate validation, as setting
    it up can be non-trivial, clients should always verify the server
    certificate to avoid MITM attacks. However, libvirt was using the same knob
    to control both checks, leading to CVE-2017-1000256 / LSN-2017-0002.

# v3.8.0 (2017-10-04)[¶](#v3-8-0-2017-10-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Added support for cold-(un)plug of watchdog devices
  + qemu: Added support for setting IP address os usernet interfaces
  + qemu: Added support for Veritas Hyperscale (VxHS) block devices
  + storage: Added new events for pool-build and pool-delete
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Set DAC permissions properly for spice rendernode

    When a rendernode path is set for SPICE GL on qemu:///system , we
    now correctly set DAC permissions on the device at VM startup. This is the
    last remaining hurdle to let SPICE GL work for qemu:///system without
    any external host changes.
  + nodedev: Add switchdev offload query to NIC capabilities

    Allow querying the NIC interface capabilities for the availability of
    switchdev offloading (also known as kernel-forward-plane-offload).
  + New CPU models for AMD and Intel

    AMD EPYC and Intel Skylake-Server CPU models were added together with their
    features
  + Improve long waiting when saving a domain

    While waiting for a write to disk to be finished, e.g. during save, even
    simple operations like virsh list would be blocking due to domain lock.
    This is now resolved by unlocking the domain in places where it is not
    needed.
* **Bug fixes**

  + Proper units are now used in virsh manpage for dom(mem)stats

    Previously the documentation used multiples of 1000, but now it is fixed to
    use multiples of 1024.
  + qemu: Fix error reporting when disk attachment fails

    There was a possibility for the actual error to be overridden or cleared
    during the rollback.
  + qemu: Fix assignment of graphics ports after daemon restart

    This could be seen with newer kernels that have bug regarding SO\_REUSEADDR.
    After libvirtd was restarted it could assign already used address to new
    guests which would make them fail to start. This is fixed by marking used
    ports unavailable when reconnecting to running QEMU domains.
  + Fix message decoding which was causing a very strange bug

    When parsing an RPC message with file descriptors was interrupted and had
    to restart, the offset of the payload was calculated badly causing strange
    issues like not being able to find a domain that was not requested.

# v3.7.0 (2017-09-04)[¶](#v3-7-0-2017-09-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add managedsave-edit commands

    Using managedsave-dumpxml, managedsave-define and managedsave-edit
    commands, now we can dump and edit the XML configuration of domain which
    has managedsave image.
  + qemu: Add migrate-getmaxdowntime command

    Currently, the maximum tolerable downtime for a domain being migrated is
    write-only from libvirt, via migrate-setmaxdowntime. This implements a
    complementary migrate-getmaxdowntime command
  + bhyve: Support autoport for VNC ports

    It's no longer necessary to explicitly specify VNC port for the bhyve
    guests. With the autoport feature it will be allocated automatically.
    Please refer to the bhyve driver documentation for examples.
  + qemu: Added support for setting heads of virtio GPU
  + qemu: Added support to configure reconnect timeout for chardev devices

    When you have a TCP or UNIX chardev device and it's connected somewhere you
    can configure reconnect timeout if the connection is closed.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Report a clear error when dropping a VM during startup

    "Failed to load config for domain 'DOMNAME'" is now reported if a VM config
    can't be parsed for some reason, and thus provides a clear indication for
    users (and devs).
  + apparmor: Update for QEMU 2.10 compatibility

    Starting with QEMU 2.10, disk images and NVRAM files get automatically
    locked to prevent them from being corrupted; however, file locking needs to
    be explicitly allowed through virt-aa-helper or AppArmor will reject
    the requests and the guest will not be able to run.
  + virsh: List Unix sockets in 'domdisplay' output

    VNC and SPICE graphics can use Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP sockets as
    connection endpoints, but such a configuration was not handled correctly by
    virsh domdisplay , causing the respective endpoints to be missing from
    the output.
  + qemu: Don't check whether offline migration is safe

    Since offline migration only copies the guest definition to the destination
    host, data corruption is not a concern and the operation can always be
    performed safely.
  + virt-host-validate: Fix IOMMU detection on ppc64
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Better support for international domain names (with wide characters)

    There were some issues with multi-byte domains getting lost on daemon
    restart due to truncation, so the code now handles multi-byte names a bit
    better.
  + qemu: Support long domain names with namespaces

    Domains with extremely long names would fail to start due to temporary
    namespace paths being created with the whole name. The path is now
    generated with shortened name instead.
  + qemu: Tolerate missing emulator binary during libvirtd restart

    For some time libvirt required qemu capabilities being present when parsing
    VM configs during startup. As a side effect VM configs would fail to parse
    and thus vanish, if the emulator binary would be uninstalled or broken.
    Libvirt now tolerates when capabilities are missing during startup.
  + qemu: Prevent pSeries guests from disappearing in some situations

    pSeries guest would disappear if any of the host devices they were
    configured to use was not available during libvirtd startup, which could
    easily happen for SR-IOV Virtual Functions. This scenario is now handled
    correctly.
  + qemu: Honor <on\_reboot/> setting

    The setting was accepted by the parser, but not actually implemented.
  + Fix --verbose option for all daemons

    Since v3.0.0, the option had been ignored by all libvirt daemons (
    libvirtd , virtlogd and virtlockd ); it's now working as
    intended once again.

# v3.6.0 (2017-08-02)[¶](#v3-6-0-2017-08-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + hyperv: Implement virDomainSetMemory and virDomainSendKey APIs
  + qemu: Support multiple PHBs for pSeries guests

    pSeries guests can now have multiple PHBs (PCI Host Bridges), which show up
    as separate PCI domains in the guest. To create additional PHBs, simply add
    PCI controllers with model pci-root to the guest configuration.
  + qemu: Isolate hostdevs on pSeries guests

    To enable better error reporting and recovery, unrelated hostdevs will now
    be automatically isolated on pSeries guests by placing them on separate
    PHBs (PCI Host Bridges).
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: platform serial devices can now use chardev features

    QEMU VMs that depend on platform serial devices can now use QEMU's
    -chardev option, which enables access to advanced features like log
    file configuration. This applies to the default serial devices for arm,
    aarch64, and some ppc configurations.
  + Require use of GCC 4.4 or Clang compilers

    We only ever test libvirt with GCC or Clang (which provides a GCC
    compatible compilation environment). Between them, these compilers cover
    every supported operating system platform, including Windows.
  + qemu: shared disks with directsync cache should be safe for migration

    At present shared disks can be migrated with either readonly or
    cache=none . But cache=directsync should be safe for migration,
    because both cache=directsync and cache=none don't use the host
    page cache, and cache=direct write through qemu block layer cache.
  + Handle hotplug change on VLAN configuration using OVS

    Libvirt was taught to handle VLAN change for running OVS interface.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Use vCPU 'node-id' property and pass it back to qemu

    vCPU properties gathered from query-hotpluggable-cpus need to be passed
    back to QEMU. As QEMU did not use the node-id property until now and
    libvirt forgot to pass it back properly (it was parsed but not passed
    around) we did not honor this.
  + Miscellaneous stream fixes

    After introducing sparse stream features there were still some known bugs
    left. Those are fixed in this release.
  + qemu: Miscellaneous domain NS fixes

    Libvirt starts qemu domains in separate Linux namespaces for a while now.
    However, there were still some bugs lingering. For instance libvirt did not
    know how to handle file based bind mounts.
  + Various CPU driver improvements

    There were some minor bugs when using 'host-model' CPU.

# v3.5.0 (2017-07-04)[¶](#v3-5-0-2017-07-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + qemu: Add support for loadparm for a boot device

    Add an optional boot parameter 'loadparm' for a boot device. Loadparm is an
    8 byte parameter that, when present, is queried by S390 guests via sclp or
    diag 308. Linux guests on S390 use it to select a boot entry.
  + Support controlling how video devices are exposed to the bhyve guests

    The vgaconf attribute was added to video 's driver element.
    Possible values are: on , off , and io . It controls the way
    how bhyve exposes video devices to its guests; various guest OSes might
    require different settings to boot properly.
  + qemu: Add support for live updates of coalesce settings

    Users can now use virsh update-device to change the coalesce settings
    of an interfaces while the domain is running.
  + qemu: Allow VirtIO devices to use vIOMMU

    It is now possible to turn on IOTBL for the vIOMMU and have VirtIO devices
    use it, provided they have been configured appropriately.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: block copy job can be used with persistent domains

    Until now it was not possible to use block copy with persistent VMs. In use
    cases where it's not required to recover the job after VM shutdown, it's
    possible to specify VIR\_DOMAIN\_BLOCK\_COPY\_TRANSIENT\_JOB flag to start the
    copy job.
  + JSON pseudo-protocol backing store parser supports new format of qemu 2.9

    QEMU 2.9 modified a few structures corresponding to the JSON format of
    specifying a backing store for a disk image. Libvirt now implements the new
    format.
  + Capabilities now include info about host's CAT settings

    Various information about resource control from the host is gathered and
    presented in capabilities if available.
  + apparmor: Several improvements

    Allow access to Ceph config, EFI firmware on both x86\_64 and aarch64,
    device tree on ppc64 and more.
  + qemu: Support host-model on POWER9 machines
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: snapshot: retrieve image metadata from user provided files

    Disk images of an external snapshot created with
    VIR\_DOMAIN\_SNAPSHOT\_CREATE\_REUSE\_EXT flag specified would not be scanned
    for metadata after recent changes. The metadata is necessary to allow
    keeping relative paths between images when doing a block-commit.
  + Parse decimal numbers in a locale-independent way

    Some locales, such as de\_DE and pt\_BR , use comma rather than dot
    to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a decimal number;
    however, several data sources such as the kernel use a locale-independent
    representation and need to be treated accordingly.
  + Support compilation with newer compiler and libc versions

    Several fixes have been included to make compilation with Clang 4.0.0, GCC
    7.1 and glibc >= 2.25.90 possible.
  + qemu: Query name for vhost-user interfaces at runtime

    This makes it possible to use virsh subcommands such as domiflist
    and domifstat on vhost-user interfaces.
  + qemu: Set MTU for hotplugged interfaces correctly

    When hotplugging a network interface, the MTU was only set on the guest
    side. Set it on the host side as well.
  + qemu: Forbid updating MTU for interfaces of running guests

    The MTU setting can't be modified while the guest is running, so any
    attempt to alter it at runtime will now result in an error rather than
    being silently ignored.
  + qemu: Fix specifying QXL heads with older QEMU releases

    Specifying the number of QXL heads was not working correctly for QEMU
    releases older than 1.6.
  + qemu: Fix migration to older libvirt/QEMU versions

    When the guest is started, libvirt updates the CPU definition to reflect
    the actual CPU features to enforce ABI. We need to send original and
    updated CPU definition in order to support migration to older libvirt/QEMU
    versions. Only the updated CPU definition was sent to destination.

# v3.4.0 (2017-06-02)[¶](#v3-4-0-2017-06-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Improved streams to efficiently transfer sparseness

    New extension to virStream was implemented so that virStorageVolDownload
    and virStorageVolUpload can preserve file sparseness.
  + I/O APIC type can be specified for QEMU/KVM domains

    The ioapic tag was added to domain features , so the type of the
    I/O APIC can now be specified (e.g. putting it in userspace for KVM
    domains).
  + The reason for VM shutdown is reported, if known

    QEMU 2.10 will be able to report the reason for shutting down (whether that
    was caused by the guest or not), and libvirt is prepared for that and
    reports that information in its shutdown event as well, if it is known.
* **Improvements**

  + Repository now has new README.md file

    The new file uses markdown syntax, so it looks better on github and
    possibly other web pages, but it has also more useful information. The old
    README is now symlink to the new file.
  + qemu: Use GICv2 by default for aarch64/virt TCG guests

    The emulated GICv3 has some limitations that make it unusable as a default;
    use GICv2 until they're sorted out. This change makes it once again
    possible to run aarch64/virt guests on a x86\_64 host without having to
    tweak their configuration.
  + Additional capabilities for the node\_device module

    Introduce two new capabilities to the node\_device module. The first is for
    CCW devices, most common on the S390 architecture. The second is for fibre
    channel-backed SCSI devices and exposes the fc\_remote\_port sub-capability
    to SCSI target devices.
  + Node devices now report Mediated device capabilities

    Endpoint devices support new mdev capability and their parents now
    report the supported types in new mdev\_types capability.
  + Capabilities now report information about host caches

    If supported in the kernel, host capabilities will now list L3 caches. The
    code for other levels was added as well, but only L3 caches are reported
    currently.
  + POWER9 CPU model was added

    It is now properly reported in host capabilities.
  + libxl: NUMA sibling distances are now reported in host capabilities
  + VMDK version 3 files are now properly detected
  + Interrupt remapping and Extended interrupt mode for IOMMU devices

    These two new features can now be controlled with new <driver intremap='on/off' eim='on/off'/> tag for iommu devices.
  + Graphics in libxl domains now have default addresses

    Even though there were default addresses before this change, they were not
    saved in the XML. It is now possible to see and control the listen
    addresses properly.
  + Default USB controllers are now added for devices in libxl domains

    Even though they were added automatically when USB device was attached,
    they could've been missing in some other cases. The logic is now fixed so
    there are always USB controllers, even if there was none of them in the
    specified XML.
  + Limits for RPC messages were increased

    Hitting the RPC limits we have is easier every day, so they were increased
    once again and some guessing logic was improved as well. It is now possible
    to get more stats than ever using the virConnectGetAllDomainStats()
    call and push through even bigger requests and replies for all APIs.
* **Bug fixes**

  + qemu: Create memory\_backing\_dir on startup

    Libvirt's policy is that directories are created on startup if they don't
    exist. We've missed this one.
  + PCIe 4.0 cards now report proper link speeds

    It could happen that the link speed for PCIe devices was not properly
    reported or the nodedev-dumpxml just failed. That was due to mistake in the
    field width, but should now work properly.
  + qemu: Do not report errors on shutdown

    For some users, in some rare cases, it could happen that there was an error
    message "internal error: End of file from qemu monitor" in the logs even
    though no problem happened. The detection of these false positives was
    improved and such errors should not show any more.
  + User-specified UNIX socket paths for virtio channels should not be reset

    It could happen, in some cases, that libvirt would mistake a user-specified
    path for its own generated one and thus remove it from the XML. The
    detection of such addresses was improved now.
  + Fix address reservation during RNG hot-plug

    When error occurred in a specific point in time during the hot-plug of an
    RNG device, it could happen that an address was released even though
    another device was already using it, making it possible to hot-plug another
    device with that address, effectively having duplicated addresses in the
    XML.

# v3.3.0 (2017-05-05)[¶](#v3-3-0-2017-05-05 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + net: Add support for coalesce settings

    Enabling data batching through these settings can improve network
    performance for guests.
  + qemu: Add support for guest CPU cache specification

    This features allows fine-grained control of the cache behavior of the
    guest CPU.
  + qemu: Add support for the qemu-xhci USB controller
* **Improvements**

  + hyperv: Support Hyper-V 2012 and newer

    Starting with Hyper-V 2012 the API has changed causing the existing driver
    to be unable to send and process requests properly. This has been resolved
    by adding abstractions to handle the differences and ease handling such
    breaks if they happen in the future.
  + libxl: Add support for nested HVM domains

    Xen has supported nested HVM domains since version 4.4. The libvirt libxl
    driver now supports nested HVM domains by specifying the host-passthrough
    CPU mode when defining a domain.
  + qemu: Implement ACPI support for aarch64 guests

    Up until this point, ACPI support was only advertised for x86\_64 guests and
    disabling it for aarch64 guests was not possible at all.
  + vz: Add support for changing the number of vCPUs
  + qemu: Automatically choose the best USB controller for guests

    The recently introduced qemu-xhci USB controller is the best choice for
    both ppc64 and aarch64 guests, so use it by default on those architectures
    if available.
  + daemon: Increase default task limit for libvirtd

    The default number of tasks for the pids cgroup controller is 512, which
    libvirtd can quickly bump into when starting lots of guests. Raise the
    limit to a more reasonable 32768.
  + docs: Include man pages describing key code names and values
  + virsh: Report initialization errors

    Sometimes virsh might be unable to start: when that happens, report useful
    diagnostics instead of failing silently.
* **Bug fixes**

  + nss: Don't require a network restart for libvirt\_guest

    Previously, the libvirt\_guest NSS module would only work properly after the
    corresponding network had been restarted; now newly started guests will be
    reported correctly right away.
  + storage: Remove unavailable transient pools after restart

    Solve an issue where transient storage pools would be stuck in an
    unmanageable state if the source disappeared and libvirtd was subsequently
    restarted.
  + storage: Fix capacity value for LUKS encrypted volumes

    The 'capacity' value (e.g. guest logical size) for a LUKS volume is smaller
    than the 'physical' value of the file in the file system, so we need to
    account for that.
  + qemu: Fix regression when hyperv/vendor\_id feature is used

    Guests using the feature would not be started at all; it is now possible to
    start them as expected.
  + qemu: Do not crash on USB address with no port and invalid bus
  + crypto: Always pad data before encrypting it

    If this step is not performed, when the data length matches the chunk size
    the decryption routines will misinterpret the last byte of data as the
    padding length and fail to decode it correctly.

# v3.2.0 (2017-04-02)[¶](#v3-2-0-2017-04-02 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + The virt-host-validate tool now supports bhyve hypervisor
  + Introduce NVDIMM memory model

    NVDIMM is new type of memory introduced into QEMU 2.6. The idea is that we
    have a non-volatile memory module that keeps the data persistent across
    domain reboots and offers much faster data accesses. However, due to a bug
    in QEMU, this feature is not enabled for QEMUs older than 2.9.0.
  + qemu: Introduce support for generic PCIe Root Ports

    For new controllers, a generic device (pcie-root-port) will be used by
    default instead of the Intel-specific device (ioh3420), provided the QEMU
    binary supports it.
  + qemu: Add support for checking guest CPU ABI compatibility

    When migrating a domain to a different host, restoring a domain from a file
    or reverting a snapshot libvirt will make sure the guest CPU QEMU presents
    to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on the source host (or
    before the domain's state was saved). This enhanced check may also be
    requested when starting a new domain to ensure the virtual CPU exactly
    matches the one specified in the XML.
  + qemu: Add support to migrate using TLS

    Add the ability to migrate QEMU guests using TLS via a new flag
    VIR\_MIGRATE\_TLS or virsh migrate '--tls' option. Requires using at least
    QEMU 2.9.0 in order to work properly.
  + qemu: add mediated devices framework support

    Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so provide
    an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by introducing a
    new host device type in the XML.
  + qemu: Add support for setting TSC frequency

    Setting TSC frequency is required to enable migration for domains with
    'invtsc' CPU feature turned on.
  + Add support for block device threshold event

    When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the disk in
    certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage this version
    introduces an event which will be fired when a given offset of the storage
    is written by the hypervisor. Together with the API it allows registering
    thresholds for given storage backing volumes and this event will then
    notify management if the threshold is exceeded. Currently only the qemu
    driver supports this.
  + bhyve: Add support for UEFI boot ROM, VNC, and USB tablet

    The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM, so
    non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without using an
    external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also supported now, allowing
    to connect to guests via VNC and use an USB tablet as an input device.
    Please refer to the driver page for domain XML examples.
* **Improvements**

  + qemu: Detect host CPU model by asking QEMU on x86\_64

    Previously, libvirt detected the host CPU model using CPUID instruction,
    which caused libvirt to detect a lot of CPU features that are not supported
    by QEMU/KVM. Asking QEMU makes sure we don't start it with unsupported
    features.
  + perf: Add more perf statistics

    Add support to get the count of cpu clock time, task clock time, page
    faults, context switches, cpu migrations, minor page faults, major page
    faults, alignment faults, emulation faults by applications running on the
    platform.
  + Write hyperv crash information into vm log

    qemu's implementation of the hyperv panic notifier now reports information
    about the crash from the guest os. Starting with this version, libvirt logs
    the information to the vm log file for possible debugging.
* **Bug fixes**

  + QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor

    When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor socket
    which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30 second timeout
    after which the qemu process was killed. This approach is suboptimal as in
    some scenarios with huge amounts of guest RAM it can take a minute or more
    for kernel to allocate and zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now
    flexible and computed by libvirt at domain startup.
  + Overwrite (clear) 2 KB instead of just 512 bytes when initializing logical
    device
  + Describe the logical backend requirements better for pool-create-as

# v3.1.0 (2017-03-03)[¶](#v3-1-0-2017-03-03 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + storage: Add Virtuozzo storage backend storage pool

    Add new storage backend to support pool and volume management within the
    Virtuozzo Storage environment. Virtuozzo Storage is a highly available
    distributed software defined storage with built-in replication and disaster
    recovery.
  + qemu: Add support for memory backing with file source

    Add support in numa topology for file source inside memory backing
    (hugepages are not needed) Three new elements <source/>,<access/> and
    <allocation/> were added to <memoryBacking/> element. Also new
    configuration parameter memory\_backing\_dir was added to qemu.conf.
  + network: make openvswitch call timeout configurable

    Adding the ability to specify the timeout value in seconds for openvswitch
    calls in the libvirtd configuration file.
  + bhyve: add e1000 NIC support

    Add support for e1000 NIC. Previously, the only available option was
    virtio-net .
  + libxl: add tunneled migration support

    Add tunneled migration to libxl driver, which is always capable of strong
    encryption and doesn't require any extra network connection other than
    what's required for remote access of libvirtd.
  + qemu: add rendernode argument

    Add a new attribute 'rendernode' to <gl> spice element.
  + nodedev: add drm capability

    Add a new 'drm' capability for Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) devices,
    providing device type information.
  + Add API for individual/specific vCPU hotplug

    The new API allows selecting specific vCPUs to be added/removed from the
    VM. The existing APIs allowed only adding/removing from the end which did
    not play well with NUMA.
* **Improvements**

  + virsh: pool-list: allow both --uuid and --name in one command

    Adjust the virsh-pool command to support the --uuid and/or --name options
    in order to print just the --name and/or --uuid of pools.
  + Introduce MTU to domain <interface/> and <network>

    Allow setting MTU size for some types of domain interface and network.
  + libxl: improve support for <timer> configurations

    Add support for multiple timers. Extend the tsc timer to support the
    emulate mode. Improve conversion of timer XML to/from xl.cfg.
  + storage: modularize the storage driver

    Split up the storage driver backends into loadable modules so that binary
    distributions don't have to compromise on shipping the storage driver with
    all backends which may pull in too many dependencies.
* **Bug fixes**

  + nodedev: Fabric name must not be required for fc\_host capability

    fabric\_name is one of many fc\_host attributes in Linux that is optional and
    left to the low-level driver to decide if it is implemented. For example
    the zfcp device driver does not provide a fabric name for an fcp host. The
    requirement for the existence of a fabric name has been removed by making
    it optional.
  + bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks

    Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks directly
    rather than assigning that to a controller and using SATA addresses for
    disks. It was implemented this way because bhyve has no notion of an
    explicit SATA controller. However, as this doesn't match libvirt's
    understanding of disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow the
    common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers and SATA
    addresses for disks. If you're having issues because of this, it's
    recommended to edit the domain's XML and remove <address type='pci'> from
    the <disk> elements with <target bus='sata'/> and let libvirt regenerate it
    properly.
  + libxl: maximum memory fixes

    Fix reporting of domain maximum memory. Fix setting dom0 maximum memory.
  + libxl: fix disk detach when <driver> not specified
  + libxl: fix dom0 autoballooning with Xen 4.8
  + qemu: Allow empty script path to <interface/>

    Historically, this was always allowed. Unfortunately, due to some rework
    done for 1.3.2 release a bug was dragged in which suddenly stop allowing
    domain with such configuration to start.

# v3.0.0 (2017-01-17)[¶](#v3-0-0-2017-01-17 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + Domain events for metadata content changes

    The domain events framework has a new event ID that can be used to get
    notifications when domain metadata content changes.
  + Event notifications for the secret object

    The secret object now supports event notifications, covering lifcycle
    changes and secret value changes.
  + New localPtr attribute for "ip" element in network XML
  + qemu: Support QEMU group I/O throttling

    Add the capability to allow group I/O throttling via a new domain <disk>
    <iotune> subelement "group\_name" to allow sharing I/O throttling quota
    between multiple drives.
  + nss: Introduce libvirt\_guest

    New libvirt\_guest nss module that translates libvirt guest names into
    IP addresses.
  + daemon: Add support for runtime logging settings adjustment

    Logging-related settings like log outputs and filters can now be adjusted
    during runtime using the admin interface without the necessity of the
    daemon's restart.
  + storage: Add virStorageVolInfoFlags API

    Add the API to support using the VIR\_STORAGE\_VOL\_GET\_PHYSICAL flag in order
    to return the host physical size in bytes of the image container in the
    allocation field of the \_virStorageVolInfo structure. The --physical flag
    has been added to the virsh vol-info command to access the data.
  + libxl: Implement virDomainGetMaxVcpus API
  + storage: Add overwrite flag checking for logical pool

    Add support for the OVERWRITE flags for the logical storage backend
    including checking for existing data on the target volumes when building a
    new logical pool on target volume(s).
  + qemu: Add support for guest CPU configuration on s390(x)
* **Improvements**

  + perf: Add more perf statistics

    Add support to get the count of branch instructions executed, branch
    misses, bus cycles, stalled frontend cpu cycles, stalled backend cpu
    cycles, and ref cpu cycles by applications running on the platform.
  + conf: Display <physical> for volume xml

    Add a display of the <physical> size of a disk volume in the output of the
    volume XML.
  + qemu: Use virtio-pci by default for aarch64 mach-virt guests

    virtio-pci provides several advantages over virtio-mmio, such as the
    ability to hotplug devices and improved performance. While opting in to
    virtio-pci has been possible for a while, newly-defined guests will now use
    it automatically.
  + vbox: remove support for VirtualBox 3.x and older

    Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by upstream for a long
    time and the API of 4.0 and newer has diverged enough to require code
    abstractions to handle differences. Removing support for those old versions
    drops lots of code from the driver and simplifies the logic to ease
    implementation of new features going forward.
  + virsh: pool-info: introduce option --bytes

    Add option --bytes to virsh pool-info in order ti allow display of units in
    bytes rather than default of human readable output.
  + scsi: Add parent wwnn/wwpn or fabric capability for createVport

    Improve the algorithm searching for the parent scsi\_host device for
    vHBA/NPIV scsi\_host creation. Rather than supplying the "parent" by name,
    it's now possible to define the parent by it's wwnn/wwpn or fabric\_wwn in
    the node device create XML or the storage pool XML.
  + qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot

    When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to provide a place to
    connect PCI Express endpoint devices, libvirt now aggregates multiple root
    ports together onto the same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve
    slots. Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200 endpoint
    devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring setup of any PCIe
    switches.
* **Bug fixes**

  + lxc: fix accidental killing of containers during libvirtd restart

    The libvirt\_lxc process was previously not moved into the container scope.
    As a result, if systemd reloads its config after a container is started,
    when libvirtd is later restarted it will accidentally kill the containers.
  + qemu: Correct GetBlockInfo values

    For an active domain, correct the physical value provided for a raw sparse
    file backed storage and the allocation value provided for a qcow2 file
    backed storage that hasn't yet been opened on the domain.
  + qemu: Make virtio console usable on ppc64 guests

    The chardev detection code has been improved and can now handle this
    configuration properly.
  + qemu: Enable mount namespace

    To avoid funny races with udev relabelling devices under our hands and to
    enhance security, libvirt now spawns each qemu process with its own
    /dev .
  + storage: Fix implementation of no-overwrite for file system backend

    Fix file system storage backend implementation of the OVERWRITE flags to be
    consistent between code and documentation. Add checks to ensure that when
    building a new file system on a target volume that there is not something
    already on the disk in a format that libvirt can recognize.
  + qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis

    Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
    hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels on it.
    With this release, however, each domain is put into a separate path which
    is also correctly labeled.
  + conf: Reject domains with duplicate drive addresses

    Reject duplicate drive addresses for disks and hostdevs at domain
    definition.
  + libxl: reverse defaults on HVM net device attach

    Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is specified.
    Emulated hotplug isn't yet supported and hence we should default to the
    general working scenario.
  + libxl: always enable pae for x86\_64 HVM

    By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit <pae/> setting in
    the domain <features> configuration, an x86\_64 HVM domain would be get an
    i686 environment. pae should always be enabled for x86\_64 HVM domains.
  + qemu: Fix XML dump of autogenerated websocket

    As a result autogenerated websocket port is regenerated on domain restore,
    migration and such as it should be.

# v2.5.0 (2016-12-04)[¶](#v2-5-0-2016-12-04 "Link to this headline")

* **New features**

  + shmem: Add support for additional models

    The shmem device can now utilize QEMU's ivshmem-plain and ivshmem-doorbell,
    more modern versions of ivshmem.
  + vbox: Add VirtualBox 5.1 support
  + libssh: New transport

    The new libssh transport allows one to connect to a running libvirtd via
    SSH, using the libssh library; for example: qemu+libssh://server/system
    .
  + vhost-scsi: Add support scsi\_host hostdev passthrough

    Add the capability to pass through a scsi\_host HBA and the associated LUNs
    to the guest.
  + Allow debugging of gluster volumes in qemu

    Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster volumes in qemu using
    the "gluster\_debug\_level" option in qemu.conf
  + Pre-allocate memory slots for memory hotplug

    Slot numbers for memory devices are now automatically allocated and thus
    persistent. In addition slot numbers can be specified without providing a
    base address, which simplifies user configuration
  + qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default

    For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus (e.g. x86\_64/Q35 and
    aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI device that is an Express device (all
    virtio-1.0 devices, e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed
    on an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a legacy PCI
    controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports added as needed.
* **Improvements**

  + docs: Better documentation for migration APIs and flags
  + vbox: Address thread safety issues
  + virsh: Add support for passing an alternative persistent XML to migrate
    command
  + vhostuser: Allow hotplug of multiqueue devices
  + NEWS: Switch to an improved format

    List user-visible changes instead of single commits for a better high-level
    overview of differences between libvirt releases.
  + website: Modernize layout and branding

    The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now been
    completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better organized and
    more pleasant to look at.
* **Bug fixes**

  + vz: Fix migration in P2P mode
  + Forbid newline character in names of some libvirt objects
  + Fix compilation on macOS

# Libvirt Security Notice: LSN-2014-0003

## Unsafe parsing of XML documents allows arbitrary file read

* CVE-2014-0179

### Description

When parsing XML documents, libvirt passes the XML\_PARSE\_NOENT
flag to libxml2 which instructs it to expand all entities in the XML
document during parsing. This can be used to insert the contents of host
OS files in the resulting parsed content. Although the flaw was introduced
in 0.0.5, it was dormant having no ill effects, since the APIs involved
all required the user to authenticate with privileges equivalent to root.
In version 0.7.5 or later the virConnectCompareCPU / virConnectBaselineCPU
methods activate the dormant bug, allowing for denial of service. In version
1.0.0 or later, if the admin opts in to using the new fine grained access
control feature, there is potential for unprivileged information disclosure.

### Impact

A malicious user can pass libvirt an XML document which contains
an entity that points to an arbitrary file on the host. When libvirt parses
this document, it will insert the contents of that host file, which could
allow the user to read the contents of files that they otherwise do not
have permission to view. It also has the potential to cause a denial of
service / indefinite hang of libvirt, if the entity points to a named
pipe with no writer connected or certain proc files.
If the libvirt installation is not using fine grained access control then
virConnectCompareCPU and virConnectBaselineCPU APIs can be used by a
read-only user to inflict a denial of service attack.
If the libvirt installation is using fine grained access control, then
as well as the denial of service attack, one or more of the following
APIs can be used for information disclosure of files: virDomainDefineXML,
virNetworkCreateXML, virNetworkDefineXML, virStoragePoolCreateXML,
virStoragePoolDefineXML, virStorageVolCreateXML, virDomainCreateXML,
virNodeDeviceCreateXML, virInterfaceDefineXML,
virStorageVolCreateXMLFrom, virConnectDomainXMLFromNative,
virConnectDomainXMLToNative, virSecretDefineXML, virNWFilterDefineXML,
virDomainSnapshotCreateXML, virDomainSaveImageDefineXML,
virDomainCreateXMLWithFiles, virConnectCompareCPU, virConnectBaselineCPU.

### Workaround

Stop use of the fine grained access control mechanism, and
restrict access to all the libvirt TCP/UNIX sockets to only trusted
authenticated users. Simply denying access to the affected APIs in
the access control policy is insufficient to mitigate the bug, since
the XML document typically needs to be parsed before the access
control check is applied in order to extra the UUID/name of the
object to check. Access to the readonly libvirt socket must also
be revoked

## Topic

Updated libvirt packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized
systems.

It was found that libvirt passes the XML\_PARSE\_NOENT flag when parsing XML
documents using the libxml2 library, in which case all XML entities in the
parsed documents are expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse an
XML document with an entity pointing to a special file that blocks on read
access could use this flaw to cause libvirtd to hang indefinitely,
resulting in a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-0179)

Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Libvirt project for reporting this
issue. Upstream acknowledges Daniel P. Berrange and Richard Jones as the
original reporters.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* When hot unplugging a virtual CPU (vCPU), libvirt kept a pointer to

already freed memory if the vCPU was pinned to a host CPU. Consequently,
when reading the CPU pinning information, libvirt terminated unexpectedly
due to an attempt to access this memory. This update ensures that libvirt
releases the pointer to the previously allocated memory when a vCPU is
being hot unplugged, and it no longer crashes in this situation.
(BZ#1091206)

* Previously, libvirt passed an incorrect argument to the "tc" command when

setting quality of service (QoS) on a network interface controller (NIC).
As a consequence, QoS was applied only to IP traffic. With this update,
libvirt constructs the "tc" command correctly so that QoS is applied to all
traffic as expected. (BZ#1096806)

* When using the sanlock daemon for managing access to shared storage,

libvirt expected all QEMU domains to be registered with sanlock. However,
if a QEMU domain was started prior to enabling sanlock, the domain was not
registered with sanlock. Consequently, migration of a virtual machine (VM)
from such a QEMU domain failed with a libvirt error. With this update,
libvirt verifies whether a QEMU domain process is registered with sanlock
before it starts working with the domain, ensuring that migration of
virtual machines works as expected. (BZ#1097227)

All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2366-1: libvirt vulnerabilities

30 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in libvirt.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libvirt](/security/cves?package=libvirt) - Libvirt virtualization toolkit

## Details

Daniel P. Berrange and Richard Jones discovered that libvirt incorrectly

handled XML documents containing XML external entity declarations. An

attacker could use this issue to cause libvirtd to crash, resulting in a

denial of service on all affected releases, or possibly read arbitrary

files if fine grained access control was enabled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-0179](/security/CVE-2014-0179), [CVE-2014-5177](/security/CVE-2014-5177))

Luyao Huang discovered that libvirt incorrectly handled certain blkiotune

queries. An attacker could use this issue to cause libvirtd to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04

LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3633](/security/CVE-2014-3633))
