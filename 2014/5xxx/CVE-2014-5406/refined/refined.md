- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LifeCare PCA Infusion pump does not sufficiently verify the authenticity of data, allowing unauthorized sources to upload drug libraries, software updates, and configuration changes to the pump.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely modify the LifeCare PCA Infusion pump's medication libraries and pump configurations. This could lead to the pump delivering incorrect dosages or malfunctioning, potentially harming patients.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through various ports: Port 23/TELNET, Port 80/HTTP, Port 443/HTTPS, and Port 5000/UPNP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need network access to the affected device and would need a high skill level to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
