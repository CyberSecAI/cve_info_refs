- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Nordex Control 2 (NC2) Wind Farm Portal does not validate the “username” parameter upon submission to the login script, allowing a reflected cross-site scripting attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the user’s browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server. This can potentially lead to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through a crafted URL with malicious script code injected into the "username" parameter, which is then reflected back to the user's browser when the login page is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, and a low skill level is sufficient for exploitation. Publicly available exploits exist.
