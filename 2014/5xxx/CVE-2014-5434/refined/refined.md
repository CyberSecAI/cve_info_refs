    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-5434",
      "root_cause": "The WBM (Wireless Battery Module) has a default account with hard-coded credentials used with the FTP protocol.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of Hard-coded Password"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially gain access to the WBM using the hardcoded credentials. However, the vendor asserts no files can be transferred to or from the WBM using this account, limiting the impact to information disclosure (e.g., possibly device settings).",

        "Remote access via FTP protocol."
