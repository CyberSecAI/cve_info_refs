Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5001:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Ruby gem `kcapifony` version 2.1.6 exposes database passwords by including them directly in command-line executions. Specifically, the gem uses string interpolation (`#{config['pass']}`) to insert the password into `mysqldump`, `pg_dump`, `mysql`, and `psql` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Password Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of database passwords within the process table. When commands like `mysqldump`, `pg_dump`, `mysql`, and `psql` are executed, the password is included as a command-line argument. This exposes the password to local users who have the ability to view running processes via tools like `ps`.
*   **Command Injection (Potential):** The gem uses string interpolation to insert `config['user']` and `config['pass']` into shell commands, this could lead to command injection if these config values are attacker-controlled and contain shell meta characters like `;` and `&`
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The code uses string interpolation, which does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing to the command line, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** An attacker who has the ability to view the process table can steal the database passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Command Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious shell commands through the user and/or password config values, potentially leading to privilege escalation or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Process Monitoring:** A local user with access to system process information can view the command-line arguments and extract the database password.
*   **Remote Command Injection (Potential):** If the gem is used in a context (e.g. a Rails app) where the user/password configs are controllable by an attacker, then remote command injection is possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to monitor running processes.
*   **Remote Control (Potential):** The attacker must be able to influence the value of `config['user']` and `config['pass']` if they are attempting remote command injection.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects lines 482, 484, 522, and 524 of the `ksymfony1.rb` file in the `kcapifony-2.1.6` gem.
*   The gem is used within the context of a Ruby on Rails application.
* The issue was found by Larry W. Cashdollar.
