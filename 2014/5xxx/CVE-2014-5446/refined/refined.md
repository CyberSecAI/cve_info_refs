Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in the `DisplayChartPDF` servlet within ManageEngine NetFlow Analyzer and IT360. Specifically, the `filename` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to download arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows attackers to use "../" sequences in the filename parameter to navigate outside of the intended directory and access sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download sensitive files, including configuration files, system files (like `/etc/passwd` or `boot.ini`), potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable servlet.
*   **Filename Parameter Manipulation:** The `filename` parameter in the `DisplayChartPDF` servlet is the attack vector, using "../" sequences for traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ManageEngine NetFlow Analyzer or IT360 server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access (NetFlow Analyzer):** In the case of NetFlow Analyzer, this vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.
*   **Authenticated Access (IT360):**  In IT360, the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable URL path is: `/netflow/servlet/DisplayChartPDF`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `filename`.
*   An example of exploitation is given: `GET /netflow/servlet/DisplayChartPDF?filename=../../../../boot.ini`
