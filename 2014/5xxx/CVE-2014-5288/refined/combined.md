# Exploit Title: Kemp Load Master - Multiple Vulnerabilities (RCE, CSRF, XSS, DoS)
# Date: 01 April 2015
# Author: Roberto Suggi Liverani
# Software Link: http://kemptechnologies.com/load-balancer/
# Version: 7.1.16 and previous versions
# Tested on: Kemp Load Master 7.1-16
# CVE : CVE-2014-5287/5288

Link: http://blog.malerisch.net/2015/04/playing-with-kemp-load-master.html

Kemp virtual load master is a virtual load-balancer appliance which comes with a web administrative interface. I had a chance to test it and this blog post summarises some of the most interesting vulnerabilities I have discovered and which have not been published yet. For those of you who want to try it as well, you can get a free trial version here: http://kemptechnologies.com/server-load-balancing-appliances/virtual-loadbalancer/vlm-download

By default, Kemp web administrative interface is protected by Basic authentication, so the vulnerabilities discussed in the post below can either be exploited attacking an authenticated user via CSRF or XSS based attacks.

The following vulnerabilities were discovered when looking at Kemp Load Master v.7.1-16 and some of them should be fixed in the latest version (7.1-20b or later).

Change logs of the fixed issues can be found at the following page:

"PD-2183 Functions have been added to sanitize input in the WUI in order to resolve some security issues – fix for CVE-2014-5287 and CVE-2014-5288".

Remote Code Execution - status: fixed in 7.1.20b (reported in June 2014) - CVE-2014-5287/5288

An interesting remote code execution vector can be found through the attack payload below:

http://x.x.x.x/progs/fwaccess/add/1|command

The web application functionality is based on multiple bash scripts contained in the /usr/wui/progs folder. The application is using CGI so that the scripts can handle HTTP requests.

We notice that if the result of the command on line 285 is not positive (check on 286), then seterrmsg function is called.

On line 318 we see a dangerous "eval" against our parameters. By simply attempting multiple characters, the seterrmsg function is invoked and returns plenty of interesting information:

http://x.x.x.x/progs/fwaccess/add/1'ls

Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 27 Dec 2014 23:25:55 GMT
Server: mini-http/1.0 (unix)
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
/usr/wui/progs/util.sh: eval: line 318: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
/usr/wui/progs/util.sh: eval: line 319: syntax error: unexpected end of file

line 318 contains an eval against the $@ (which contains our arguments). The arguments are passed via the fwaccess page, where IFS is set with a slash "/" separator.

By attempting the request below, it is possible to achieve code execution:

http://x.x.x.x/progs/fwaccess/add/1|ls

Response:

Line 120 and line 190 reports an integer expression expected error, as our argument is "1|ls" is obviously no longer an integer. However, the command execution works fine, as we are redirecting output through the pipe character and to "ls" command.

The application is flawed in so many other points, also, via HTTP POST requests

Other injection points that were found:

Page: /progs/geoctrl/doadd
Method: POST
Parameter: fqdn

Page: /progs/networks/hostname
Method: POST
Parameter: host

Page: /progs/networks/servadd
Method: POST
Parameter: addr

Page: /progs/useradmin/setopts
Method: POST
Parameter: xuser

So how can we exploit all this goodness?

CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) - status: not fixed - reported in June 2014

We can use another vulnerability, such as CSRF - most of the pages of the administrative are vulnerable to this attack, so even though a user is authenticated via Basic authentication, the forged request will force the browser to pass the credentials within the HTTP request.

Interestingly enough, there are some kind of protections against CSRF for critical functions, such as factory reset, shutdown and reset. However, they are flawed as well, as the "magic" token matches with the unix epoch timestamp, so it is predictable and can be passed within the request.

Reflected and Stored XSS - status: partially fixed - reported on June 2014

Another way to attack users is via XSS - in this case, we have plenty of options, as both reflected and stored XSS are there. For instance, a user might want to CSRF -> Store XSS -> BeEF just to achieve persistence.

Reflected XSS was found on this point:

Page: /progs/useradmin/setopts
Method: POST
Parameter: xuser

Stored XSS was found on the following points:

Page: /progs/geoctrl/doadd
Method: POST
Parameter: fqdn

A further injection points:

Page: /progs/fwaccess/add/0
Method: POST
Parameter: comment

Page: /progs/doconfig/setmotd
Method: POST
Parameter:

BeEF Module

As part of this research, I have developed a BeEF module to take advantage of chaining these vulnerabilities together. It is always sweet to use a XSS as a starting point to perform code execution against an appliance.

The github pull request for the module can be found here: https://github.com/beefproject/beef/pull/1104/files

For this module, I wanted to use the beef.net.forge_request() function, using a POST method, required to exploit the above RCE vector attacks. However, POST method was not usable at moment of writing this module and @antisnatchor was very quick to fix it in this case. So if you want to try it, ensure you have the latest version of BeEF installed.

Extra - bonus

Denial of Service - status: unknown - reported on June 2014

It appears the thc-ssl-dos tool can bring down the Kemp Load Master administrative interface, which is served over SSL. The same goes if a balanced service is using SSL via Kemp Load Master.

Shell-shock - status: unknown - reported in 2015

Obviously, the application is not immune from the infamous shell-shock vulnerability. This was found by my friend Paul Heneghan and then by a user complaining on the vendor's blog (the comment has been removed shortly after).

For those of you who are more curios, the shell-shock vulnerability works perfectly via the User-Agent header, also in version 7.1-18 and possibly on version 7.1-20 as well.

Funny enough, Kemp provides Web Application Firewall protection, but I wonder how they can "prevent" the OWASP Top Ten (as they claim here), if their main product is affected by so many critical vulnerabilities ;-)

If you are keen for an extra-extra bonus, keep reading...

Extra - extra bonus:

No license, no web authentication

However, most of the underlying functionality is still available and "attackable" without need of basic authentication. You can invalidate the license with a CSRF setting time far in the future ;-)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
