The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5587.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This allows the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- MITM attack is conducted by intercepting and potentially modifying the communication between the app and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- They must be capable of intercepting and modifying network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects numerous Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is maintained to track affected applications and their respective status.
- The vulnerability was discovered using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
- The issue was highlighted by the FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar SSL implementation failures.
- A large number of apps (23667 out of 1000462) have failed dynamic testing for this issue.
