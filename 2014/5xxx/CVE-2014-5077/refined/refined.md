{
  "CVE-2014-5077": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.",
    "vulnerability": "NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker can crash the system, causing a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating simultaneous SCTP connections between the same hosts.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target system.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to a flaw in the sctp_assoc_update function within the net/sctp/associola.c file when SCTP authentication is enabled. Specifically, the function does not correctly inherit authentication capabilities during INIT collisions, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference when subsequent chunks are transmitted."
