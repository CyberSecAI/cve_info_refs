How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [The ManageOwnage Series, part XI]: Remote code execution in ServiceDesk, Asset Explorer, Support Center and IT360

---

*From*: Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib () gmail com>

*Date*: Sun, 4 Jan 2015 17:19:10 +0000

---

```
Hi,

This is part 11 of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts, see [1].

This time we have two remote code execution via file upload (and
directory traversal) on several ManageEngine products - Service Desk
Plus, Asset Explorer, Support Center and IT360.

The first vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated
user, but it can be a low privileged guest (which is a default account
present in almost all installations). This vulnerability can be abused
to drop an EAR file in the JBOSS directory which gets deployed
automatically, giving code execution as SYSTEM / root.

The second vulnerability allows you to perform an unauthenticated
upload to anywhere in the file system with SYSTEM / root privileges.
However only text files are handled correctly, as the servlet mangles
binary files.

Given the prevalence of guest / low privileged / default accounts in
these products, the first vulnerability is by far the most
interesting. I've released a Metasploit module which exploits it for
all products. It should hopefully be integrated soon into Metasploit
[2].

The full text of the advisory is below, and a copy can be obtained in
my PoC repo [3].

Regards,
Pedro

#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory
traversal (authenticated)
CVE-2014-5301
Constraints: user login needed, but exploitable with the default low
privilege guest account (u:guest/p:guest)
Affected versions (inclusive): ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v5 to v9.0
v9030; AssetExplorer v4 to v6.1; SupportCenter v5 to v7.9; IT360 v8 to
v10.4

POST /common/FileAttachment.jsp
POST /workorder/Attachment.jsp (older versions < v7 build 7016;
AssetExplorer v4; all SupportCenter versions)

It is possible to abuse a directory traversal vulnerability when
uploading attachments. A Metasploit module that exploits this
vulnerability has been released.
Post data has to be formatted as a multi-part request with an embedded
ear file. Below is the form data for the newer versions:

Content-Type: multipart/form-data;
boundary=---------------------------9313517619947
Content-Length: 1337

-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="module"

../../server/default/deploy
-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="filePath"; filename="whatever.ear"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<...EAR file here...>

-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="att_desc"

-----------------------------9313517619947--

#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload (unauthenticated)
CVE-2014-5302
Constraints: no authentication or any other information needed except
for IT360 (guest account needed); code execution is only possible by
replacing one of the <install_dir>bin/ scripts and waiting for them to
be executed or for a periodic task to run. This is because only text
files can be uploaded as binary files are mangled; and there no JSP
compiler in the $PATH.
Affected versions: ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v7.6 to v9.0 build
9026; AssetExplorer v? to v6.1 build 6106; IT360 v? to v10.4

POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/run.bat%00
POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/backUpData.bat%00
<...text file / script payload here...>

```
> > ```
> > Fix:
> >
> > ```

```
#1 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9031. It is UNFIXED on all
other products. Disclosure to ManageEngine was done on 04/08/2014, so
over 150 days have elapsed. The last communication I received from
them was that "Once we released this fix in ServiceDesk plus, we
eventually take this in other products like AssetExplorer and
SupportCenter."

#2 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9027 and on AssetExplorer
6.1 build 6107. It is UNFIXED for IT360.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```

Someone has asked me how CVE-2014-5302 can be exploited.

There are 3 things you got to have in mind:
1 - send a null byte (%00) after the file name
2 - send the request as mime type application/octet-stream
3 - send only ASCII data in the request body

Unfortunately it's not as trivial as uploading an ASCII webshell to
the web root. Because of the way these applications are packaged, the
JSP compiler is not set automatically in the PATH/classpath. However,
if you are lucky, the JSP compiler already exists in the
PATH/classpath because of some other application.

Therefore in order to exploit this vulnerability you need to come up
with some clever way like overwriting the run.bat file, uploading a
new /etc/shadow, etc. Note that these apps always run as SYSTEM under
Windows, but they may not run as root in Linux - it depends how they
were installed.

Regards,
Pedro
