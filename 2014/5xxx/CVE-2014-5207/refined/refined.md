  "cve": "CVE-2014-5207",
  "description": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's user namespace subsystem regarding the mediation of mount flags. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to bypass mount restrictions, and potentially gain administrative privileges.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's handling of mount flags during remount operations within user namespaces.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper locking of mount flags: MNT_NOSUID, MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOEXEC and atime flags were not correctly locked during remount operations in user namespaces, allowing unprivileged users to change them.",
        "Missing permission checks: Insufficient checks allowed unprivileged users to clear specific mount flags (like nosuid, nodev, noexec, and atime) set by more privileged users during a remount."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user could bypass mount restrictions, potentially gaining administrative privileges. This could also lead to a denial of service by manipulating atime settings, causing performance degradation. The vulnerability could allow a sandbox escape in containerization systems by gaining write access to read-only bind mounts and potentially circumventing restrictions enforced by flags like nodev, nosuid, and noexec.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local. An unprivileged user within a user namespace can use the `mount --bind -o remount,...` command.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create user namespaces and to execute the mount command. The attacker needs access to a read-only bind mount.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability allows for the clearing of MNT_NOSUID, MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOEXEC, and atime flags. Patches introduced `MNT_LOCK_NOSUID`, `MNT_LOCK_NODEV`, `MNT_LOCK_NOEXEC`, and `MNT_LOCK_ATIME` flags to address the issue."
