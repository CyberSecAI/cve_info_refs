##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-2317-1: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

18 August 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

Eric W. Biederman discovered a flaw with the mediation of mount flags in

the Linux kernel's user namespace subsystem. An unprivileged user could

exploit this flaw to by-pass mount restrictions, and potentially gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-5207](/security/CVE-2014-5207))

Kenton Varda discovered a flaw with read-only bind mounds when used with

user namespaces. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain

full write privileges to a mount that should be read only. ([CVE-2014-5206](/security/CVE-2014-5206))

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-34.60~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-34.60~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-34.60~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-34.60~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE Request: ro bind mount bypass using user namespaces

---

*From*: Kenton Varda <kenton () sandstorm io>

*Date*: Tue, 12 Aug 2014 14:48:28 -0700

---

```
Due to a bug in the Linux kernel's implementation of remount, on systems
with unprivileged user namespaces enabled, it is possible for an
unprivileged user to gain write access to any visible read-only bind mount.
It is also possible to bypass flags like nodev, nosuid, and noexec.

This problem affects sandboxing / containerization systems that do not
expose the regular filesystem to the sandboxed process, but do expose a
bind-mounted view of that filesystem using these flags to enforce security.
This bug may enable a sandbox break-out. Sandboxes which have used
seccomp-bpf to disable the "mount" system call or to disable user
namespaces are likely safe.

Eric Biederman has proposed the following patches to fix the problem:

<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git/commit/?h=for-linus&id=a6138db815df5ee542d848318e5dae681590fccd>

# USN-2318-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

18 August 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Eric W. Biederman discovered a flaw with the mediation of mount flags in

the Linux kernel's user namespace subsystem. An unprivileged user could

exploit this flaw to by-pass mount restrictions, and potentially gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-5207](/security/CVE-2014-5207))

Kenton Varda discovered a flaw with read-only bind mounds when used with

user namespaces. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain

full write privileges to a mount that should be read only. ([CVE-2014-5206](/security/CVE-2014-5206))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

mnt: Correct permission checks in do\_remount

```
While invesgiating the issue where in "mount --bind -oremount,ro ..."
would result in later "mount --bind -oremount,rw" succeeding even if
the mount started off locked I realized that there are several
additional mount flags that should be locked and are not.

In particular MNT_NOSUID, MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOEXEC, and the atime
flags in addition to MNT_READONLY should all be locked.  These
flags are all per superblock, can all be changed with MS_BIND,
and should not be changable if set by a more privileged user.

The following additions to the current logic are added in this patch.
- nosuid may not be clearable by a less privileged user.
- nodev  may not be clearable by a less privielged user.
- noexec may not be clearable by a less privileged user.
- atime flags may not be changeable by a less privileged user.

The logic with atime is that always setting atime on access is a
global policy and backup software and auditing software could break if
atime bits are not updated (when they are configured to be updated),
and serious performance degradation could result (DOS attack) if atime
updates happen when they have been explicitly disabled.  Therefore an
unprivileged user should not be able to mess with the atime bits set
by a more privileged user.

The additional restrictions are implemented with the addition of
MNT_LOCK_NOSUID, MNT_LOCK_NODEV, MNT_LOCK_NOEXEC, and MNT_LOCK_ATIME
mnt flags.

Taken together these changes and the fixes for MNT_LOCK_READONLY
should make it safe for an unprivileged user to create a user
namespace and to call "mount --bind -o remount,... ..." without
the danger of mount flags being changed maliciously.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

We are assigning two CVE IDs because the available information is that
there were two discoverers. Even if the discoverer information is
later clarified, there will still be these two CVE IDs.

> Kenton Varda <kenton@...dstorm.io> discovered that by remounting a

Use CVE-2014-5206.
