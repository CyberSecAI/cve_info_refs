The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5549.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation. The applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can allow the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. The impact varies based on what the application is doing, with potential outcomes including credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker intercepts and manipulates network traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device and capable of intercepting network traffic. This often means the attacker is on a shared network, like a public Wi-Fi.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.
- The vulnerability affects numerous Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is provided with a list of affected apps, available fixes, and other details.
- The document suggests workarounds including not using affected apps, and avoiding untrusted networks
- The issue was also highlighted by the FTC settling charges with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar SSL issues.
