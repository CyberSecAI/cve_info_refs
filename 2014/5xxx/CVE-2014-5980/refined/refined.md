{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of SSL/TLS server certificates.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
