# Released nDPI 1.5.1 and ntopng 1.2.1

 Posted September 6, 2014 · [Add Comment](https://www.ntop.org/ndpi/released-ndpi-1-5-1-and-ntopng-1-2-1/#comments)

Today we have released a maintenance version of both nDPI and ntopng that address minor issues present in the previous stable release. In particular for ntopng we have addressed many small security holes identified by security researchers (our thanks go to [Luca Carettoni](https://twitter.com/_ikki)), and thus we encourage you to upgrade when possible; note that for all these attacks you needed a valid ntopng user and password before to perform them, so their danger level is not too high, but still we encourage you too upgrade. Finally this release contains patches and enhancements courtesy of Debian maintainer [Ludovico Cavedon](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cavedon) who has packaged both [ntopng](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/ntopng) and [nDPI](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libndpi-dev) apps for Debian/Ubuntu.

nDPI Changelog

* Added support for SSL client/server certificate export in nDPI flows
* Added missing -lrt and -lnl libraries required when compiling the demo ndpiReader application with PF\_RING..
* json-c is now optional for the demo ndpiReader application.
* Added missing symbols not previously exported by the nDPI shared library.
* Fixes for Mac OSX HomeBrew package.

ntopng Changelog

* Various fixes to prevent security attacks
  + CSRF attacks
  + XSS attacks
  + Local file inclusion now checks paths (globbing) even for authenticated users
  + Added check for CRSF attacks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site\_request\_forgery)
  + Added extra checks for preventing XSS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site\_scripting)
  + Fix for Set-Cookie HttpOnly
  + Added X­Frame­Options: DENY in http headers to prevent clickjacking attacks
  + Specified charset ISO­8859­1 in HTML resposes to avoid attackers to bypass application’s defensive filters
* Fixes for
  + [CVE-2014-5464](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2014-5464) – Steffen Bauch
  + [CVE-2014-4329](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2014-4329) – Madhu Akula
  + CVE-2014-5511, CVE-2014-5512, CVE-2014-5513, CVE-2014-5514, CVE-2014-5515 – Luca Carettoni
* Patches for CentOS 7, Mac OSX HomeBrew, and Debian package.
* Various minor fixes.

# ntopng 1.2.0 - Cross-Site Scripting Injection

#### EDB-ID:

###### 34419

#### CVE:

###### [2014-5464](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5464)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
ntopng 1.2.0 XSS injection using monitored network traffic

ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network
traffic probe and monitor that shows the network usage, similar to what
the popular top Unix command does.

The web-based frontend of the software is vulnerable to injection of
script code via forged HTTP Host: request header lines in monitored
network traffic.

HTTP Host request header lines are extracted using nDPI traffic
classification library and used without sanitization in several places
in the frontend, e.g. the Host overview and specific subpages for each
monitored host.

The injected code might be used to execute javascript and to perform
management actions with the user-rights of the current ntopng user,
which can be used to disable the monitoring function or deletion of
accounts making the monitoring system unusable.

To give a coarse idea of the vulnerability the following python script
can be used on the monitored network, afterwards the victim needs to
browse to the Host overview / Host details in the ntopng frontend.

import httplib

conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("example.com")
headers = {"Host": "<SCRIPT>alert(\"xss\")</SCRIPT>", "Accept":
"text/plain"}
conn.request("GET", "/", None, headers)
r1 = conn.getresponse()
print(r1.status, r1.reason)
data1 = r1.read()

Other users of the nDPI code might be affected as well.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

This issue has been fixed in ntopng 1.2.1, together with other security
bugs <http://www.ntop.org/ndpi/released-ndpi-1-5-1-and-ntopng-1-2-1/>

@Steffen
I am sure that the ntopng maintainer would appreciate an early heads-up
next time.

# ntopng 1.2.0 XSS injection using monitored network traffic

ntopng 1.2.0 XSS injection using monitored network traffic

```
ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network
traffic probe and monitor that shows the network usage, similar to what
the popular top Unix command does.
```

```
The web-based frontend of the software is vulnerable to injection of
script code via forged HTTP Host: request header lines in monitored
network traffic.
```

```
HTTP Host request header lines are extracted using nDPI traffic
classification library and used without sanitization in several places
in the frontend, e.g. the Host overview and specific subpages for each
monitored host.
```

```
The injected code might be used to execute javascript and to perform
management actions with the user-rights of the current ntopng user,
which can be used to disable the monitoring function or deletion of
accounts making the monitoring system unusable.
```

```
To give a coarse idea of the vulnerability the following python script
can be used on the monitored network, afterwards the victim needs to
browse to the Host overview / Host details in the ntopng frontend.
```

import httplib

conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("example.com")

```
headers = {"Host": "<SCRIPT>alert(\"xss\")</SCRIPT>", "Accept":
"text/plain"}
```

conn.request("GET", "/", None, headers)
r1 = conn.getresponse()
print(r1.status, r1.reason)
data1 = r1.read()

Other users of the nDPI code might be affected as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
