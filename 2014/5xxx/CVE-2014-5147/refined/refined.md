- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Xen hypervisor incorrectly asserts that the current guest mode must match the domain address width when handling a trap from a guest on ARM. This assertion is false when a guest takes a trap from a 32-bit userspace running on a 64-bit kernel within a 64-bit domain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect assertion in Xen hypervisor when handling traps from 32-bit userspace in a 64-bit ARM environment. This occurs because Xen doesn't properly account for the possibility of a 32-bit userspace running within a 64-bit guest kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any user in a guest running a 64-bit kernel with a 32-bit process can crash the host, leading to a host-wide denial of service. An unprivileged guest user can trigger this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: A 32-bit process running within a 64-bit guest kernel triggers a trap that Xen incorrectly handles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user within a guest operating system, capable of running a 32-bit process in a 64-bit kernel environment on a 64-bit ARM system.
