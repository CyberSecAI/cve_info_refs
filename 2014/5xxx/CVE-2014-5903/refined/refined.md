    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of the SSL/TLS server certificate chain."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks over a network connection."
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is widespread, affecting many Android applications, and a spreadsheet is maintained with a list of vulnerable applications. The methodology for testing was developed by CERT using CERT Tapioca. The vulnerability has been publicly known since 2012, with increased attention following FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma."
