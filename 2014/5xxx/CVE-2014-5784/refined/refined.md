{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates when establishing SSL/TLS connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's Android device.",
    "additional_notes": "The issue stems from a failure to validate the SSL chain, ensuring the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority. A large number of Android apps were found to be affected by this vulnerability"
