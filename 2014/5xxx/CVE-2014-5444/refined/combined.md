Geary should open a window with the error, certificate information (checksum etc) and the possibility to permanently accept the certificate. There should also be the possibility to remove the permanently accepted certificates.  Related issues: related to geary - 5224: Dovecot (and other open-source servers) work poorly (Fixed) related to geary - 5805: Unacceptable TLS certificate error (Fixed) related to geary - Feature #6634: Specify folder for Sent Mail (Duplicate)    ---- Additional Comments From geary-maint@gnome.bugs 2013-07-11 15:17:00 -0700 ----  ### History  ####  #1  Updated by Christian Dywan over 1 year ago  I'd like to propose to use "gcr-3", the certificate GUI used by Seahorse and GNOME keyring notably, natively built on GTlsCertificate API. I added it to Midori to display certificate details and I'd love to push for a unified UI.  At minimum, Geary should be able to show the certificate if it's unverified. On top of that, a simple way to import a certificate file, would be the most robust option.  ####  #2  Updated by Christian Dywan over 1 year ago    * **File** cert.png added  ####  #3  Updated by Adam Dingle about 1 year ago    * **Target version** set to _0.2_  ####  #4  Updated by Jim Nelson about 1 year ago  It's possible this will introduce new strings.  ####  #5  Updated by Adam Dingle about 1 year ago    * **Target version** deleted (<strike>_0.2_</strike>)  Too late for 0.2, unfortunately. We should look at this for 0.3.  ####  #6  Updated by Jim Nelson about 1 year ago    * **Target version** set to _0.3.0_  Reported downstream at [https://bugs.launchpad.net/geary/+bug/1071289](https://bugs.launchpad.net/geary/%2Bbug/1071289)  ####  #7  Updated by Chris Lee 11 months ago  Until this is fixed in geary, how do I work around it? There's gotta be some way to download/trust the cert as my user, right?  ####  #8  Updated by Jim Nelson 11 months ago  With the patch for #5805, Geary will accept all certificates and log TLS errors and warnings. This is not the best situation, however, hence we'd like to implement this for 0.3. To get this version of Geary, you'll need to build and install from our git server or use our Daily PPA: [https://launchpad.net/~yorba/+archive/daily-builds/](https://launchpad.net/~yorba/%2Barchive/daily-builds/)  ####  #9  Updated by Jim Nelson 10 months ago    * **Category** set to _client+engine_  ####  #10  Updated by Jim Nelson 10 months ago    * **Tracker** changed from _Bug_ to _Feature_  ####  #11  Updated by Jim Nelson 9 months ago    * **Target version** changed from _0.3.0_ to _0.4.0_  ####  #12  Updated by Jim Nelson 8 months ago  Also ticketed at Launchpad here, but requesting a different aspect of this ticket: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/geary/+bug/1158859](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/geary/%2Bbug/1158859)  ####  #13  Updated by Jim Nelson 4 months ago    * **Target version** changed from _0.4.0_ to _0.5.0_    --- Bug imported by chaz@yorba.org 2013-11-21 20:20 UTC  ---  This bug was previously known as _bug_ 5209 at <http://redmine.yorba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5209> Imported an attachment (id=260631)  Unknown milestone "unknown in product geary.

I'm not exactly sure what the issue is from the above, although it's interesting that your server doesn't support compression.  Can you run Geary like this:  $ geary --debug --log-serializer --log-deserializer > geary.log  and send that to geary@yorba.org?  Note that your username and password will be in this log file.  Please remove before sending them to us, along with any other personal data you don't want to share. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c3)  Olaf Leidinger    2014-01-28 22:40:51 UTC  ``` I just ran this command, configured the mail settings and initiated the serer test via the "add" button (or whatever it is called in the non-locale version). Yet, the log file only contained the following lines - which I consider irrelevant:   [msg] 23:16:23 1,269090 geary-application.vala:167: Geary 0.5.0 prefix=/usr exec_dir=/usr/bin is_installed=true  [deb] 23:16:26 2,909808 null-indicator.vala:13: No messaging menu support in this build  [deb] 23:16:26 0,029253 geary-controller.vala:1153: No accounts found.  [deb] 23:16:26 0,274925 conversation-web-view.vala:179: Loading new message viewer style from /home/oleid/.config/geary/user-message.css...  Enabling auth debug in my dovecot IMAP server didn't reveal anything of importance - the log looks exactly the same as for claws mail. The one and only difference is that geary closes the connection (while the spinner of the GUI is still running).  FYI: I use dovecot 2.2.10 on my gentoo server and geary-git on arch linux (built via PKGBUILD script from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/geary-git/>). Version 0.5.0 from the package manager behaves exactly the same.  Any idea why the log file is (mostly) empty? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c4)  Olaf Leidinger    2014-01-28 23:00:06 UTC  ``` Please ignore the part about the empty log, the rest of the contents where buffered and appeared when closing the app. You'll find a mail in your box. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c5)  Olaf Leidinger    2014-01-28 23:20:45 UTC  ``` Wow... and suddenly things started working. The problem wasn't the IMAP server but the smtp server. It worked if I switched off any encryption. But as I'm not really using the home smtp server for outside mails this is okay. Also, I'm currently not sure if SSL is properly configured for this very server... will check that. I'm sorry for the noise. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c6)  Jim Nelson    2014-01-29 00:01:08 UTC  ``` The dialog box should've said the problem was with your SMTP server and not IMAP, is that the case?  If not, please file a bug about it.  Thanks! ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c7)  Olaf Leidinger    2014-01-29 10:01:48 UTC  ``` It turned out to be a bug in the german translation.  #: ../../src/client/accounts/add-edit-page.vala:634 msgid "        &#8226; SMTP connection error.\n" msgstr "&#8226; IMAP-Verbindungsfehler.\n"  I will report that one. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c8)  Jim Nelson    2014-08-29 00:32:49 UTC  ``` Pushed to master, commit 809128 ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=713247#c9)  Jim Nelson    2014-09-03 00:11:52 UTC  ``` Now available in Geary 0.6.3. ``` |  |
