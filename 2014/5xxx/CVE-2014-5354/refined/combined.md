# USN-2498-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

10 February 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Kerberos.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) - MIT Kerberos Network Authentication Protocol

## Details

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly sent old keys in response to a

-randkey -keepold request. An authenticated remote attacker could use this

issue to forge tickets by leveraging administrative access. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-5351](/security/CVE-2014-5351))

It was discovered that the libgssapi\_krb5 library incorrectly processed

security context handles. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-5352](/security/CVE-2014-5352))

Patrik Kis discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled LDAP queries with

no results. An authenticated remote attacker could use this issue to cause

the KDC to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5353](/security/CVE-2014-5353))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled creating database

entries for a keyless principal when using LDAP. An authenticated remote

attacker could use this issue to cause the KDC to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5354](/security/CVE-2014-5354))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled memory when processing

XDR data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause kadmind to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-9421](/security/CVE-2014-9421))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled two-component server

principals. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform impersonation

attacks. ([CVE-2014-9422](/security/CVE-2014-9422))

It was discovered that the libgssrpc library leaked uninitialized bytes. A

remote attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2014-9423](/security/CVE-2014-9423))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918595#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-19 11:06:16 UTC  ``` In MIT krb5, when a server process uses the krb5_recvauth function, an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL dereference by sending a zero-byte version string, or a read beyond the end of allocated storage by sending a non-null-terminated version string. The example user-to-user server application (uuserver) is similarly vulnerable to a zero-length or non-null-terminated principal name string.  The krb5_recvauth function reads two version strings from the client using krb5_read_message(), which produces a krb5_data structure containing a length and a pointer to an octet sequence.  krb5_recvauth assumes that the data pointer is a valid C string and passes it to strcmp() to verify the versions.  If the client sends an empty octet sequence, the data pointer will be NULL and strcmp() will dereference a NULL pointer, causing the process to crash.  If the client sends a non-null-terminated octet sequence, strcmp() will read beyond the end of the allocated storage, possibly causing the process to crash.  uuserver similarly uses krb5_read_message() to read a client principal name, and then passes it to printf() and krb5_parse_name() without verifying that it is a valid C string.  The krb5_recvauth function is used by kpropd and the Kerberized versions of the BSD rlogin and rsh daemons.  These daemons are usually run out of inetd or in a mode which forks before processing incoming connections, so a process crash will generally not result in a complete denial of service.  Thanks to Tim Uglow for discovering this issue.

Support keyless principals in LDAP [[CVE-2014-5354](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m892-8m95-539h "CVE-2014-5354")]

```
Operations like "kadmin -q 'addprinc -nokey foo'" or
"kadmin -q 'purgekeys -all foo'" result in principal entries with
no keys present, so krb5_encode_krbsecretkey() would just return
NULL, which then got unconditionally dereferenced in
krb5_add_ber_mem_ldap_mod().

Apply some fixes to krb5_encode_krbsecretkey() to handle zero-key
principals better, correct the test for an allocation failure, and
slightly restructure the cleanup handler to be shorter and more
appropriate for the usage.  Once it no longer short-circuits when
n_key_data is zero, it will produce an array of length two with both
entries NULL, which is treated as an empty list by the LDAP library,
the correct behavior for a keyless principal.

However, attributes with empty values are only handled by the LDAP
library for Modify operations, not Add operations (which only get
a sequence of Attribute, with no operation field).  Therefore, only
add an empty krbprincipalkey to the modlist when we will be performing a
Modify, and not when we will be performing an Add, which is conditional
on the (misspelled) create_standalone_prinicipal boolean.

[CVE-2014-5354](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m892-8m95-539h "CVE-2014-5354"):

In MIT krb5, when kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC
database, an authenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL
dereference by inserting into the database a principal entry which
contains no long-term keys.

In order for the LDAP KDC backend to translate a principal entry
from the database abstraction layer into the form expected by the
LDAP schema, the principal's keys are encoded into a
NULL-terminated array of length-value entries to be stored in the
LDAP database.  However, the subroutine which produced this array
did not correctly handle the case where no keys were present,
returning NULL instead of an empty array, and the array was
unconditionally dereferenced while adding to the list of LDAP
operations to perform.

Versions of MIT krb5 prior to 1.12 did not expose a way for
principal entries to have no long-term key material, and
therefore are not vulnerable.
