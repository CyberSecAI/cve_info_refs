Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described for Sphider Search Engine 1.3.6, including CVE-2014-5192, CVE-2014-5193, CVE-2014-5194 and CVE-2014-5082:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (CVE-2014-5192):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the filter option under Sites -> Browser pages.
    *   **Weakness:**  Failure to properly sanitize SQL queries allows for arbitrary SQL injection
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion of database content.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with a crafted `filter` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable admin interface.
2.  **PHP Injection (Likely related to CVE-2014-5193):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization for configuration settings within the application.
    *   **Weakness:** Authenticated users can inject PHP code into the configuration settings.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary PHP code execution leading to full server control. This is dependent on the permissions of the `conf.php` file.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with malicious PHP code in the configuration settings.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  An authenticated user account. The exploit notes that in v1.3.5, authentication can be bypassed.
3. **Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Likely related to CVE-2014-5194 and CVE-2014-5082):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization when handling user supplied values, specifically category names and URLs.
    *   **Weakness:** The application is susceptible to both stored and reflected XSS attacks.
        *   Stored XSS is achieved through injecting javascript in category names.
        *   Reflected XSS is triggered by crafting URLs with javascript.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   Stored XSS: HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with a crafted category name.
        *   Reflected XSS: HTTP POST request to `/sphider/admin/admin.php` with malicious javascript in the `url` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable interfaces.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit details for PHP Injection mention that the installation advises the user to change the permissions of `conf.php` to `chmod 666` which exacerbates the vulnerability.
*   The content provides Proof of Concept (PoC) examples for each vulnerability.
*   The author of the exploits attempted to contact the vendor, but no patch is mentioned.
*   The described vulnerabilities affect Sphider version 1.3.6 and later.
