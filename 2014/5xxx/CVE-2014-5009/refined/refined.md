Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5009:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents confirm that the content is related to CVE-2014-5009. It is described as a command execution vulnerability in the Snoopy library, a component used by Nagios. This CVE is mentioned in multiple sources, including Red Hat security advisories (RHSA-2017:0211, RHSA-2017:0212, RHSA-2017:0213, RHSA-2017:0214), bug reports, and mailing list discussions.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in an incomplete fix for previous command injection vulnerabilities (specifically CVE-2008-4796 and CVE-2014-5008) within the Snoopy library. 
*   The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of user-supplied URLs when using the `curl` command. Specifically, the hostname from a provided URL is extracted for use in the `Host:` HTTP header, without proper escaping.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Due to insufficient sanitization and validation, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the `curl` command line through a crafted URL.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Nagios process.
*   **System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that contains malicious code. This URL is processed by Nagios via the Snoopy library which uses curl internally, and its host component is then passed to the curl command.
*   **HTTP Headers:** The attack is achieved by injecting arbitrary commands into the `Host:` header passed via `-H` flag to the curl command.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send the malicious request to the Nagios service.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication required.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is a result of using `escapeshellarg()` when it was not sufficient. The previous fix for CVE-2014-5008 used `escapeshellarg()` but the extracted host from the URL used in the curl command was not sufficiently escaped.
*   The problem was ultimately resolved by removing the usage of `curl` and using native PHP code to fetch content.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-5009 is a critical command injection vulnerability in the Snoopy library that arises from the incorrect sanitization of user-supplied URLs when used in curl commands by Nagios. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise. The vulnerability exists due to incomplete fixes for previous command execution flaws.
