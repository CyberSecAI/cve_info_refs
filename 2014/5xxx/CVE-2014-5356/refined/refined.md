{
  "CVE-2014-5356": {
    "description": "The OpenStack Image service (glance) does not honor the image_size_cap configuration option. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a denial of service.  The import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).",
    "affected_components": [
      "OpenStack Glance",
       "Red Hat OpenStack Platform",
        "Ubuntu OpenStack"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The image_size_cap configuration option in Glance was not being enforced during image upload via the v2 API.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate enforcement of configuration limits",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can upload an image exceeding the configured size limit to a Glance store and exhaust disk space, leading to a denial of service. This prevents further image uploads and may disrupt services relying on Glance.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user with the ability to upload images to Glance."
