## Known Issues and Limitations

### Neutron

There is a known issue in all Havana releases that results in Neutron DHCP agent constantly resyncing its state once a network and a subnet
is created with a gateway outside of it. To avoid this, users are encouraged to set force\_gateway\_on\_subnet to True in neutron.conf. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1304181](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1304181)

Subject: [OSSA 2014-028] Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion (CVE-2014-5356)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-028
CVE: CVE-2014-5356
Date: August 21, 2014
Title: Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion
Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP), Stuart McLaren (HP)
Products: Glance
Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a
vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance
store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the
image_size_cap configuration option is not honored. This may prevent
further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the
import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are
affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/91764>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/115280>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/115289>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-3 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.3 releases.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1338)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and three
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

It was discovered that the image\_size\_cap configuration option in glance
was not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an
image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Whenever the 'x-image-meta-store' header was passed to glance-api, the

service would check whether the value was a valid store instead of a valid
scheme. However, the rest of the store library uses the scheme to identify
the store that should be used; this prevented the use of this feature.
Glance now verifies that the value of 'x-image-meta-store' is a valid
scheme instead of a valid store name. (BZ#1134249)

* With this update, Image Service (glance) is now dependent on oslo.vmware

in order to support the optional VMware store. This hard dependency was
created due to the likelihood that the dependencies are already installed
and due to the diminutive size of the package. As a result, the user
experience is improved by no longer requiring a manual oslo.vmware
install. (BZ#1125876)

* Previously, the process of upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Linux

OpenStack Platform 4 to 5 may have failed. (BZ#1139243)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 5.0 for RHEL 6 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1125876](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1125876)

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1337)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and two bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

It was discovered that the image\_size\_cap configuration option in glance
was not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an
image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Uploading an image to glance that exceeded the user's current quota

setting was rejected, but no message was added to the glance API log to
indicate this. This update fixes this bug, and such events are now logged
as INFO messages in the glance API log. (BZ#1055550)

* Whenever the 'x-image-meta-store' header was passed to glance-api, the

service would check whether the value was a valid store instead of a valid
scheme. However, the rest of the store library uses the scheme to identify
the store that should be used; this prevented the use of this feature.
Glance now verifies that the value of 'x-image-meta-store' is a valid
scheme instead of a valid store name. (BZ#1130622)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

I'm wondering if there's a security aspect to this?

If it's possible to upload an image of unrestricted length and then create multiple compute instances using that image there is the possibility that the filesystem on the nova compute nodes will fill up, preventing further instances from being created.

Clear DoS, should probably be an OSSA as it's a code defect in OpenStack. OSSN would simply recommend caution around image who you allow to upload images.

How would this allow one to fill up the Nova compute nodes? Wouldn't the instance flavors still control the amount of disk that is used?

I could see this allowing one to fill up the backend storage used by Glance, though user\_storage\_quota should allow one to prevent this. The quota isn't set by default, but that could be recommended in an OSSN. The defaults for these values are as follows:

image\_size\_cap = 1099511627776 (1TB)

  user\_storage\_quota = 0 (unlimited)

If I understand the way these values are intended to work correctly, one would be able to fill up Glance's backend storage by simply adding many images that are under the image\_size\_cap with the default settings. The fact that the cap is broken just means that one could add a lower number of larger images to fill up Glance's storage than they would if the cap was functioning properly.

This vulnerability seems to be introduced in Grizzly at least, and as we don't support grizzly anymore we'll mark every versions up to 2013.2.3 affected.

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion

Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1

Description:

Thomas Leaman from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image\_size\_cap configuration is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Only setups using Glance image service are affected.

Impact description looks fine. A couple of grammatical problems maybe.

e.g. Should 'upload' be 'uploads' in "This may prevent further image upload"?

Thanks Tristan, couple of things:

1) Only the Glance v2 api is affected (v1 is not)

2) I think image 'import' is not affected -- it may be worth explicitly stating this, as import/upload

are similar functionality.

3) Is it possible/appropriate to put my name as well as Thomas's? (If not, no big deal!)

Thanks Tristan. :-)

> All Glance setups using API v2 are affected.

It's possible to restrict/disable image upload using a policy, if you've done that you won't be affected even if you're using v2. Not sure if that's worth mentioning or is too much detail.

### Bug Description

To reproduce (using devstack):

create an image

upload image data larger than image\_size\_cap

This should result in an error, but doesn't

I'm wondering if there's a security aspect to this?

If it's possible to upload an image of unrestricted length and then create multiple compute instances using that image there is the possibility that the filesystem on the nova compute nodes will fill up, preventing further instances from being created.

Clear DoS, should probably be an OSSA as it's a code defect in OpenStack. OSSN would simply recommend caution around image who you allow to upload images.

How would this allow one to fill up the Nova compute nodes? Wouldn't the instance flavors still control the amount of disk that is used?

I could see this allowing one to fill up the backend storage used by Glance, though user\_storage\_quota should allow one to prevent this. The quota isn't set by default, but that could be recommended in an OSSN. The defaults for these values are as follows:

image\_size\_cap = 1099511627776 (1TB)

  user\_storage\_quota = 0 (unlimited)

If I understand the way these values are intended to work correctly, one would be able to fill up Glance's backend storage by simply adding many images that are under the image\_size\_cap with the default settings. The fact that the cap is broken just means that one could add a lower number of larger images to fill up Glance's storage than they would if the cap was functioning properly.

I think this warrants an OSSA, even if the Nova impact is yet unclear.

This vulnerability seems to be introduced in Grizzly at least, and as we don't support grizzly anymore we'll mark every versions up to 2013.2.3 affected.

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion

Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1

Description:

Thomas Leaman from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image\_size\_cap configuration is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Only setups using Glance image service are affected.

Impact description looks fine. A couple of grammatical problems maybe.

e.g. Should 'upload' be 'uploads' in "This may prevent further image upload"?

Thanks Tristan, couple of things:

1) Only the Glance v2 api is affected (v1 is not)

2) I think image 'import' is not affected -- it may be worth explicitly stating this, as import/upload

are similar functionality.

3) Is it possible/appropriate to put my name as well as Thomas's? (If not, no big deal!)

Thanks Tristan. :-)

> All Glance setups using API v2 are affected.

It's possible to restrict/disable image upload using a policy, if you've done that you won't be affected even if you're using v2. Not sure if that's worth mentioning or is too much detail.

Thanks Tristan. :-)

It's possible to restrict/disable image upload using a policy, if you've done that you won't be affected even if you're using v2. Not sure if that's worth mentioning or is too much detail.

configuration -> configuration option

Maybe add "(unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload)" at the end to cover for Stuart's remark

Thanks for the review, it now cover Stuart's comment #12,

Here is impact description draft #3:

Title: Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion

Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP), Stuart McLaren (HP)

Products: Glance

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Description:

Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image\_size\_cap configuration is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).

nitpick: "configuration" -> "configuration option"

Otherwise looks good.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131770#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-20 04:13:40 UTC  ``` The OpenStack project reports:  "" Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the image_size_cap configuration option is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload). ""  This affects versions up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 to 2014.1.2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

However, the rest of the store library uses the scheme to identify the store that should be used. This prevented the use of this feature. This has been fixed so now Glance verifies that the value of 'x-image-meta-store' is a valid scheme instead of a valid store name. | | | Clone Of: | [1130622](show_bug.cgi?id=1130622 "CLOSED ERRATA - Glance `--store` checks on store name instead of scheme") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-09-30 17:15:36 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1685)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

It was discovered that the image\_size\_cap configuration option in glance
was not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an
image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a
denial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1146089)

All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running glance services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1139243#c0)  Lon Hohberger    2014-09-08 13:08:07 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1133905](show_bug.cgi?id=1133905 "CLOSED ERRATA - RHOS4->RHOS5 upgrade fails due to wrong version of python-migrate installed") +++  Dafna was following our upgrade documentation and ran into the following error while trying to upgrade the Cinder database:    Can't determine the existing sync level.   Please ensure the database is running and already initialised.  The actual error from /var/log/cinder/cinder-manage.log, was:    TRACE cinder   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cinder/utils.py", line 423, in __get_backend   TRACE cinder     self.__backend = __import__(name, None, None, fromlist)   TRACE cinder   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cinder/db/sqlalchemy/migration.py", line 21, in <module>   TRACE cinder     from migrate.versioning import api as versioning_api   TRACE cinder   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/migrate/versioning/api.py", line 33, in <module>   TRACE cinder     from migrate.versioning import (repository, schema, version,   TRACE cinder   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/migrate/versioning/schema.py", line 10, in <module>   TRACE cinder     from sqlalchemy import exceptions as sa_exceptions   TRACE cinder ImportError: cannot import name exceptions  This is caused because after upgrading the openstack packages, python-migrate is still at version python-migrate-0.7.1-1.el6ost.noarch, while version python-migrate-0.8.2-2.el6ost.noarch is required.  The workaround is to manually upgrade python-migrate:      yum upgrade python-migrate  The solution is to set a versioned Requires: on all of the openstack packages that require python-migrate.  According to 'repoquery --whatrequires python-migrate', this is:    openstack-heat-common   python-ceilometer   python-cinder   python-glance   python-keystone   python-nova  --- Additional comment from Lars Kellogg-Stedman on 2014-08-26 08:38:16 EDT ---  Using the openstack-cinder spec file as an example, I would probably change:  Requires:         python-sqlalchemy Requires:         python-migrate  To:  Requires:         python-sqlalchemy >= 0.8.4 Requires:         python-migrate >= 0.8.2  --- Additional comment from Lars Kellogg-Stedman on 2014-08-26 13:48:48 EDT ---  Fixed in:  openstack-heat-2014.1.2-2.0.el6ost openstack-ceilometer-2014.1.2-2.el6ost openstack-cinder-2014.1.2-3.el6ost openstack-glance-2014.1.2-3.el6ost openstack-nova-2014.1.2-4.el6ost  This was previously fixed in:  openstack-keystone-2014.1.2.1-2.el6ost   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1139243#c3)  Dafna Ron    2014-09-11 16:29:58 UTC  ``` we do not fail on upgrade and the package exists after upgrade:  [root@RHEL6 ~]# rpm -qa |grep python-sqlalchemy python-sqlalchemy-0.8.4-1.el6ost.x86_64 python-sqlalchemy0.7-0.7.8-1.el6ost.x86_64 [root@RHEL6 ~]# rpm -qa |grep python-migrat python-migrate-0.8.2-2.el6ost.noarch [root@RHEL6 ~]#   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1139243#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-30 17:15:40 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
