      "Improper verification of server certificates during SSL/TLS handshake."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.",
