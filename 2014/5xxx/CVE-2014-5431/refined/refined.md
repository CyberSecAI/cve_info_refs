The provided document from ics-cert.us-cert.gov describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, with one of them being assigned CVE-2014-5431.

**CVE-2014-5431**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Baxter SIGMA Spectrum infusion pumps contain a hard-coded password.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a hard-coded password.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the device could use the hard-coded password to access management functions. This allows for unauthorized configuration changes to biomedical settings, such as turning on/off wireless connections and disabling the audible alarm indicating the end of an infusion phase.
*   **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device.

The document provides additional details about other related CVEs affecting the same product, including:

**CVE-2014-5432**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authentication bypass in the Wireless Battery Module (WBM).
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The WBM is remotely accessible via Port 22/SSH without authentication.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can make unauthorized configuration changes to the WBM, access account credentials, and shared keys.
*   **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the WBM.

**CVE-2014-5433**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cleartext storage of sensitive information in the Wireless Battery Module (WBM).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Wireless account credentials are stored in cleartext on the WBM.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute commands to view wireless account credentials, potentially gaining access to the host network.
*   **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the WBM.

**CVE-2014-5434**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use of hard-coded credentials for the FTP protocol in the Wireless Battery Module (WBM).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The WBM has a default account with hard-coded credentials used with the FTP protocol.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: While Baxter asserts that no files can be transferred to or from the WBM, the vulnerability could potentially allow unauthorized access to the FTP service.
*  **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the WBM.
