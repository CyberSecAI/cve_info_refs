Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The tboot (trusted boot loader) module did not measure all command-line parameters during the boot process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Measurement:** tboot failed to include all command-line parameters in its measurements, which are intended to ensure the integrity of the boot process.
*   **Bypass of Measured Boot:** This incomplete measurement allows an attacker to bypass the measured boot process by manipulating unmeasured command-line parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Measured Boot Chain:** An attacker could potentially circumvent the measured boot process, making it possible to load modified or malicious components while the system would appear to have undergone a secure boot. This could lead to arbitrary code execution and complete compromise of the system.
*   **Pretend Measured Boot:** By using unmeasured parameters, an attacker could pretend to the system that the boot process was measured correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command-line Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by modifying or adding unmeasured command-line parameters during the boot sequence. This can be done via direct access to boot configuration or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify boot process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to modify boot parameters:** An attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the command-line parameters passed to the kernel during boot. This could be through direct physical access to the machine, remote access through other vulnerabilities, or through a compromised boot loader or configuration.
*  **Physical access is not strictly required**: The attacker can modify boot parameters by exploiting an existing vulnerability to modify the boot configuration remotely

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects tboot versions prior to 1.8.2.
*   The fix involves ensuring all command-line parameters are included in the measurement process.
*   The fix is specific to TBOOT Argument Measurement Vulnerability for GRUB2 + ELF Kernels
