Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of sanitation of user-supplied input in multiple parts of the OpenEMR application. This allows for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input sanitization.
*   The vulnerability is present in various parameters across different scripts/pages of the OpenEMR application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful attack could allow an authenticated attacker to access sensitive information stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes.
*   An attacker might be able to manipulate or delete data within the database, potentially causing further disruption.
*   The attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are HTTP GET and POST requests to various scripts, injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters.
*   Specifically, the following parameters were identified as vulnerable:
    *   `layout_id` in `/openemr/interface/super/edit_layout.php`
    *   `form_patient_id`, `form_drug_name`, `form_lot_number` in `/openemr/interface/reports/prescriptions_report.php`
    *   `payment_id` in `/openemr/interface/billing/edit_payment.php`
    *   `id` in `/openemr/interface/forms_admin/forms_admin.php`
    *   `form_pid`, `form_encounter` in `/openemr/interface/billing/sl_eob_search.php`
    *   `sortby` in `/openemr/interface/logview/logview.php`
    *   `form_facility` in `/openemr/interface/orders/procedure_stats.php`
    *   `form_facility` in `/openemr/interface/orders/pending_followup.php`
    *   `form_facility` in `/openemr/interface/orders/pending_orders.php`
	*   `patient`, `encounterid`, `formid`, `issue` in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/deleter.php`
    *   `search_term` in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/encounter/coding_popup.php`
    *   `text` in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/encounter/search_code.php`
	*   `form_addr1`, `form_addr2`, `form_attn`, `form_country`, `form_freeb_type`, `form_partner`, `form_name`, `form_zip`, `form_state`, `form_city`, `form_cms_id` in `/openemr/interface/practice/ins_search.php`
	*   `form_pid` in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/problem_encounter.php`
    *  `patient`, `form_provider`, `form_apptstatus`, `form_facility` in `/openemr/interface/reports/appointments_report.php`
	*   Multiple parameters in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/summary/demographics_save.php`
	*   `p` in `/openemr/interface/fax/fax_dispatch_newpid.php`
	*   `patient_id` in `/openemr/interface/patient_file/reminder/patient_reminders.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenEMR application to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints with the malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information includes a list of vulnerable parameters and example requests showing where SQL injection payloads can be inserted.
*   The identified vulnerable version is 4.1.2(7) and earlier.
*   The issue was reported by Jerzy Kramarz from Portcullis Advisories, with further details available at the provided URL.
*   The advisory also mentions that the issue is not fixed at the time of the report.
