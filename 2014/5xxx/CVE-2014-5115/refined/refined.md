Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-5115

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This occurs because the application, DirPHP version 1.0, does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `phpfile` parameter in the `index.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server. This is due to the lack of input validation on the `phpfile` parameter in `index.php`.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate user input for the `phpfile` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, application code, and other data. As demonstrated in the Proof of Concept, the attacker can read the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user account information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` file.
- **`phpfile` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `phpfile` parameter to include local files they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable DirPHP application.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** While not strictly necessary to exploit the LFI, knowing the file system structure of the target system (e.g., locations of sensitive files) will allow an attacker to access the more valuable information.

**Additional Information:**
- **Vulnerable Application:** DirPHP version 1.0
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** `http://site.com/path/index.php?phpfile=/etc/passwd`
- **Google Dork:** `intext:DirPHP - version 1.0 - Created & Maintained by Stuart Montgomery`
