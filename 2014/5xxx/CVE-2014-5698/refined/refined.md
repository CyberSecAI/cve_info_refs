The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5698.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means they do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation: The applications do not properly check the SSL/TLS certificate chain to confirm the server's identity. This failure to validate the certificate chain can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: Attackers on the same network as the Android device can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing: Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive user credentials transmitted through the compromised connections.
- Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to perform a MITM attack. This can include public Wi-Fi networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the target device to intercept the communication.
- Ability to perform MITM attacks: The attacker needs the technical ability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Android applications.
- The CERT/CC provides a spreadsheet that lists affected applications and their fix status.
- The vulnerability was discovered using dynamic analysis tools, specifically CERT Tapioca.
- The vulnerability was also noted in FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar issues.
- This vulnerability has been known about since at least 2012, but was widely reported around 2014
- The CERT/CC assigned Vulnerability Note VU#582497 to this issue.
