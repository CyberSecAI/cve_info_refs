**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the DNP3 Master Driver (specifically version 3.02 and prior) used in Elipse SCADA, Elipse E3, and Elipse Power systems. The vulnerability is triggered by sending data packets with formatting errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') (CWE-400): The affected software fails to properly handle malformed DNP3 packets, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Exploitation can cause the affected Elipse software (SCADA, E3, Power systems) to become unavailable.
- Temporary unavailability (approximately 30 seconds) for Elipse E3 and Elipse Power systems.
- System unavailability until a manual restart for Elipse SCADA.
- The process to be disabled until it is manually restarted

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- Sending specially crafted DNP3 data packets with formatting errors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low skill level: An attacker with low technical skills can exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send the malformed DNP3 packets to the target system.

**Additional details:**
- Affected products include Elipse SCADA 2.29 build 141 and prior with the DNP3 driver, Elipse E3 versions V1.0 to V4.6, Elipse Power systems Versions V1.0 to V4.6, and DNP 3.0 Master v3.02 and prior.
- A CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) has been assigned to this vulnerability.
- A patch is available in DNP Master Driver (V.4.0.21).
