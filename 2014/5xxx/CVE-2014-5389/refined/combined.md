# Blind SQLi vulnerability in Content Audit could allow a privileged attacker to exfiltrate password hashes (WordPress plugin)

*From*: dxw Security <security () dxw com>

```
Details
================
Software: Content Audit
Version: 1.6
Homepage: <http://wordpress.org/plugins/content-audit/>
Advisory report:
<https://security.dxw.com/advisories/blind-sqli-vulnerability-in-content-audit-could-allow-a-privileged-attacker-to-exfiltrate-password-hashes/>
CVE: CVE-2014-5389
CVSS: 3.6 (Low; AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P)

Description
================
Blind SQLi vulnerability in Content Audit could allow a privileged attacker to exfiltrate password hashes

Vulnerability
================
An attacker with an admin account is able to add arbitrary text in the “Audited content types” option by using a DOM
inspector to modify the value of a checkbox field. This text is then inserted into an SQL query and executed as part of
a daily wp-cron job.
The fact that this is run only once a day makes it rather minor. An attacker would potentially need to poll
/wp-cron.php repeatedly for 24 hours until they got the first result. As blind SQL injection attacks are usually done
by comparing the first character to all possible characters – one at a time, until a match is found – it would take a
very long time to exfiltrate useful data.
However, we don’t discount the possibility that someone cleverer than us could figure out a more practical attack.

Proof of concept
================
Steps an attacker may take:

Visit /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=content-audit
Check an “Audited content types” checkbox
Right-click that checkbox and select “Inspect element”
Set the value attribute of the element to something which does sleep(5) if the first byte of the admin’s password hash
is ‘a’ or sleep(10) otherwise
Press “Update Options”
Poll /wp-cron.php repeatedly until it takes longer than 5 seconds and record how long the request took
Repeat

Steps to take to verify that this issue exists:

Visit /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=content-audit
Check a “Audited content types” checkbox
Right-click that checkbox and select “Inspect element”
Set the value attribute of the element to “‘” (a single apostrophe)
Press “Update Options”
Add “add_action(‘init’, ‘content_audit_mark_outdated’);” to content-audit-schedule.php somewhere and load any page
This error should occur: “WordPress database error You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that
corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘2013-08-12′”
If you replace “$oldposts = $wpdb->get_results” with “echo” on line 134 of content-audit-schedule.php you’ll notice
that it’s inserting the ‘ unescaped – which means that you can insert whatever you like

Mitigations
================
You should update to version 1.62.

# Content Audit

* [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-audit/#reviews)
* [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-audit/#installation)
* [Development](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-audit/#developers)

[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/content-audit/)

## Description

Lets you create a content inventory right in the WordPress Edit screens, similar to the process you might use to assess your site’s content in a spreadsheet. You can mark content as redundant, outdated, trivial, or in need of a review for SEO or style. These content status labels work just like categories, so you can remove the built-in ones and add your own if you like. You can also assign a content owner (distinct from the original author) and keep internal notes. The IDs are revealed on the Edit screens so you can keep track of your content even if you change titles and permalinks. The plugin supports custom post types as well as posts, pages, and media files.

There’s an Overview report under the Dashboard menu that shows you which posts/pages/attachments/etc. need attention, sorted by user. This screen also lets you export a CSV file of the audit report.

The plugin creates three new filters on the Edit screens: author, content owner, and content status. This should make it easy to narrow your focus to just a few pages at a time.

You can display the audit details to logged-in editors on the front end if you want, either above or below the content. You can style the audit message with custom CSS.

**New:** you can now clear data from past audits and start over!

#### Translations

If you would like to send me a translation, please write to me through [my contact page](http://sillybean.net/about/contact/). Let me know which plugin you’ve translated and how you would like to be credited. I will write you back so you can attach the files in your reply.

### Notes

#### Filter reference

‘content\_audit\_notes’ filters the public display of the notes field

‘content\_audit\_dashboard\_get\_posts\_args’ filters the get\_posts() arguments for the Dashboard widget

‘content\_audit\_dashboard\_output’ filters the table output of the Dashboard widget

‘content\_audit\_dashboard\_congrats’ filters the congratulations message of the Dashboard widget

‘content\_audit\_csv\_filename’ filters the file name of the CSV download

‘content\_audit\_csv\_header\_data’ filters the header label array in the CSV download

‘content\_audit\_csv\_row\_data’ filters the contents of each row (as an array) in the CSV download

This is a light-weight plugin that’s very approachable.. I’ve found people like using it.
I could imagine more robust reporting features and other small polishes, but this plugin pretty much does exactly what it says and works great.

Tried this out on my site last week. You can use it to label your posts and pages, then filter them by a criteria. So for example to find: all posts that need rewriting; or all pages that are up-to-date. There are a few additional features, such as emailing you when it’s more than a year since a post was updated.
On the whole, this is a nice and simple, sensible plugin to use, particularly on a website with a lot of content.

* Audit attribute (term) counts are now totaled per post type. Under ‘Pages,’ the Content Audit terms’ page counts show only pages, not the cumulative number of posts across all post types (which is the WordPress default for counting term totals, and is what was shown in older versions). For cumulative totals, see the top of the Overview screen.

#### 1.4.1

* Fixed disappearing columns after Quick Edit.

* New Overview screen (the “boss view”) under Dashboard. Shows counts for each content audit attribute (outdated, trivial, etc.) and lists how many of each content type belong to the various content owners.
* New option to set an expiration date for individual posts/pages/etc., at which time the content will be marked as outdated.
* Supports custom roles.
* Added “audited” status to the default list, to be used when the audit for that item is complete. This can be removed.

#### 1.3.1
