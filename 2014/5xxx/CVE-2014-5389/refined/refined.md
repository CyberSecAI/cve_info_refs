Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "Content Audit" WordPress plugin version 1.6 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when updating the plugin's settings. Specifically, the values of checkboxes for "Audited content types" are not sanitized before being inserted into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:**  Arbitrary SQL code can be injected by modifying the value attribute of a checkbox input field using a DOM inspector. This injected code is then executed as part of a daily `wp-cron` job.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the values submitted in the "Audited content types" form before using them in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data exfiltration:** A successful attacker can use this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive information from the database, such as password hashes, through time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the possibility of arbitrary code execution may exist depending on the database configuration and user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with admin privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin settings page.
- The attacker must be able to modify the HTML of the webpage using a browser's developer tools (DOM inspector) to insert malicious SQL code into the checkbox value attributes.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is considered "low" severity due to the high attack complexity (requires DOM manipulation) and the fact that the malicious code is executed only once a day via `wp-cron`.
- A proof-of-concept is provided to demonstrate how an attacker could use the DOM inspector to inject a `sleep()` command to perform time-based SQL injection attacks.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.2 of the plugin.
- The advisory also notes that while exfiltrating data would be slow, a more efficient attack could potentially be devised.
