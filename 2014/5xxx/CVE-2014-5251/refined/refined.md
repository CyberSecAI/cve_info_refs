{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-5251",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "MySQL database stores timestamps with a seconds accuracy, while the OpenStack Keystone revocation events code expects sub-second accuracy. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the stored expiration time with the actual token expiration time, causing revocation to fail.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent timestamp accuracy between the database and the application logic.",
      "Reliance on exact timestamp matching for revocation."
    ],
    "impact": "Manually revoked tokens remain valid, allowing unauthorized access to resources. Tokens are not revoked when they should be.",
     "attackVectors": [
      "Exploitation requires a user to have a valid token to be revoked.",
      "Vulnerability is triggered when the system is configured to use revocation events, and when a MySQL backend is used."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs a valid, but revoked, token.  An attacker must also be able to access a system that uses the vulnerable keystone configuration.",
      "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability only impacts OpenStack Keystone setups configured to use revocation events and the SQL token driver with MySQL."
  }
