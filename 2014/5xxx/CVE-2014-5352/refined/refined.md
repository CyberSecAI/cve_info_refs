  "CVE-2014-5352": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect memory management in the libgssapi_krb5 library when processing a valid context deletion token using gss_process_context_token().",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Double-free",
      "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker could cause a vulnerable application (including kadmind) to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending crafted GSSAPI traffic, specifically a valid context deletion token to trigger gss_process_context_token() in a vulnerable application, such as kadmind.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated user with the ability to send crafted GSSAPI traffic, or manipulate an application to call gss_process_context_token()"

  "CVE-2014-9421": {
     "Root cause": "Improper handling of invalid External Data Representation (XDR) data by MIT Kerberos kadmind, which may cause use-after-free and double-free memory access violations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Use-after-free",
       "Double-free",
       "Improper input validation"

  "CVE-2014-9422": {
     "Root cause": "MIT Kerberos kadmind incorrectly accepts authentication requests for two-component server principal names due to flawed validation logic that compares length-counted principal name components against null-terminated C strings.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of principal names",
      "Impersonation vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with the key for a specially named principal (e.g., 'kad/x') can impersonate any user to kadmind and perform administrative actions as that user.",
    "Attack vectors": "By authenticating to kadmind with a specially crafted two-component server principal name whose first component is a left substring of 'kadmin' or whose realm is a left prefix of the default realm.",

    "Root cause": "The kadm5_randkey_principal_3 function in lib/kadm5/srv/svr_principal.c in kadmind sent old keys in a response to a -randkey -keepold request.",

    "CVE-2014-5353": {
      "Root cause": "When kadmind is used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a remote, authenticated attacker who has the permissions to set the password policy could crash kadmind by attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a password policy for a principal.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
