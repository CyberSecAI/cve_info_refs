## Analysis of CVE-2014-5284

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5284:

**Description:** The vulnerability exists in OSSEC versions 0.5 through 2.8. It's a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to the insecure creation of temporary files.

**Root Cause:** The `host-deny.sh` script used by OSSEC to add and remove IP addresses from `/etc/hosts.deny` creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names based on the process ID (`/tmp/hosts.deny.$$`).

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script uses a predictable filename for the temporary file.
*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists where a local user can create the `/tmp/hosts.deny.$$` file before the root user (via the `host-deny.sh` script) overwrites it. The attacker can then modify the file before it is copied back to `/etc/hosts.deny`.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  The attacker creates a large number of `/tmp/hosts.deny.XXX` files to increase the likelihood of winning the race condition.
2.  The attacker triggers the OSSEC active response system (e.g., by repeatedly failing SSH login attempts).  This causes `host-deny.sh` to execute as root.
3.  The attacker monitors `/tmp` for the creation of the `/tmp/hosts.deny.$$` file (where `$$` is the PID of the `host-deny.sh` process).
4.  When the file is created by root, the attacker quickly overwrites it with malicious content.
5.  The `host-deny.sh` script copies the attacker's malicious content from `/tmp/hosts.deny.$$` to `/etc/hosts.deny`.

**Impact:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can gain root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By manipulating the `/etc/hosts.deny` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root when a user connects to a service (like SSH) that uses `hosts.deny` for access control. The `twist` option in `hosts.deny` is used to execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Must have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   Needs the ability to monitor file system events (e.g., using `inotify`).
*   Needs to be able to create files in `/tmp`.
*   Needs to trigger the OSSEC active response.

**Mitigation:**

The fix involves:

*   Creating the temporary file in `/var/ossec` instead of `/tmp`.
*   Using `mktemp` (where available) to create non-predictable temporary filenames.
*   Implementing a "BAD" version of `mktemp` if `mktemp` is not available.

The provided exploit code automates the creation of temp files and monitoring of changes.
