Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5386:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `mcrypt_create_iv` function in Facebook HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) did not properly seed the random number generator when generating initialization vectors (IVs) for cryptographic operations. Specifically, when `MCRYPT_RAND` was used as the source for IV generation, the code was using `rand()` without auto-seeding which leads to predictable IVs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient Randomness:** The vulnerability lies in the usage of a pseudo-random number generator (`rand()`) without proper seeding when creating IVs. The lack of proper seeding results in predictable IVs.
- **Cryptographic Weakness:** Using predictable IVs weakens the cryptographic protection offered by encryption algorithms, as it allows attackers to potentially recover the encryption key.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to compromise the cryptographic protection mechanism of the mcrypt library. Specifically, if an attacker can predict IVs, they can attempt to decrypt encrypted data or forge messages. This can lead to data exposure or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**

- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by targeting applications using the vulnerable `mcrypt_create_iv` function in HHVM, where the function is used to generate IVs. The attacker does not need to be local or have direct access to the machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the affected software and how the `mcrypt_create_iv` function is used.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application, where they can then leverage the lack of randomness in IV generation.
- The attacker does not need to have privileged access or be in a specific network position to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by modifying the function to use `f_rand()` instead of `rand()`, as `f_rand()` includes logic for auto-seeding and selection of a suitable initial seed for the RNG.
- The commit `ab6fdeb` on the `facebook/hhvm` repository addresses this vulnerability.
- This issue is noted as having a "Moderate" severity.
