  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can be achieved by intercepting network traffic on untrusted networks like public WiFi."

      "affected_applications": "Multiple Android applications are affected. A spreadsheet ([Android application SSL spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) lists the affected applications and the availability of fixes.",
        "solution": "Apply updates to the affected applications. If updates are not available, avoid using the vulnerable application or avoid using them on untrusted networks.",
