Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-5256:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue within the V8 JavaScript engine, specifically related to stack overflow. This occurs when a deep recursive workload triggers a garbage collection (GC) and receives an interrupt.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack overflow:**  A deep recursion, particularly with heavy use of `JSON.parse` on nested objects, could overflow the stack.
*   **Incorrect Stack Overflow Handling:** The V8 engine, prior to the fix, did not correctly handle stack overflows when an interrupt was pending.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a segmentation fault, causing the affected process (e.g., Node.js application, IBM BPM Configuration editor which uses node.js) to crash and terminate.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Recursive Workload:** By crafting specific workloads that trigger deep recursion, an attacker could cause a stack overflow. This can be achieved by providing deeply nested objects for parsing via methods such as `JSON.parse`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to supply or cause the processing of maliciously crafted input that results in the deep recursion.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects Node.js versions 0.8 and 0.10.
*   The fix involves ensuring stack overflows are correctly checked even when an interrupt is pending, by comparing the current stack pointer against the *real* C++ stack limit, rather than the interrupt stack limit.
*   The vulnerability also impacts products that embed the vulnerable version of Node.js. For example, IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) uses Node.js, thus is also affected.
* The provided github commit diff shows the specific code change in `deps/v8/src/isolate.h` that resolves the issue
* One of the resources mentions a deeper explanation of how a pending interrupt could mask a stack overflow in V8

In summary, CVE-2014-5256 is a stack overflow vulnerability in V8 that could lead to DoS through crafted input, corrected by a fix ensuring that stack overflows are always checked against the actual stack limit.
