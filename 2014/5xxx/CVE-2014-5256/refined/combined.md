[@indutny](https://github.com/indutny) Hello! I am currently looking through both this change and the V8 change to understand the issue more deeply. I would really appreciate it if you could help me understand why only one of the file changes in the Chromium / V8 change set referenced was backported. I can see there are some differences in the base files for the others in the change set -- did you conclude that the version of V8 that Node is currently using doesn't have a problem in these files? Was there a change to a version of V8 between the Node's current version and the version that needed to be fixed that introduced problems in those other files?

Thanks!

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@tunniclm](https://github.com/tunniclm) technically there are other changes here, but they are not making node.js vulnerable to attacks. The changeset isn't applying cleanly to our current v8 version, so I decided to go with the easiest and the most observable fix that we could have.

[@indutny](https://github.com/indutny) I see. I was a little confused for a while there because (if I understand correctly) the change was made in <https://codereview.chromium.org/11362007> "Correctly check for stack overflow even when interrupt is pending." rather than the linked change. Is that right? Or was there another reason to link to <https://codereview.chromium.org/339883002> "Interrupts must not mask stack overflow." instead?

[@indutny](https://github.com/indutny) Thanks for responses, they are very helpful!

When you look at <https://codereview.chromium.org/11362007>, it seems like there is nothing extra to backport. Would it be possible to confirm that 11362007 is the right ticket (and perhaps correct the blog post)? Or is there something more going on here that makes the original ticket 339883002 relevant - particularly regarding the security vulnerability?

The cited ticket contains the patch that you mention, so your ticket is more exact, but not more correct.

## Updated nodejs package fixes security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 09 Dec 2014

Modification date: 09 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-5256](CVE-2014-5256.html)
,
[CVE-2013-6668](CVE-2013-6668.html)

## Description

```
Updated nodejs package fixes security vulnerabilities:

A memory corruption vulnerability, which results in a denial-of-service, was
identified in the versions of V8 that ship with Node.js 0.8 and 0.10. In
certain circumstances, a particularly deep recursive workload that may trigger
a GC and receive an interrupt may overflow the stack and result in a
segmentation fault. For instance, if your work load involves successive
JSON.parse calls and the parsed objects are significantly deep, you may
experience the process aborting while parsing (CVE-2014-5256).

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Google V8 before 3.24.35.10, as used
in Node.js before 0.10.31, allow attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have other impact via unknown vectors (CVE-2013-6668).

The nodejs package has been updated to version 0.10.33 to fix these issues
as well as several other bugs.

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
