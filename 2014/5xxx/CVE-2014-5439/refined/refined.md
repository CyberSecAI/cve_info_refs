Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Sniffit packet sniffer and monitoring tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The program does not properly validate the size of input data written to a stack buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite data on the stack.
- Insufficient protection mechanisms: Sniffit does not effectively implement non-executable memory (NX), Stack Smashing Protector (SSP), or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses to gain code execution on the target system.
- Root privileges: Since Sniffit runs with root privileges, the attacker can gain a root shell, thus achieving full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious configuration file: An attacker can create a specially crafted Sniffit configuration file containing the overflow payload. This file is then used to exploit the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious configuration file to the Sniffit application, likely by tricking a user or administrator into loading the malicious configuration.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability bypasses NX, SSP, and ASLR protections.
- An exploit is publicly available.
- The vulnerability affects Sniffit version 0.3.7.
