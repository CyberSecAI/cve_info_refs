Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `gnt-cluster upgrade` command in Ganeti creates an archive of the cluster's configuration files in `/var/lib/`, using the pattern `ganeti*.tar`. These archives are created with overly permissive file permissions, allowing unprivileged users to access them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is that the generated archive files have lax permissions, allowing access to sensitive information by unauthorized users.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The archive contains sensitive data, including:
    *   SSL keys for inter-node RPC communication.
    *   Credentials for the remote API (RAPI).
    *   Potentially, other secrets such as VNC and SPICE passwords if configured to be stored within the archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain access to sensitive information that can be used to:
*   Take control of various cluster operations, such as shutting down or removing instances and nodes.
*   Assume the identity of the cluster, potentially launching a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
*   Access virtual machine consoles.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
*   Accessing a host machine where Ganeti is installed.
*   Accessing a vulnerable archive file located in `/var/lib/` due to the insecure permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have unprivileged access to the host machine where Ganeti is installed, especially to the cluster master node.
*   The attacker must have access to the `/var/lib/` directory.
*   The `gnt-cluster upgrade` command must have been run to generate the vulnerable archive files.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to Ganeti versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.6 and 2.11.0 through 2.11.4.
* Fixed versions of Ganeti address this vulnerability by setting appropriate permissions on the generated archives.
* Mitigation includes removing access to the archive for unprivileged users, renewing SSL keys, renewing RAPI credentials, and reviewing other potential secrets in `/var/lib/ganeti`.
