Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a direct command injection flaw in the Ploticus module of PHP-Wiki. Specifically, the `device` parameter within the `Ploticus` plugin is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is the lack of input sanitization for the `device` parameter. The `getImage` function takes the user-supplied device value and directly incorporates it into a shell command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that are then executed on the server.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$gif = $argarray['device'];
$args = "-$gif -o $tempfile.$gif";
$code = $this->execute(PLOTICUS_EXE . " $tempfile.plo $args", $tempfile.".$gif");
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the PHP-Wiki application, with the privileges of the web server user. This could lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the server.
    - Data theft, modification, or deletion.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Use of the compromised server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the PHP-Wiki application, specifically when editing a page containing a vulnerable `Ploticus` plugin tag.
- The vulnerable plugin tag is of the form `<<Ploticus device="[malicious command]" ... >>`
- The 'device' parameter is being set within the Ploticus plugin and then used as part of a command executed on the server
- The attacker can inject commands by modifying the `device` parameter within the `Ploticus` plugin, via a web interface form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the PHP-Wiki web interface.
- **Page Edit Rights:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit pages in the wiki. This might require an account, depending on the wiki's access control settings. However, the vulnerability does not require a specific user role.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates that the attacker injects the malicious command within the `device` parameter, using  `<<Ploticus device=";echo 123':::' 1>&2;'+cmd+' 1>&2;echo ':::'123 1>&2;" ... >>` . This command is constructed to execute an arbitrary shell command (`cmd`). The `echo` statements are used as markers to parse the output and extract the result of the injected command.
- The provided exploit also attempts to execute `uname -a` and `id`, to confirm command execution.
