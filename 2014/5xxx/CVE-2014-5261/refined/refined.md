Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-5261:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the `graph_settings.php` script in Cacti. Specifically, the font size parameter ($size) was not properly validated before being used in the rrdtool command line. The code only checked if the input started with a number, not if it was a valid number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Shell Metacharacter Injection:** Because the font size input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (like ';') into the input field. This allows the attacker to append arbitrary shell commands after the intended size value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting shell commands, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server hosting Cacti with the privileges of the webserver process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves manipulating the font size parameter within `graph_settings.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to `graph_settings.php`, which is typically accessible to authenticated users. However, the exact privileges needed for this page are not fully defined in the provided documents.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mischa Sall√© and Wilco Baan Hofman.
- The fix involves improved input sanitization within Cacti to prevent command injection.
- CVE-2014-5261 was assigned to this specific vulnerability involving shell metacharacters. A separate CVE (CVE-2014-5262) was assigned to an SQL injection vulnerability discovered at the same time, which also stems from a lack of input validation.
