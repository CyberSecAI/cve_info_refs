# CVE id request: cacti remote code execution and SQL injection

---

*From*: Nico Golde <oss-security+ml () ngolde de>

*Date*: Tue, 12 Aug 2014 23:07:21 +0200

```
Hi,
Mischa Sallé and Wilco Baan Hofman reported a security issue in cacti to
Debian when processing arguments passed to the graph settings script:
<http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7454>

We consider this issue to be public given the public fix.
Can someone assign a CVE id? We do have some indication that this was reported
in parallel Fedora, in case anyone from RedHat already assigned a CVE id to
this.

Thanks!
Nico

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1127165#c0)  Mischa Salle    2014-08-06 10:08:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem: cacti has a remote code execution and potentially SQL injection vulnerability since it does not check the input arguments on the graph_settings.php page but saves them into the SQL database. In particular the font sizes are then taken over into the rrdtool commandline in lib/rrd.php, lines 2032/2035 and further. Since there is no check whether $size is actually a number, only that it starts with a number (via the check <=4), it's possible to insert commands by adding a ';' followed by any command. Note that other similar injection vulnerabilities in cacti have been fixed recently.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): all versions of cacti upto and including cacti-0.8.8b-7 As far as I can see, all Fedora and EPEL version are vulnerable.  Additional info: This has been reported upstream as <http://bugs.cacti.net/view.php?id=2455> This issue has been found by Mischa Salle and Wilco Baan Hofman of Nikhef.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1127165#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-07 02:47:27 UTC  ``` Good morning,  Thank you very much for the report!  We can assign a CVE number if needed, and help with any coordination with other vendors and distributions before the issue is public if needed.  Cheers,  -- Murray McAllister / Red Hat Product Security   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1127165#c2)  Mischa Salle    2014-08-07 11:41:38 UTC  ``` Hi Murray,  yes, that would be a good. I also submitted a bug at Debian via security but have not yet received any feedback, so I doubt they have already requested a CVE. I asked in the upstream cacti bugtracker if they were planning to request a CVE but they did not respond.  Cheers, Mischa   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1127165#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-14 07:41:23 UTC  ``` Hi Mischa,  This issue seems public now:  <http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7454>  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/12/5>  I'll open this bug up and close it as a duplicate of a fedora tracker that was filed.  We will wait until MITRE responds to the oss-security mail with a CVE, to avoid us assigning any duplicates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1127165#c4)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-14 07:42:44 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 1129763](show_bug.cgi?id=1129763 "CLOSED CANTFIX - cacti: remote code execution and SQL injection [fedora-all]") ***   ``` |  |
