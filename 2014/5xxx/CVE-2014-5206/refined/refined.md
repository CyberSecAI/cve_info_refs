Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles read-only bind mounts within user namespaces. Specifically, when remounting a read-only bind mount as read-only within a user namespace, the `MNT_LOCK_READONLY` flag could be cleared. This allows an unprivileged user to subsequently remount the read-only mount as read-write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Mount Flag Locking:** The `MNT_LOCK_READONLY` flag, intended to prevent unauthorized changes to read-only mounts, was not correctly preserved during remount operations within user namespaces.
- **User Namespace Bypass:**  The user namespace mechanism did not properly isolate mount flag modifications, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate mount attributes of mounts created by more privileged users, violating the intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user within a user namespace could gain write access to a mount that should have been read-only. This could potentially lead to the attacker being able to modify critical system files or escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who has the ability to create and manipulate mounts within a user namespace.
- **Remount Operation:** The attacker remounts a read-only bind mount, initially set up by a privileged user, to gain write access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Namespace Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a user namespace.
- **Bind Mount Access:** The attacker must have access to a read-only bind mount created by a more privileged user.
- **Mount Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to perform remount operations within the user namespace.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves correctly preserving mount flags during remount operations by using a mask of flags that *may* be changed instead of a mask of flags to preserve, ensuring that new flags will simply not change if not explicitly allowed by the mask.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Kenton Varda.
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2014-5207, which addresses additional issues with mount flag locking.
- The issue is addressed in Linux kernel versions 3.13.0-34.60 and later.
- Red Hat has marked this as 'Not Vulnerable' for RHEL 5,6,7 and MRG2.
