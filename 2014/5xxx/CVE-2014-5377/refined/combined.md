### DeviceExpert Build 5200

**New Features / Enhancements**

* **SNMP v3 Support**: DeviceExpert now supports SNMP v3 for device discovery, configuration retrieval for Cisco devices and for switch-port mapping functionality.This allows leveraging the additional security measures of SNMP v3.
* Enhancements have been made to the forwarded syslog messages listening feature with provision to specify the list of IP addresses from where syslog messages would be forwarded to DeviceExpert for real-time change detection. Previously, DeviceExpert expected the syslog message to come directly from the devices that undergo configuration change. With this new feature, syslog messages which get forwarded from a common syslog server (complying to RFC 3164 ) can also be used to detect configuration changes in real-time.
* For Netscreen devices, real-time change detection is now done based on more conditions. For example, earlier, cases like forced telnet logout were not considered for change detection. Now, more such conditions are considered.
* SSH-based configuration retrieval support is now extended to Cisco ASA and Nortel Passport devices.
* **New OS Support:** DeviceExpert now runs on Windows XP 64 bit, Windows 2008 Server, CentOS and Suse Linux
* **Support for New Device Vendors & Models:** Avaya, UTM-1 Edge X version 7.5.55x, Lambda Driver 800, Dax Devices, Cisco ACE Module, Cisco Wide Area Application Services Software (WAAS), Cisco IOS XR

**Changes**

* For real-time change detection, when syslog messages were sent from devices, DeviceExpert identified the changes only when the exact IP of the device was present. This made real-time change detection not working in devices having multiple interfaces where the message came randomly from one of the interfaces. Now, DeviceExpert will look into the interface table of the device and consider all the interfaces.
* A few models of Enterasys devices expect carriage return (Ctrl+Y) for logging in. Those type of devices are supported now.

**Bug Fixes**

* Earlier, SSH-based configuration retrieval was not working with Foundry, Extreme and Enterasys devices. It is now fixed.
* Earlier, when the entries in Configuration Changes report and Configuration Change Trend report spanned over more than one page, the entries after the first page were not visible. This issue has now been fixed.
* In Nortel Baystack devices, configuration retrieval failed due to an issue in populating the hardware properties of the device. This issue has been fixed.
* In scheduled configuration backup, the hardware properties of the devices were not updated. This issue has now been fixed.
* Earlier, for Aruba devices, there were issues in populating the hardware details. This has been fixed.
* In Cisco WLAN controller, configuration backup through TELNET-TFTP did not work. This has been fixed.
* Earlier, when generating Configuration Change report as PDF, some entries were missing. This issue has been fixed.
* In Widows 2003 and Vista, DeviceExpert port check tool showed wrong port status for Syslog service. This has now been fixed.

### DeviceExpert Build 5110

**New Features / Enhancements**

* Support for retrieving the configurations of Netscreen firewalls through SSH or TELNET without using TFTP
* **Switch Port Mapper:** New functionality, which identifies the list of devices connected to each port of the managed switch. This eliminates the need for manually maintaining a record on port details and connected devices.
* Provision for editing and updating host names of devices in bulk. During the device discovery or device addition process, device names might not get recorded correctly due to DNS issues. This can be corrected later by updating hostnames in bulk by providing the list of host names in a standard flat file
* Provision to listen for syslog messages from a central syslog server for use in real-time change detection. Previously, DeviceExpert expected the syslog message to come directly from the devices that undergo configuration change. With this new feature, syslog messages which get forwarded from a common syslog server (complying to RFC 3164 ) can also be used to detect configuration changes in real-time
* Support for new device vendors & models - Cisco WLAN controller, Nortel Networks Layer 2-3 GbE Switch Module, Brocade 200E, Radware Web Server Director Pro AS, many Enterasys models
* Support for Nortel Baystack Switch which can login to command line mode directly

**Changes**

* Earlier, the execution output of custom templates were visible to all users. As this feature is widely used to carryout critical configuration changes like password rotation, firewall rule configuration etc. DeviceExpert now provides the option for removing the execution output. In addition, execution output will be visible only to the administrator and the user who executes the custom template
* Configuration retrieval/upload over SCP is now supported for Cisco switches and Brocade devices also.

**Bug Fixes**

* When a DeviceExpert user was deleted, both public and private groups created by the user got deleted. Now, the issue has been fixed and only the private groups held by the user willget deleted.

Hi Keith,

Thanks for pointing this out.
I realised the advisory is not very clear - you are right, it is a base 64
encoded md5 hash. To get the actual hash you have to use the following Ruby
code:
Base64.decode64(password).unpack('H*')

The hash is a md5 of
"admin12345678"

Also ManageEngine have decided to fix the issue, and have now released
version 5.9 build 5981 that resolves this vulnerability.

I've updated the advisory at
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/me_deviceexpert-5.txt>

Regards
Pedro

Hi,

You can read the usernames and MD5 hashed passwords of all the users
in the Device Expert application by sending an unauthenticated
request.
I am releasing this as a 0 day as ManageEngine have responded that
they do not consider this a priority and won't fix it in the near
future unless a customer requests it. See details below.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
