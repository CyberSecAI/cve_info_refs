Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-5382:

**Vulnerability Overview**
The content describes multiple critical vulnerabilities in the Schrack MICROCONTROL emergency light system. This includes:

1.  **Access Data Disclosure:** FTP and Telnet service access credentials are in clear text and accessible without authentication via `http://<system_ip>/ZTPUsrDtls.txt`.
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of access controls and secure storage for sensitive credentials.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Exposure of credentials in a publicly accessible file, insecure configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the system's file system, allowing an attacker to reconfigure the entire system.
    *   **Attack vector:** HTTP request to retrieve the credentials file.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Network access to the device.

2.  **Weak Default Password:** The web interface uses a hardcoded, unchangeable, weak default password ("not" for user "user").
    *   **Root cause:** Use of a weak default password that cannot be changed by the user.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Predictable authentication credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the web interface, allowing an attacker to reconfigure the system through this interface.
    *  **Attack vector:** Brute-force or use of known default credentials on the web interface.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Network access to the device.

3.  **Permanent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  User input is not properly encoded, allowing persistent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied data (lack of input sanitization).
    *   **Weaknesses:**  XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent inclusion of malicious HTML or JavaScript on the web pages, leading to theft of user credentials, redirection to malicious sites, and potential browser exploits.
    *   **Attack vector:** Injection of malicious code via user input fields.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Access to the web interface.

4.  **Clear Text Authentication:** User login data is transmitted in clear text.
    *   **Root cause:** Use of HTTP protocol for login and communication of sensitive information.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of encryption for sensitive data in transit.
    *  **Impact:** Credentials can be eavesdropped using network sniffing, allowing an attacker to compromise user accounts.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network sniffing/packet capture during the login process.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to capture network traffic between the user and the device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions a telnet service running as a plain text protocol which adds another vulnerable attack vector.
*   The advisory was issued by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab on July 10, 2014.
*   The affected version is before 1.7.0 (937) of the Schrack MICROCONTROL emergency light system. The fixed version is 1.7.0 (937).
*   The vendor recommends using a separate network segment for the device as a workaround for clear text authentication because SSL is unavailable.
