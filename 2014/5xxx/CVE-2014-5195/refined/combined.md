### Bug Description

After upgrading to Unity version 7.2.2+14.04.20140714-0ubuntu1 on Trusty, the lockscreen sometimes fails to take the keyboard focus away from Chrome.

This might happen if there's a text selection in Chrome, and also when resuming after suspend.

It doesn't always happen, as this is a race condition, but it's easy to reproduce by selecting the location bar in Chrome and then locking the screen.

Workaround: click on any indicator in the upper right corner, and close the menu. After that, keyboard input is sent to the lockscreen again.

Update:

Another workaround: change the language in the upper right corner, in my case switch from En1 to En2. After that, the password box accepts keyboard input and shows corresponding dots.

seems like the issue is rather unity/the lockscreen, reassigning there (setting the bug as confirmed, Didier had that issue as well on trusty)

When not accepting/showing input from the keyboard, there is the usual vertical blinking line in the password box (so: 'showing' it is accepting input there), with the word "password" in the background of that password box.

Would it help if I post a picture of video of what goes (or: doesn't go) on?

This happens on my Dell XPS13 laptop. Here are the steps:

- Close the lid

- Wait a minute

- Open it back up

The login screen appears. The cursor is in the password area and is flashing. Nothing I type on the keyboard does anything.

- Click on anything in the top bar -- the battery indicator, or the gear icon, or the clock

- Hit escape or click on the password box again

Now it works.

- Type my password and log in

This part is interesting: the things I was typing when attempting to log in have been entered into the OS. In other words, if I had a browser window up, my password attempts are there in the address bar. So the things that I type on the login screen, when not accepted by the login screen, are actually being accepted by the underlying operating system.

One more note, in case this is helpful to developers: This \*sometimes\* happens after closing the lid and reopening. It \*never\* happens after locking the system using ctrl-alt-L.

As mentioned in the duplicate bug, if you have text selected, this also happens without suspending.

Also, I've retitled this bug since the bug is much much worse than not taking the input, the input is actually sent to the underlying Chrome window, so people that type their password without paying too much attention are at risk of sending their password over hangouts or similar.

It looks like this was fixed in Trusty, but I don't see any messages indicating it was fixed in Utopic. Can someone verify and ensure this is also fixed in the development release? Thanks

unity (7.3.0+14.10.20140731.1-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=low

  \* New rebuild forced

    #1350052)

[ Andrea Azzarone ]

  \* == Problem == Lockscreen capslock detection doesn't work well with

    remapped capslocks == Fix == Use gdk keymap to get the state of the

    caps lock. (LP: [#1347735](/bugs/1347735))

[ Marco Trevisan (Treviño) ]

  \* PlacesOverlayVScrollBar and VScrollBarOverlayWindow: add support for

    scaling Add a new ScrollView class to create ScrollViews with an

    OverlayScrollbar and with scaling support. Using them in dash Scopes

    and Previews. (LP: [#1340996](/bugs/1340996))

  \* LockScreenShield: Add GrabScreen function and retry to make sure we

    really get grab It might happen that the grab is not possible

    because the PluginAdapter::IsScreenGrabbed request has still not

    being fully processed, and thus nux is not able to grab the

    pointer/keyboard. By doing this we instead try to grab the screen,

    and if this is not happening, we wait a little until we don't get

    the ungrab event. In this way, if we eventually get the grab, all

    will work as expected. Otherwise, we cancel the lock request (very

    unlikely to happen). (LP: [#1349128](/bugs/1349128))

  \* PlacesOverlayVScrollBar: redirect the mouse wheel scroll events

    delta/+merge/227070, this means that this code would just work as it

    used to do (except for the SwitcerView fix) if that nux branch is

    not used, while it will support correctly horizontal scroll events

I see this is being treated as critical, but does that also mean it is being treated as a security issue? I found my password in plain text after applying the work around, and if that were a chat application that's a pretty serious security breach.

# USN-2303-1: Unity vulnerability

31 July 2014

The Unity lock screen could possibly be bypassed in certain circumstances.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [unity](/security/cves?package=unity) - Interface designed for efficiency of space and interaction.

## Details

It was discovered that in certain circumstances Unity failed to

successfully grab the keyboard when switching to the lock screen. A local

attacker could possibly use this issue to run commands, and unlock the

current session.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.
