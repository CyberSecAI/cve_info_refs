⚠️️️ Please note that this release is a part of [CKEditor 4 Extended Support Model](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/), only available to customers who decided to acquire the LTS (Long Term Support) version of the editor. **All editor versions below 4.25.0-lts can no longer be considered as secure!** ⚠️

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in [Code Snippet GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) plugin reported by [Jiasheng He](https://github.com/Hebing123) from Qihoo 360.

  Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the [GeSHi syntax highlighter library](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0) hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-7r32-vfj5-c2jv) for more details.
* Fixed low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential domain takeover

  Issue summery: A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the [https://cke4.ckeditor.com](https://cke4.ckeditor.com/) domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although the vulnerability is purely hypothetical, we have addressed it in CKEditor 4.25.0-lts to ensure compliance with security best practices. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-6v96-m24v-f58j) for more details.

You can read more details in the relevant security advisories. [Contact us](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/security%40cksource.com) if you have more questions.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

Updated dependencies:

* **CodeMirror** (used only in the [Toolbar Configurator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/toolbar.html#toolbar-configurator) in samples) has been updated to v5.65.17 for improved stability and performance.
* **Highlight.js** (used by the [Code Snippet](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippet) plugin) has been updated to v11.9.0, introducing **two breaking changes**:

  + dropped support for Internet Explorer,
  + updated list of the supported themes – some of the themes are no longer officially supported, others may have their names changed (e.g. `monokai_sublime` is now `monokai-sublime`). Please verify the value of your [`config.codeSnippet_theme`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-codeSnippet_theme) configuration option and adjust theme names as needed. The list of available themes can be checked in the `plugins/codesnippet/lib/highlight/styles` directory.

* [#5410](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5410): Added the ability to indicate the language of styles in the [Styles Combo](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/stylescombo) plugin via the [`config.styleSet`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-stylesSet) configuration option.
* [#5510](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5510): Added notification system to the editor informing users that the editor version is up-to-date and secure.

**Security Updates:**

A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting [Iframe Dialog](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe) and [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) plugins.

This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. See [GitHub advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-xwqv-cv9g) for more details.

**Potential breaking changes**

In some rare cases, a security release may introduce a breaking change to your application. We have provided configuration options that will help you mitigate any potential issues with the upgrade:

* Starting from version 4.21, the [Iframe Dialog](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe) plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the [`config.iframe_attributes`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-iframe_attributes) option.
* Starting from version 4.21, the [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the [`config.embed_keepOriginalContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-embed_keepOriginalContent) option.

If you choose to change either of the above options, make sure to properly configure [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on your web page.

You can read more details in the relevant security advisory and [contact us](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/security%40cksource.com) if you have more questions.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

* [#4400](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4400): Added the [`config.uploadImage_supportedTypes`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uploadImage_supportedTypes) configuration option allowing to change the image formats accepted by the [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) plugin. Thanks to [SilverYoCha](https://github.com/SilverYoCha)!

Fixed Issues:

* [#5431](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5431): Fixed: No notification is shown when pasting or dropping unsupported image types into the editor.

This option, combined with [`config.title`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-title), gives much better control over the editor's labels read by screen readers.

Fixed Issues:

* [#4543](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4543): Fixed: Toolbar buttons toggle state is not correctly announced by screen readers lacking the information whether the feature is on or off.
* [#4052](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4052): Fixed: Editor labels are read incorrectly by screen readers due to invalid editor control type for the [Iframe Editing Area](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wysiwygarea) editors.
* [#1904](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/1904): Fixed: Screen readers are not announcing the read-only editor state.
* [#4904](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4904): Fixed: Table cell selection and navigation with the `tab` key behavior is inconsistent after adding a new row.
* [#3394](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3394): Fixed: [Enhanced image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) plugin dialog is not supporting URL with query string parameters. Thanks to [Simon Urli](https://github.com/surli)!
* [#5049](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5049): Fixed: The editor fails in strict mode due to not following the `use strict` directives in a core editor module.
* [#5095](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5095): Fixed: The [clipboard](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/clipboard) plugin shows notification about unsupported file format when the file type is different than `jpg`, `gif`, `png`, not respecting [supported types](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_fileTools_uploadWidgetDefinition.html#property-supportedTypes) by the [Upload Widget](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadwidget) plugin.
* [#4855](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4855): [iOS] Fixed: Focusing toolbar buttons with an enabled VoiceOver screen reader moves the browser focus into an editable area and interrupts button functionality.

API changes:

* [#4641](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4641): The [`CKEDITOR.replace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-replace), [`CKEDITOR.inline`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-inline), [`CKEDITOR.appendTo`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#method-appendTo) functions are now returning a handle function allowing to cancel the [Delayed Editor Creation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/delayed_creation.html) feature.
* [#5095](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5095): Added the [CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.addFileMatcher](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_clipboard.html#method-addFileMatcher) function allowing to define file formats supported by the [clipboard](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/clipboard) plugin. Trying to paste unsupported files will result in a notification that a file cannot be dropped or pasted into the editor.
* [#2445](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2445): Added [`config.applicationTitle`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-applicationTitle) alongside [`CKEDITOR.editor#applicationTitle`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-applicationTitle) to allow customizing editor's application region label.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
