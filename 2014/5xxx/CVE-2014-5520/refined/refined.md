{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the application's reliance on user-controlled session data, which is not properly sanitized, leading to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Unsanitized session data",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve admin credentials, gain unauthorized access, and execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests",
      "Session manipulation",
	  "Web interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker can inject SQL payloads via the user_id parameter of the new-form.php webform plugin."
  },
  "technical_details": {
    "session_poisoning": "The vulnerability occurs due to $_SESSION poisoning. The attacker can inject SQLi payloads through the user_id parameter in /plugins/webform/new-form.php.",
    "sqli_payload": "The SQL injection is performed using a crafted payload in the `user_id` parameter, typically through a UNION ALL SELECT statement. This is used to leak information from the database by exploiting blind SQL injection techniques that use time-based benchmark and substring comparison.",
    "command_execution": "After retrieving admin credentials, the attacker authenticates to the application and leverages a command injection vulnerability in `/plugins/useradmin/fingeruser.php` by injecting code into the username parameter. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.",
	"exploit_chain": "The exploit chain begins with poisoning the $_SESSION, leading to SQL injection, which is then leveraged to obtain valid credentials, which, in turn, are used to exploit a command injection vulnerability."
