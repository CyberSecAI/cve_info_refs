{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The license directory `/etc/zarafa/license/` has default permissions of 755, allowing any local user to access and copy license files. Additionally, license files are recommended to be created with `echo`, which typically results in root:root ownership and 644 permissions, exacerbating the issue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "Local system users can access and copy the license key files, which might have an adverse effect on the vendor's revenue, and depending on vendor's license key validation mechanisms, may cause an adverse effect on the availability of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Any local user can read the license files due to the directory permissions and default file creation method."
