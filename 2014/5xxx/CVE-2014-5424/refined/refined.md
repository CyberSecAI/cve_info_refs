Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a software coding error in the custom ActiveX components of Rockwell Automation's Connected Components Workbench (CCW) application. This is further compounded by using an older compiler to create these components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method:** The core vulnerability lies in the exposed ActiveX methods that allow an attacker to send arbitrary out-of-range values to a specific property. This leads to a crash of the component.
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** By sending arbitrary values, an attacker can potentially write arbitrary code to memory locations not normally accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
- **Crash the ActiveX component.**
- **Execute unauthorized code** on the computer hosting the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** Exploitation can occur remotely through social engineering tactics.
- **Local Exploitation:**  Exploitation can occur via local access to the computer.
- **Delivery Methods:**  Attackers can deliver malicious code through infected web pages, documents opened in web browsers, or any other container capable of running ActiveX controls.
- **Phishing:** Attackers might use phishing attacks to convince victims to open malicious HTML files or visit malicious web pages designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill Level:** An attacker with low technical skill is capable of exploiting this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with malicious content (e.g. opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage). The user needs to have local access to a computer with the vulnerable ActiveX component.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists even if the CCW software or the vulnerable ActiveX component is not actively running.
-  The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-5424 and has a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
