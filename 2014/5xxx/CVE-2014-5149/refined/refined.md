Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that certain MMU (Memory Management Unit) virtualization operations in Xen for HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests that do not use Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP), are not preemptible. These operations must process every page assigned to a guest, and for large guests, this can tie up a vCPU for a considerable time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of preemption for MMU operations: Long-latency MMU virtualization operations are not preemptible, causing a vCPU to be occupied for an extended period.
- This is specifically for guests not using HAP(shadow pagetables).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious HVM guest with a large allocation of shadow/p2m RAM can cause a denial of service attack, affecting the whole system, because a vCPU is tied up for a long time, preventing it from attending to other guests or hypervisor tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious HVM Guest: A malicious HVM guest is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Large Memory Allocation: The guest needs a large allocation of shadow/p2m RAM to trigger the long-latency MMU operations. The default configuration exposes this vulnerability for guests larger than 128GB of memory, however it also depends on shadow memory allocation and can be triggered with a smaller guest if the shadow memory is overriden.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control an HVM guest on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- The attacker needs to be able to allocate a large amount of shadow/p2m RAM to the guest.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability only affects HVM guests and not PV guests.
- The vulnerability is present in all x86 versions of Xen. ARM systems are not affected.
- A fix exists for HAP-enabled guests.
- There was no resolution for guests using shadow page tables (i.e. not using HAP) at the time of the advisory.
- The provided content also indicates that CVE-2014-5146 is related to the same issue but for HVM guests using HAP.
- The openSUSE advisory mentions that this issue is fixed by upgrading Xen.
- Gentoo's advisory notes the severity as "high" and exploitable locally, which aligns with the described attack vector of a malicious HVM guest causing a DoS.
