Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way SAP Crystal Reports handles connection string records within RPT files. Specifically, the issue is a double-free vulnerability triggered during the processing of these connection strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double Free vulnerability: This type of vulnerability occurs when memory is freed more than once, which can lead to corruption of the heap and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the context of the current process running Crystal Reports.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious RPT Files: The primary attack vector is through crafting and delivering a malicious RPT file to a target user.
- Malicious Web Pages: Users visiting a malicious web page could be exploited if the page triggers the processing of a malicious RPT file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote: The attacker can be remote.
- User Interaction: The attack requires some form of user interaction, such as opening a malicious RPT file or visiting a malicious web page.
