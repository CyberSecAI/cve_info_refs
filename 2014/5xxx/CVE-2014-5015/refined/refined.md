- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A call to `snprintf()` was not properly checking for truncation of a provided user path, allowing a later concatenation of the ".htpasswd" filename to exceed the maximum pathname length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path handling and truncation leading to an authentication bypass. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the application constructs the path to the `.htpasswd` file, a file used for basic HTTP authentication. When the user-provided path is too long, `snprintf()` truncates the path, but the code does not detect this truncation. Then, the code concatenates ".htpasswd" to this truncated path, potentially causing the resulting string to be too long, but also, more importantly,  it results in the check for .htpasswd file to fail, effectively bypassing the authentication scheme.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote users can bypass basic HTTP authentication and gain access to protected files.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can provide a long path string in a request that interacts with the vulnerable code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `bozohttpd` application. No prior authentication or local access is required.
