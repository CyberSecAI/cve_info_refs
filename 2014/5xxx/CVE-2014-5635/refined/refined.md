{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically not verifying that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker on the same network may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by an attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device. This includes untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi."
