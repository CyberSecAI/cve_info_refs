- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Yokogawa CENTUM series and Exaopc products have an improper authentication vulnerability in the BKBCopyD.exe service, which listens on port 20111/TCP when the Batch Management Packages are installed. This service does not require authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287). The lack of authentication allows unauthorized access to the BKBCopyD.exe service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    - Leak the CENTUM project database location.
    - Read arbitrary files.
    - Write arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access to port 20111/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low skill is capable of exploiting this vulnerability. They would need network access to the vulnerable service running on port 20111/TCP. Publicly available exploit code exists for this vulnerability.
