  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates.",
       "Failure to validate the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities (CAs)."

      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.",
       "Interception of network traffic that should be encrypted via HTTPS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
