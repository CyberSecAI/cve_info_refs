The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Improved User Search in Backend" WordPress plugin, but the CVE ID mentioned in the content is **CVE-2014-5157**, not CVE-2014-5196.

The security advisory describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly sanitize user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the `iusib_meta_fields` parameter. A CSRF vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to trick an administrator into submitting the form using a malicious page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be stored in the plugin settings and executed in the administrator's browser when they access the relevant settings page.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a form containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser. This would allow the attacker to perform administrative actions such as creating new users, deleting posts, changing settings, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can create a malicious page with a form that targets the vulnerable plugin settings page with the XSS payload.
*  **Social engineering (Spearphishing):** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious page that an administrator can be tricked into visiting.
*   The attacker does not need any specific access to the WordPress instance.
