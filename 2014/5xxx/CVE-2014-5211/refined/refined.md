Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow within the Attachmate Reflection FTP Client. Specifically, the flaw occurs when parsing the response to a `PWD` command from the FTP server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The client software copies part of the FTP server's response to a fixed-length buffer allocated on the stack. This buffer is not large enough to handle an oversized response from a malicious server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By sending an overly large response to the `PWD` command, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user running the FTP client.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** This is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, meaning an attacker can gain control of the victim's machine from a remote location.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** An attacker would need to set up a malicious FTP server that sends the oversized `PWD` response.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim must connect to the attacker's malicious FTP server using the vulnerable Attachmate Reflection FTP Client for the exploit to work. This can be achieved by tricking the user into visiting a malicious webpage, or by convincing them to open a malicious file that triggers the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be reachable via network for the vulnerable client.
*   **Malicious Server Setup:** The attacker must be capable of setting up an FTP server and sending crafted responses to specific FTP commands to trigger the overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into connecting to the malicious server.

**Additional Details:**
*   Attachmate released a patch to address this vulnerability.
