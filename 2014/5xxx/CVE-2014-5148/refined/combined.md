How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

              Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-5148 / XSA-103
                                version 3

 Flaw in handling unknown system register access from 64-bit userspace on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When handling an unknown system register access from 64-bit userspace
Xen would incorrectly return to the second instruction of the trap
handler for faults in kernel space rather than the first instruction
of the trap handler for faults in 64-bit userspace.

Any user in a guest which is running a 64-bit kernel who is able to
spawn a 64-bit process can cause a trap to the kernel to be taken at
an unexpected (but not user controlled) exception address.

Known versions of Linux in the default configuration will Oops and kill the
offending process, and therefore avoid this vulnerability. However local
configuration may turn such an Oops into a kernel panic, and therefore a
guest denial of service.

IMPACT
======

Depending on the guest kernel implementation, kernel crash (guest DoS)
or privilege elevation to that of the guest kernel cannot be ruled
out.

This issue does not enable an attack on the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

64-bit ARM systems may be vulnerable, depending on the guest kernel.

All versions of Linux released by Linux upstream to date avoid this
vulnerability.  Systems based on modified versions of Linux may be
vulnerable.

32-bit ARM systems, and X86 systems, are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation for this issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was reported as a bug by Riku Voipio, discovered via
Linaro's LAVA testing and was diagnosed as a security issue by Ian
Campbell.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

The patch for XSA-103 (specifically, xsa102-*-02.patch) must be
applied first.
