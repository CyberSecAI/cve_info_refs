Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Huawei E5332 webserver is vulnerable to a memory overflow when parsing a specially crafted HTTP request message with an extremely long URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The webserver fails to properly validate the length of the URL in an HTTP request, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the device to become unresponsive, requiring a reboot by sending a crafted HTTP request, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (Adjacent Network):** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device (i.e. adjacent network) to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be connected to the same network as the vulnerable Huawei E5332 device.
- The attacker must have the ability to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the device.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to send requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered by sending an HTTP request with a very long URL.
- The vulnerability leads to a memory overflow.
- Huawei assigned this vulnerability ID as HWPSIRT-2014-0861.

This information aligns with the official CVE description.
