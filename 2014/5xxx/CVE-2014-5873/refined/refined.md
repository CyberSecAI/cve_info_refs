**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper SSL certificate validation
*   Failure to verify the SSL chain of trust

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   Viewing or modification of network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
*   Credential stealing.
*   Arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
*   Exploitation through untrusted networks, including public WiFi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network proximity to the vulnerable device.
* Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM capability).
