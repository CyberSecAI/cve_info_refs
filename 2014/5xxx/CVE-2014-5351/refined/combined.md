Debian Bug     : 728845 762479 773226 778647 819468 832572

Kerberos, a system for authenticating users and services on a network,
was affected by several vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2013-1418
    Kerberos allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted request
    when multiple realms are configured.

CVE-2014-5351
    Kerberos sends old keys in a response to a -randkey -keepold
    request, which allows remote authenticated users to forge tickets by
    leveraging administrative access.

CVE-2014-5353
    When the KDC uses LDAP, allows remote authenticated users to cause a
    denial of service (daemon crash) via a successful LDAP query with no
    results, as demonstrated by using an incorrect object type for a
    password policy.

CVE-2014-5355
    Kerberos expects that a krb5_read_message data field is represented
    as a string ending with a '\0' character, which allows remote
    attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference) via a zero-byte version string or (2) cause a denial of
    service (out-of-bounds read) by omitting the '\0' character,

CVE-2016-3119
    Kerberos allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
    service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted
    request to modify a principal.

CVE-2016-3120
    Kerberos allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
    service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an S4U2Self
    request.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
MIT kerberos krb5 was updated to fix several security issues and bugs.
Security issues fixed: CVE-2014-5351: The kadm5\_randkey\_principal\_3
function in lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_principal.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5
(aka krb5) sent old keys in a response to a -randkey -keepold request,
which allowed remote authenticated users to forge tickets by leveraging
administrative access.
CVE-2014-5352: In the MIT krb5 libgssapi\_krb5 library, after
gss\_process\_context\_token() is used to process a valid context deletion
token, the caller was left with a security context handle containing a
dangling pointer. Further uses of this handle would have resulted in
use-after-free and double-free memory access violations. libgssrpc server
applications such as kadmind were vulnerable as they can be instructed to
call gss\_process\_context\_token().
CVE-2014-9421: If the MIT krb5 kadmind daemon receives invalid XDR data
from an authenticated user, it may have performed use-after-free and
double-free memory access violations while cleaning up the partial
deserialization results. Other libgssrpc server applications might also
been vulnerable if they contain insufficiently defensive XDR functions.
CVE-2014-9422: The MIT krb5 kadmind daemon incorrectly accepted
authentications to two-component server principals whose first component
is a left substring of "kadmin" or whose realm is a left prefix of the
default realm.
CVE-2014-9423: libgssrpc applications including kadmind output four or
eight bytes of uninitialized memory to the network as part of an unused
"handle" field in replies to clients.
Bugs fixed:
- Work around replay cache creation race; (bnc#898439).

In kadmind's randkey operation, if a client specifies the keepold
flag, do not include the preserved old keys in the response.

[CVE-2014-5351](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j87f-3fmr-m923 "CVE-2014-5351"):

An authenticated remote attacker can retrieve the current keys for a
service principal when generating a new set of keys for that
principal.  The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user who has
the elevated privilege for randomizing the keys of other principals.

Normally, when a Kerberos administrator randomizes the keys of a
service principal, kadmind returns only the new keys.  This prevents
an administrator who lacks legitimate privileged access to a service
from forging tickets to authenticate to that service.  If the
"keepold" flag to the kadmin randkey RPC operation is true, kadmind
retains the old keys in the KDC database as intended, but also
unexpectedly returns the old keys to the client, which exposes the
service to ticket forgery attacks from the administrator.

A mitigating factor is that legitimate clients of the affected service
will start failing to authenticate to the service once they begin to
receive service tickets encrypted in the new keys.  The affected
service will be unable to decrypt the newly issued tickets, possibly
alerting the legitimate administrator of the affected service.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for krb5
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0255-1
Rating: moderate
References: #897874 #898439 #912002
Cross-References: CVE-2014-5351 CVE-2014-5352 CVE-2014-9421

Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
krb5 was updated to fix five security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2014-5351: current keys returned when randomizing the keys for a
service principal (bnc#897874)
- CVE-2014-5352: An authenticated attacker could cause a vulnerable
application (including kadmind) to crash or to execute arbitrary code
(bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9421: An authenticated attacker could cause kadmind or other
vulnerable server application to crash or to execute arbitrary code
(bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9422: An attacker who possess the key of a particularly named
principal (such as "kad/root") could impersonate any user to kadmind and
perform administrative actions as that user (bnc#912002).
- CVE-2014-9423: An attacker could attempt to glean sensitive information
from the four or eight bytes of uninitialized data output by kadmind or
other libgssrpc server application. Because MIT krb5 generally
sanitizes memory containing krb5 keys before freeing it, it is unlikely
that kadmind would leak Kerberos key information, but it is not
impossible (bnc#912002).
This non-security issue was fixed:
- Work around replay cache creation race (bnc#898439).
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-128=1

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1145425#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-23 04:21:17 UTC  ``` It was reported that if a privileged user randomized the keys for a service principal, the old key would be returned to them. This could lead to ticket forgery attacks on the service in question.  This issue has been fixed in upstream version 1.13. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are affected.  Full details from the upstream report:  "" An authenticated remote attacker can retrieve the current keys for a service principal when generating a new set of keys for that principal.  The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user who has the elevated privilege for randomizing the keys of other principals.  Normally, when a Kerberos administrator randomizes the keys of a service principal, kadmind returns only the new keys.  This prevents an administrator who lacks legitimate privileged access to a service from forging tickets to authenticate to that service.  If the "keepold" flag to the kadmin randkey RPC operation is true, kadmind retains the old keys in the KDC database as intended, but also unexpectedly returns the old keys to the client, which exposes the service to ticket forgery attacks from the administrator.  A mitigating factor is that legitimate clients of the affected service will start failing to authenticate to the service once they begin to receive service tickets encrypted in the new keys.  The affected service will be unable to decrypt the newly issued tickets, possibly alerting the legitimate administrator of the affected service. ""  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/af0ed4df4dfae762ab5fb605f5a0c8f59cb4f6ca>  References:  <http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=8018>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1145425#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-23 04:21:49 UTC  ```  Created krb5 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1145426](show_bug.cgi?id=1145426 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-5351 krb5: current keys returned when randomizing the keys for a service principal [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1145425#c3)  Fedora Update System    2014-10-08 19:01:51 UTC  ``` krb5-1.12.2-9.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) - MIT Kerberos Network Authentication Protocol

## Details

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly sent old keys in response to a

-randkey -keepold request. An authenticated remote attacker could use this

issue to forge tickets by leveraging administrative access. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-5351](/security/CVE-2014-5351))

It was discovered that the libgssapi\_krb5 library incorrectly processed

security context handles. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-5352](/security/CVE-2014-5352))

Patrik Kis discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled LDAP queries with

no results. An authenticated remote attacker could use this issue to cause

the KDC to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5353](/security/CVE-2014-5353))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled creating database

entries for a keyless principal when using LDAP. An authenticated remote

attacker could use this issue to cause the KDC to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-5354](/security/CVE-2014-5354))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled memory when processing

XDR data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause kadmind to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-9421](/security/CVE-2014-9421))

It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled two-component server

principals. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform impersonation

attacks. ([CVE-2014-9422](/security/CVE-2014-9422))

It was discovered that the libgssrpc library leaked uninitialized bytes. A

remote attacker could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2014-9423](/security/CVE-2014-9423))
