    "Source": "seclists.org_edde116a_20250125_142106.html",
    "Root cause": "Directory traversal vulnerability when uploading attachments.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "File upload"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution as SYSTEM/root by uploading a malicious EAR file which gets deployed automatically.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/common/FileAttachment.jsp` or `/workorder/Attachment.jsp` with a multipart/form-data request containing an EAR file and directory traversal sequences in the 'module' parameter.",
    "Required capabilities": "An authenticated user, though the default low-privilege 'guest' account can be used.  For IT360 targets, the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance is needed."

    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_8d29db54_20250125_142113.html",
     "Root cause": "Directory traversal vulnerability during file upload.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
        "File upload",
       "Improper handling of '../' sequences"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution, achieved by writing a malicious EAR file to the server's deployment directory.",
     "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request with a multipart/form-data content, including a malicious EAR file, sent to the `/common/FileAttachment.jsp` or `/workorder/Attachment.jsp` endpoint. Path traversal using `../` sequences within the upload path.",
    "Required capabilities": "Requires authentication, but the default 'guest' account can be used, or a pre-authenticated cookie can be supplied, or a username/password combination."
