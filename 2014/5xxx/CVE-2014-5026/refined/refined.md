Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5026:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in multiple Cacti files. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is specifically an XSS issue, where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users. The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating or modifying certain objects within Cacti.
-  Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when creating or modifying Graph Trees, CDEFs, Data Sources, Graphs, Data Input Methods, Graph Templates, and Host Templates with a title or name containing malicious JavaScript code

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Execution of actions on behalf of the victim
    - Potentially gaining access to other sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the web interface of Cacti.
- An attacker would need to create or modify Cacti objects (Graph Tree, CDEF, Data Source, Graph, Data Input Method, Graph Template, Host Template) and inject malicious JavaScript code in the title or name fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker requires console access to create these items, but does not need full administrator privileges.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit these objects within the Cacti system.

**Additional details:**
* This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2014-5025, which concerns XSS during data source editing.
* The vulnerability is also distinct from CVE-2014-5043, which is an XSS in the "System Utilities - View User Log" page when a user with a malicious Full Name has logged in.
* The vulnerability is fixed in Cacti version 0.8.8c (and above)

**Summary**

CVE-2014-5026 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cacti due to a lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker with console access to inject malicious Javascript by creating or editing certain objects (Graph Trees, CDEFs, Data Sources, Graphs, Data Input Methods, Graph Templates, and Host Templates) with crafted titles or names. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code within other users browsers.
