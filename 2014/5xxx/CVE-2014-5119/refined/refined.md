Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-5119:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error in the `__gconv_translit_find()` function within the glibc library. This function is responsible for loading transliteration modules, and the vulnerability occurs during the construction of the filename for these modules.  The code incorrectly calculates the memory required, resulting in a buffer overflow. Specifically, the code uses `__mempcpy` and `memcpy` to append ".so" after the name, with a single NUL byte is written past the end of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The off-by-one error allows writing a single null byte beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- **Missing length check:** The `memcpy` operation does not properly check for the available buffer size leading to the overflow
- Broken `need_so` logic in `gconv_trans`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  Attackers with the ability to control the character set argument passed to the `iconv_open()` function can trigger a heap overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable function.
- **System compromise:** In a setuid application, an exploit can lead to privilege escalation to root.
- **Crash:** In some circumstances, exploiting the vulnerability can crash an application due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local exploit:** An attacker needs to be able to run unprivileged arbitrary code on the local system.
- **Environment variable manipulation**: The vulnerability can be triggered by using a specially crafted destination character set argument, such as those supplied via the `CHARSET` or related environment variables. The `CHARSETALIASDIR` environment variable can be used to define aliases to control the libraries loaded by `iconv_open`.
- Malicious locale name values in LC\_\* environment variables can lead to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have some level of access to the target system where they can execute code.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker has to be able to trigger a call to `iconv_open()` within the application code.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects 32-bit architectures more readily due to ASLR limitations, however, other systems may be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability lies in the `iconv/gconv_trans.c` source file within glibc.
- Several public proof-of-concept exploits are available, targeting specific distributions and architectures.
- The vulnerability is present in the `__gconv_translit_find()` and `iconv_open()` functions.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a program processes a crafted locale name.
- The fix involves disabling loadable gconv transliteration modules as the code was defective and never fully functional.
- Patches often remove the vulnerable `__gconv_translit_find` functionality.
