- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pyxis SupplyStation system contains debugging files and other developer files which may expose system vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file handling, specifically the presence of debugging and developer files that can reveal information about application source code and system vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of application source code and system vulnerabilities could lead to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the Pyxis SupplyStation system.
