  "CVE-2014-5353": {
    "description": "The krb5_ldap_get_password_policy_from_dn function in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_pwd_policy.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.13.1, when the KDC uses LDAP, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a successful LDAP query with no results, as demonstrated by using an incorrect object type for a password policy.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `krb5_ldap_get_password_policy_from_dn` function, which incorrectly processes LDAP queries that return no results. Instead of returning an error, the function creates a zeroed-out password policy object. When the code attempts to access the policy name, it dereferences a NULL pointer, resulting in a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of LDAP queries with no results",
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker can cause the KDC (Key Distribution Center) to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker must be able to authenticate with the KDC and have the elevated privileges to set password policies for principals"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have administrative access to modify password policies."
