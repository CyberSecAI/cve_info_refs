# [Review Board 1.7.27 and 2.0.4 security releases](/news/2014/07/22/review-board-1-7-27-and-2-0-3-security-releases/)

## July 22, 2014

We have two new Review Board releases for you tonight. Both fix a couple security vulnerabilities that came to our attention, as well as several other bugs. There are also a few new feature additions.

One of the security vulnerabilities allowed an attacker to construct a URL that would inject custom JavaScript into the page, which could then be passed to a user, allowing the custom code to run in their session.

The other vulnerability allowed users without access to a private review request to construct a URL for accessing original or patched files from the repository, if they knew the right series of database IDs.

Feature-wise, 1.7.27 gained a few of the recent additions to review UIs, support pages, and API that were introduced in 2.0.3.

2.0.4 gained support for uploading parent diffs in the New Review Request page.

If you're upgrading to 1.7.27, you'll need to run:

```
sudo easy_install ReviewBoard==1.7.27

```

For the full list of changes, see the [1.7.27](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/1.7.27/) and [2.0.4](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/2.0.4/) release notes.

Keep up with the latest Review Board releases, security updates, and
helpful information.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Review Board 1.7.27 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-1-7-27-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: July 22, 2014

## Security Updates[¶](#security-updates "Permalink to this heading")

This release fixes a couple of security vulnerabilities that came to our
attention.

We strongly recommend that everyone upgrade to this release.

* Fixed a vulnerability where a URL to a diff fragment could be crafted that
  would inject custom HTML into the page. An attacker could send such a URL
  to another user and execute code in their browser session.

  This was reported by Uchida. A CVE number is pending.
* The Original File and Patched File resources could be used to access files
  on a private review request that the user did not have access to, if they
  knew the approciate database IDs.

  A CVE number is pending.

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")

* Added a new Company/Organization setting in General Settings.

  This can be used to specify the company or organization that owns the
  server. It will be displayed when the user visits the support page.

  This field is optional.
* Added a setting for controlling whether support usage statistics are sent
  to us.

  We use these statistics to help us diagnose common trends in support
  problems, to help prioritize supported platforms and versions, and to
  provide better support pages when a particular install’s users click
  Get Support. This data is never provided in any form to
  anybody but the core developers of Review Board.

  This can be toggled in the Support Settings page. New sites will be
  prompted during install by **rb-site install**.

## Extensions[¶](#extensions "Permalink to this heading")

### Review UIs[¶](#review-uis "Permalink to this heading")

* `ReviewUI` subclasses can now selectively be enabled or disabled
  for specific file attachments.

  A `ReviewUI` subclass can now implement `is_enabled_for()`
  to determine whether it should be enabled for a given file attachment,
  depending on the attachment, review request, or user.

## Web API[¶](#web-api "Permalink to this heading")

* Creating or updating a review request using an empty change number will
  now properly show the Empty Changeset error response.

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed the URL to the Recaptcha registration page. ([Bug #3471](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3471))
* The per-user option for choosing whether to receive e-mail is now properly
  shown in the My Account page.
* Fixed review request counters in the dashboard getting out of sync with
  reality. ([Bug #2268](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/2268))
* The All Review Requests and User pages no longer break if the user doesn’t
  yet have a profile set up. ([Bug #3083](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3083))
* Fixed review request breakages when posting changes on a Local Site with
  an invalid Perforce/Plastic change number.
* Fixed various breakages when referring to users on a public Local Site
  that aren’t members of the site. ([Bug #3484](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3484))

Use CVE-2014-5027.

Use CVE-2014-5028.

(Incidentally, we're not sure whether the original request sent July 21
was within the oss-security list charter. MITRE does not control the list
charter, but

  <http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security>

says "List Content Guidelines ... Public security issues only please"
whereas the original request said "two security vulnerabilities ...
Neither are publicly disclosed." If you want a CVE ID for an
undisclosed vulnerability in the future -- for example, because you
want to include the CVE ID number when the
<https://www.reviewboard.org/news/> entry first becomes public -- there
are other options, such as sending the CVE request directly to
cve-assign () mitre org instead.)

# Review Board 2.0.4 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-2-0-4-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: July 22, 2014

## Security Updates[¶](#security-updates "Permalink to this heading")

This release fixes a couple of security vulnerabilities that came to our
attention. These have not been publicly disclosed.

* Fixed a vulnerability where a URL to a diff fragment could be crafted that
  would inject custom HTML into the page. An attacker could send such a URL
  to another user and execute code in their browser session.

  This was reported by Uchida. A CVE number is pending.
* The Original File and Patched File resources could be used to access files
  on a private review request that the user did not have access to, if they
  knew the approciate database IDs.

  A CVE number is pending.

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")

* Added support for parent diffs in the New Review Request page.

  When uploading a diff, Review Board will now detect if a parent diff is
  needed for the patch to apply. If so, the user will be shown an appropriate
  error and then shown fields for uploading a parent diff.

## Localization[¶](#localization "Permalink to this heading")

* Updated the Italian translations.

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed the URL to the Recaptcha registration page. ([Bug #3471](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3471))
* Fixed the command line used for `update_index` in the example crontab.

### Review Requests[¶](#review-requests "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed the display of errors when failing to publish a draft review
  request.

  Patch by Mark Côté.
* When uploading file attachments, malformed mimetypes provided by the
  browser will be ignored, and a proper mimetype will be guessed.
  ([Bug #3427](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3427))
* Long strings in the right-hand review request fields no longer cause
  fields to overlap. ([Bug #3371](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3371))
* Fixed the display of errors in the Upload Diff and Add File dialogs.
  ([Bug #3413](https://www.reviewboard.org/bugs/3413))

### Subversion[¶](#subversion "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed a Unicode compatibility issue when fetching files using PySVN.

## Contributors[¶](#contributors "Permalink to this heading")

* Christian Hammond
* David Trowbridge
* Mark Côté

# CVE requests for Review Board

---

*From*: Christian Hammond <christian () beanbaginc com>

Hi,

We have two security vulnerabilities that were just discovered, which both need CVEs assigned. This is for Review Board
(<https://www.reviewboard.org>). Neither are publicly disclosed.

The first was discovered in-house and applies to all Review Board 1.7.x and 2.0.x releases. It allows a user without
access to a private review request to retrieve the original or patched files associated with that review request
through the API, if they know all the relevant database IDs.

The second was discovered by “Uchida.” It allows a user to compose a URL to a rendered section of a diff on Review
Board and inject HTML through a query parameter. That URL could then be handed to another user (most likely embedded in
an iframe in another page), allowing a custom script to be executed on their behalf. This also applies to both 1.7.x
and 2.0.x.

Our plan is to get a release out with fixes for these sometime today/tonight.

Thanks,

Christian
