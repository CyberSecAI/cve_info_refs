Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in XRMS, specifically within the `fingeruser.php` script. This occurs when the `username` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization in the `username` parameter of the `fingeruser.php` script, allowing command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can achieve RCE by injecting commands that will be executed on the server. This can allow the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request: An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `fingeruser.php` script with a malicious payload within the `username` parameter. The exploit code utilizes `urllib.urlencode` to encode the injected commands in the username parameter.
- Session Poisoning:  Although not directly related to CVE-2014-5521, the exploit utilizes an earlier SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-5520) to obtain admin credentials. These credentials are used to authenticate, before executing the command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable XRMS application.
- Authentication: Requires administrator credentials to exploit this specific command injection vulnerability. These are obtained using an SQLi exploit, but are needed for the command injection.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter: The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint (`fingeruser.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`username`).

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the attack by:
    - First, exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve administrator credentials.
    - Then, using the retrieved credentials to authenticate.
    - After authentication, sending a crafted request to the `fingeruser.php` script with an injected command in the `username` parameter using the following structure:
    ```
    cmd = urllib.urlencode([("; echo '0x41';" + command + ";echo '14x0';",None)])
	url = 'http://'+domain+'/plugins/useradmin/fingeruser.php?username=' + cmd
    ```
    - The injected command is delimited by `echo '0x41'` and `echo '14x0'` to extract the output from the response

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code provided at exploit-db.com combines both the SQL injection (CVE-2014-5520) and command injection (CVE-2014-5521) vulnerabilities.
- This vulnerability is in the XRMS CRM suite, which uses PHP, ADOdb, and LAMP stack.
- The vulnerability was reportedly present in the latest version at the time of the report (August 2014).
