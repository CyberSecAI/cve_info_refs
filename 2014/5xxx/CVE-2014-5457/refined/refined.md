The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5457.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an improperly configured file system permission. The `/etc/shadow` file, which contains user password hashes, is world-readable. This is achieved via a symbolic link from `/etc/shadow` to `config/shadow` which has permissions set to `-rw-r--r--`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the world-readable permission on the shadow file (config/shadow), which should only be accessible by the root user. Additionally, the shadow file contains MD5 hashes without salt.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read the shadow file and obtain user password hashes. These hashes can then be cracked, leading to unauthorized access to the device.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with local access to the system can directly read the shadow file. It should be noted that this vulnerability is also exploitable by remote attackers if other vulnerabilities allow for code execution or remote file access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires local access to the device's file system to read the world-readable shadow file. The attacker could also potentially exploit this through an existing vulnerability in the system allowing remote access or file access.
