Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2014-5359
* **Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal
* **Affected Product:** SafeNet SAS Outlook Web Access Agent (formerly CRYPTOCard), all versions up to and including 1.03.20091
* **Root Cause:** The `GetFile` parameter in the OWA Agent does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing directory traversal characters (e.g., `..%5C`).
* **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation of the `GetFile` parameter.
* **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `GetFile` parameter in the URL to the vulnerable OWA agent. For example: `https://url/owa/owa?Application=Exchange&GetFile=..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5Cboot.ini`
* **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
* **Impact:**
    *   Read arbitrary files from the webserver's file system.
    *   Access sensitive files such as IIS server logs and configuration files (potentially containing database connection strings), Windows configuration files, and SAS configuration files including the Agent Encryption Key and log files.
*   **Vendor Response:** A patch (SAS OWA Agent build 1.03.30109) was released to address the vulnerability.
