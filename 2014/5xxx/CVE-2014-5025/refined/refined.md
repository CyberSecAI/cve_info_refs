Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-5025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the Cacti application when creating or editing data sources. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the "Name" or "Title" field of a data source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the data source name or title fields. When a user views or interacts with these modified data sources, the injected script executes within their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user. This could range from hijacking a user's session, to defacing the Cacti interface, or potentially gaining further access to the system depending on the user's privileges and the complexity of the malicious payload.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the Cacti web interface itself.
*   An attacker needs to have the capability to create or edit data sources within Cacti to inject the malicious code.
*   The attack occurs when another user views or interacts with the infected data source entry

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have some level of authenticated access to Cacti to create or edit data sources. The required level of access is not specified in this context, but it is implied it's not full administrative.
*   The attacker must have the ability to create or edit data sources within cacti which can be achieved with "console access" and not necessarily full administrator privileges.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in Cacti version 0.8.8c.
*   The XSS vulnerability is triggered when trying to perform actions on an infected data source, like "Delete, Change data template, Change Host, Enable...".
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2014-5026, which involves similar XSS issues in other parts of the Cacti application.
