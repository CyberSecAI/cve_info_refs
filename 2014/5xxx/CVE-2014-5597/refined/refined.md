{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates.",
      "Failure to validate the SSL/TLS chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can potentially view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by an attacker on the same network as the affected Android device.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's device, or able to intercept network traffic (e.g. public WiFi)."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_applications_count": "23667 out of 1000462 tested Android applications failed dynamic SSL validation testing.",
    "testing_methodology": "CERT Tapioca was used to test applications, as described in the CERT/CC blog.",
    "solution_recommendations": [
      "Apply updates to affected applications.",
      "Avoid using affected applications if the content is available through other means (e.g., web browser).",
      "Avoid untrusted networks, such as public WiFi."
    ],
    "vendor_notification": "Multiple vendors of Android application stores were notified about the testing and results, recommending similar testing for application suitability in their stores."
