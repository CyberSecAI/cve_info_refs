  "CVE-2014-5091": {
    "description": "This entry corresponds to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to the presence of an `eval()` backdoor in the `/includes/functions.php` file of the Status2k Server Monitoring Software. The vulnerable code is `eval($_GET['multies']);`.",
    "root_cause": "The application directly evaluates user-supplied input from the `multies` GET parameter using the `eval()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated input leading to code injection",
      "Use of `eval()` with untrusted input"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/includes/functions.php` with the `multies` parameter containing malicious PHP code.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
