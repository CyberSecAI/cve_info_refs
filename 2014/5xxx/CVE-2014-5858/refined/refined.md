The provided content describes a vulnerability related to improper SSL certificate validation in multiple Android applications, which aligns with the description for CVE-2014-5858.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the failure of Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** Applications do not correctly verify the SSL chain, failing to ensure the certificate was issued by a trusted CA.
- **Lack of Secure Communication:** This vulnerability undermines the security of HTTPS connections, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially manipulate data meant to be protected by SSL/TLS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Attackers on the same network can intercept and modify network traffic meant to be secured by HTTPS.
- **Credential Stealing:** Attackers can potentially steal user credentials.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, successful MITM attacks could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.
- The specific impact depends on the application and the data it transmits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can include public Wi-Fi networks or any network where the attacker can intercept traffic.
- The attacker needs the ability to perform a MITM attack, intercepting and potentially modifying the network traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using CERT Tapioca.
- A spreadsheet is maintained to track affected applications, versions, and fixes.
- The issue was publicly known as early as 2012.
- The vulnerability is tracked under VU#582497 by CERT.
- The content references two FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar issues.
