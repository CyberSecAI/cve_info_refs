{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS communication."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the affected Android device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
     "additional_information":"The vulnerability note references a spreadsheet that contains a list of affected applications, and provides a testing methodology using CERT Tapioca. The note also mentions that the Federal Trade Commission has settled charges with vendors for failing to securely transmit sensitive information. It was also reported that over 23,000 applications failed dynamic SSL validation testing out of over 1,000,000 tested apps."
