Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE ID:** Not specified in the advisory, but related to Drupal core issues fixed in SA-CORE-2014-003.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple security issues were discovered. The advisory mentions vulnerabilities ranging from denial of service to cross-site scripting. The specific causes for each vulnerability are not detailed in this advisory. Further details can be found in the linked Drupal security advisory (https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-003).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   DoS attacks could render the affected Drupal site unavailable.
*   XSS vulnerabilities could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:

    *   Defacing the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious activities on behalf of a user

**Attack Vectors:**  The advisory doesn't specify the exact attack vectors for each vulnerability but implies they are web-based attacks. XSS attacks are typically carried out by injecting malicious code into web pages, while DoS attacks can be launched through various methods that overwhelm the server or application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to send malicious requests or inject code into the application.
*   Specific requirements to exploit these vulnerabilities are not available in this advisory, but web application knowledge and access to the Drupal application would likely be required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This advisory provides information that Drupal 7 was vulnerable to multiple issues that can lead to denial of service and cross-site scripting
*   The advisory directs users to the Drupal security advisory for more information, suggesting the official Drupal announcement would have further technical details.
