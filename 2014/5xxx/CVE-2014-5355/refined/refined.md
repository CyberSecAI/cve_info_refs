{
  "CVE-2014-5355": {
    "Description": "MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.13.1 incorrectly expects that a krb5_read_message data field is represented as a string ending with a '\\0' character, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a zero-byte version string or (2) cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) by omitting the '\\0' character, related to appl/user_user/server.c and lib/krb5/krb/recvauth.c.",
    "Root cause": "The `krb5_read_message` function in MIT Kerberos does not ensure that the data it reads from the client is a null-terminated string before passing it to string manipulation functions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service. The server process crashes.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a zero-byte version string",
       "Sending a non-null-terminated version string."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted network message to a vulnerable server."
  }
