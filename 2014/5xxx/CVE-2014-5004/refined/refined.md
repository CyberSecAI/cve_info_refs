Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `brbackup` Ruby gem's practice of constructing a command line string for executing MySQL commands that includes the database password. Specifically, the `password_option` method constructs a string that can expose the password when used in a system call to the mysql client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Password Exposure in Process Table:** The `password_option` method in `brbackup-0.1.1/lib/brbackup.rb` generates a MySQL command line option `-p'#{dbpass}'` which, when executed using `system` or `%x{}`, will expose the password in the process table. This means that any user on the system with the ability to see running processes can view the database password.
2. **Command Injection:** While not explicitly assigned a CVE, the advisory mentions that command injection is possible if a user supplies malicious input to the `dbuser` variable.
3.  **SQL Injection:** While initially flagged, it was determined that the `name` variable was not user-supplied and thus the SQL injection risk was not exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the database password by viewing the process list.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** If the database user has elevated privileges, obtaining the password allows an attacker to gain those privileges.
*   **Command Injection:** A malicious user can inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `dbuser` variable or other injectable variables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Any user on the system who can view process lists can obtain the password.
*   **Command Injection:** If a user-controlled variable is used in the construction of the command that is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** An attacker needs local system access to view process lists (e.g., using tools like `ps` or `top`).
*   **Command Injection:** The attacker must be able to control inputs for `dbuser` or other variables used in shell commands.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory notes the gem author was contacted and the issue was marked as WONTFIX.
*   The advisory also references OSVDB IDs 108899, 108900, and 108901.
