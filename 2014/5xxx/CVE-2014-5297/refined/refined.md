```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses the `unserialize()` function on user-controlled data from the "report" POST parameter without proper sanitization. The data is also base64 decoded before being passed to the `unserialize` function.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: PHP Object Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary PHP objects can be injected into the application scope, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and other attacks.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/protected/controllers/SiteController.php` endpoint with a base64-encoded serialized PHP object in the `report` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected endpoint. No authentication or specific positioning is mentioned.
