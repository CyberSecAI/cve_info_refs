Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5393:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Path Traversal** (also known as Directory Traversal) issue. This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied file names or paths, allowing attackers to navigate outside of the intended webroot directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The JobScheduler web interface does not adequately validate user-supplied input when handling file paths. This allows special characters (e.g., `../`) to be passed through to the operating system's file system API.
*   **Access Control Bypass:**  An unprivileged user with "info" permission can exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can list directories and read the contents of sensitive files located within the JobScheduler web interface installation. This can include:
    *   Datasource configurations (e.g., `hibernate.cfg.xml` and `sos_settings.ini`), which might contain database passwords.
    *   Permission configuration files (`scheduler.xml`), potentially containing credentials for the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could potentially be used to escalate from "info" to "all" permissions, giving an attacker greater control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the JobScheduler web interface containing path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the JobScheduler web interface.
*   **User Account (Low-Privilege):** An attacker needs a user account with at least "info" permission to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Versions of JobScheduler prior to 1.7.4241
*   Versions of JobScheduler prior to 1.6.4246.

**Patched Versions:**

*   1.6.4246
*   1.7.2 (1.7.4241)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-219: "Path Traversal to Sensitive Files in Webroot".
*   The advisory mentions that no concrete exploit code will be presented due to a responsible disclosure process.
*   The wikipedia article provides a more general explanation of directory traversal attacks
