Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect default file permissions assigned to the temporary directories used by Zarafa WebAccess and WebApp. Specifically, the directories `/var/lib/zarafa-webaccess/tmp/` and `/var/lib/zarafa-webapp/tmp/` are created with read and write permissions for the Apache system user, and are also world-readable (e.g., 755 permissions on RHEL). Files created within these directories, such as uploaded email attachments, also have world-readable permissions (644).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file permissions (755 for the directory and 644 for files within) that allows any local system user to read the temporary files.
- **Information Disclosure:** Temporary session data, including uploaded email attachments, are exposed due to the world-readable permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** A local attacker can read sensitive information within the temporary directories, including uploaded email attachments.
- **Data Exposure:**  The contents of temporary session files can be accessed by unauthorized local users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have local system access to the server running Zarafa WebAccess or WebApp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where Zarafa is installed.
- **No Elevated Privileges:** No elevated privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. Any local user can read the exposed files.

**Additional Notes:**

- This CVE specifically addresses the permission issue, not the data or content of the files that are exposed.
- The vulnerability affects both Zarafa WebAccess and Zarafa WebApp.
- The issue is caused by a design choice that was copied into both products with their own path conventions.
- The problem was fixed by updating the permission of these directories to prevent unauthorized access.
