The provided content is related to CVE-2014-5438.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious script code into the web interface of the Arris TG862G modem/router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities are present in the web interface of the Arris TG862G/CT modem/router.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web interface.
- **CSRF:** The content mentions that the tested version is also vulnerable to CSRF, though details of the CSRF vulnerability are not provided.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by an authenticated administrator, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in their browser. This could allow the attacker to hijack the admin's session, steal cookies, or perform actions on their behalf.
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject persistent JavaScript code into the router's configuration. This code would then execute each time the administrator visits the page containing the injected payload, allowing for persistent control over the router's web interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code, specifically through the `computer_name` parameter in `connected_devices_computers_edit.php`.
- **Stored XSS:** The attack vector is through a POST request to `managed_sites_add_keyword.php` containing malicious JavaScript code in the `keyword` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link (for reflected XSS) or exploit a CSRF vulnerability to inject the stored XSS payload.
- In the case of stored XSS, an attacker would need authenticated access, however, this could be gained through a prior CSRF or reflected XSS attack.
