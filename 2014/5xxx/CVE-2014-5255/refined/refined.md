{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-5255",
  "description": "xcfa before 5.0.1 creates temporary files insecurely which could allow local users to launch a symlink attack and overwrite arbitrary files. Note: A different vulnerability than CVE-2014-5254.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Insecure creation of temporary files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application creates a temporary file in a shared directory (/tmp) without proper security measures.",
        "The application uses a predictable file name for the temporary file.",
        "The application does not properly handle symlinks, potentially overwriting arbitrary files."
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files.",
       "attackVectors": [
          "A local attacker can create a symlink in /tmp with the same name as the temporary file, which will be removed/overwritten by the vulnerable application."
        ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs local access to the system."
    },
    {
      "rootCause": "Insecure temporary file creation combined with command execution.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "The application creates and executes a temporary shell script in /tmp.",
          "The application does not properly sanitize the content of the shell script, allowing for injection of malicious code.",
           "The application does not create the temporary file with secure permissions, allowing the attacker to write arbitrary shell code into the temp file before chmod is executed."
         ],
      "impact": "A local user can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system by injecting malicious code into the temporary shell script.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "A local attacker can create a file with the same name as the temporary script, with 0777 permissions, which would allow the attacker to write shell code into it between the fclose and system calls"
      ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs local access to the system."
