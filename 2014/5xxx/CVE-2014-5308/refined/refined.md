```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerabilities in two different locations of the application.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes.
  - Attack vectors: HTTP POST requests to specific URLs, injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable parameters.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have an account on the application. The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user, including newly created guest users.
