Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of external entities in XML-RPC messages processed by the Netconf service in Opendaylight. Specifically, the service processes external entities referenced in XML messages without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **External Entity Injection (XXE):** The core vulnerability is an XXE flaw, where the application parses XML input that includes references to external entities (both local and remote).
*   **Local and Remote File Inclusion:**  Due to the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can include local files from the server’s filesystem (local file inclusion) or remote files from external URLs (remote file inclusion).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can use the vulnerability to read any file on the server accessible by the Opendaylight process.
*  **Disclosure of hashed system credentials:** This can allow an attacker to perform offline password attacks, potentially leading to eventual disclosure of clear-text system credentials.
*   **Access to shadow file:**  An attacker can extract the shadow file and perform offline password attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Service (Netconf):** The attack vector is the Netconf service, which uses TCP.
*   **XML-RPC Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted XML-RPC messages containing external entity references to the Netconf service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Opendaylight instance's Netconf service (TCP).
*   **Ability to send crafted XML-RPC Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send XML-RPC messages to the service containing the malicious external entity references.
* **No authentication required** Based on the description, it doesn't seem that authentication is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Opendaylight 1.0 (Hydrogen) – Base, Virtualization, and Service Provider Editions.
* The Opendaylight service runs with root credentials making the impact more severe
* The vulnerability was reported by Gregory Pickett (@shogun7273) of Hellfire Security.
