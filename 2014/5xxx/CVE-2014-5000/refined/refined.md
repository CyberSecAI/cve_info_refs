Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-5000:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `lawn-login` Ruby gem's improper handling of user-supplied passwords. Specifically, the `login` function in `lib/lawn.rb` uses string interpolation to construct a `curl` command. The password, passed as an argument to the function, is directly embedded into this command without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Password Exposure in Process Table:** The primary weakness is that the password is exposed to the process table via the command-line arguments of the `curl` process. This means that any user with the ability to view process information on the system can potentially discover the password in clear text.
*   **Potential Command Injection:** If the `lawn-login` gem is used within a context where the `username` or `password` parameters are derived from external (potentially malicious) input, it's possible to inject shell commands into the `curl` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can obtain the password by monitoring process lists, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the associated account or system.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Through command injection, attackers may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Process Monitoring:** A local user or process that can read process information can easily discover the password.
*   **Remote Command Injection:** If the gem is used in a context where user input flows into the username or password parameters, an attacker can inject shell commands via these parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access for Process Monitoring:** To discover passwords through process table inspection, the attacker needs at least local access to the system or the ability to monitor process data.
*   **Ability to Inject Input:** For remote command injection, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate input parameters of the application that uses the vulnerable gem. This could be through HTTP request parameters or other similar methods.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `lawn-login-0.0.7`, specifically in the `lib/lawn.rb` file, line 24.
*   The advisory from `vapid.dhs.org` confirms the vulnerability and provides additional context.
*   The reported OSVDB ID is 108576.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is: `curl -s -f -F username=\#{username}\ -F password=\#{password}\ -F iss=\false\ -F output=\binary\ <https://auth.lawn.gatech.edu/index.php>`
