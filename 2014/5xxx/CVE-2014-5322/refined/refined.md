The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the "Instant Web Publishing" feature of FileMaker Pro.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing data through the "Instant Web Publishing" feature, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript within a user's web browser when they interact with the vulnerable FileMaker Pro application via "Instant Web Publishing."

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack can be carried out over the network, using packets.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious script (e.g., clicking a link or viewing a specially crafted file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the FileMaker Pro application.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to induce user interaction with the crafted malicious link/file to trigger the exploit.
- No Authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected Products: FileMaker Pro versions 12 and earlier, as well as FileMaker Pro Advanced versions 12 and earlier are vulnerable. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 13 and later of both products.
