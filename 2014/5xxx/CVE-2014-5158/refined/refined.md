Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2014-5158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data before executing a command within the `ossim-framework` service and `av-centerd` SOAP service of AlienVault OSSIM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with root privileges. This grants the attacker complete control over the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, which means an attacker can target vulnerable systems directly from the internet or an adjacent network.
