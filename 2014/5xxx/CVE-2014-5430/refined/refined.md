- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path element. An executable file within ABB RobotStudio and Test Signal Viewer attempts to load DLL files dynamically from a third-party component. During this process, the application can be tricked into loading a malicious DLL from an untrusted source if it exists in the search path. The vulnerable executable was mistakenly included in the distribution but not used in the normal operation of the software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of an uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427). The affected applications are vulnerable to DLL hijacking because they do not specify the exact paths for the DLLs they attempt to load, instead relying on the system's search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. The exploit is triggered when a user runs a vulnerable application, which can then be made to load a malicious DLL from an untrusted source.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location that is part of the applicationâ€™s DLL search path. The attacker would also need to have the user execute the vulnerable application locally.
