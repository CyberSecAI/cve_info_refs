Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5269:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `Plack::App::File` handles trailing slashes in file paths. Specifically, the `split` function used to parse the path did not include the `-1` argument. This caused the function to ignore any empty trailing fields which effectively pruned trailing slashes from the requested path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Canonicalization Issue:** `Plack::App::File` incorrectly canonicalized file paths by stripping trailing slashes, thus treating `/file.txt.pl` and `/file.txt.pl/` as the same file.
- **Bypass of File Handling Logic:** This behavior could be exploited to bypass security checks that rely on specific file extensions, leading to the unintended serving of static files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Exposure/Information Disclosure:** By adding trailing slashes to the end of a file path, an attacker could bypass application logic that was intended to process a specific file type (e.g. a `.txt.pl` file which was meant to be processed by perl) and instead directly access the raw file content via `Plack::Middleware::Static`. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive code or configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the URL of an HTTP request by appending trailing slashes to a file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a server using `Plack::App::File` and `Plack::Middleware::Static`, and with an application that uses a combination of file handling logic and static file serving.

**Summary:**
The core issue is the incorrect usage of `split` in `Plack::App::File`, leading to unintended stripping of trailing slashes and thus the ability to bypass file extension based filtering and server raw static files that would have been otherwise processed by application code. This issue is a bypass vulnerability rather than a traditional path traversal as it does not allow access to files outside the webroot. The fix involved ensuring that trailing slashes are not pruned during path processing by including the `-1` argument in the split function.
