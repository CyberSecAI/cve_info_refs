The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5649.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This occurs because the applications do not verify that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack through network interception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
