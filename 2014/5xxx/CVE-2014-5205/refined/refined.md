Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way WordPress was building and verifying CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens. Specifically, the individual pieces of the token (action, user ID) were not being separated by a delimiter when generating the hash. This allowed for potential collisions where different combinations of action and user ID could result in the same hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Delimiters:** The primary weakness was the absence of delimiters when concatenating the action and user ID before hashing. This made it easier to create a valid hash with incorrect input values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF Token Bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass CSRF protections by crafting requests with manipulated action and user ID values that still produce a valid-looking nonce, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attacks:** The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action by submitting a crafted form, link, or other request that contains the forged nonce.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into making a request. This usually means the user has to click on a malicious link or submit a form.
*   **Knowledge of the WordPress Installation:** An attacker would need a basic understanding of how WordPress generates and uses CSRF tokens to craft the malicious request.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability was fixed in the following commits

*   [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29408](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29408)

This commit added delimiters when building nonce hashes.
```
- $expected = substr( wp_hash( $i . '|' . $action . '|' . $uid~~. '|' . $token~~, 'nonce'), -12, 10 );
+ $expected = substr( wp_hash( $i . '|' . $action . '|' . $uid, 'nonce'), -12, 10 );
```
```
- return substr(wp_hash($i . ~~action~~ . $uid, 'nonce'), -12, 10);
+ return substr(wp_hash($i . '|' . $action . '|' . $uid, 'nonce'), -12, 10);
```
*   [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29384](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29384)
This commit introduced constant time comparison for nonces via `hash_equals()` function, mitigating timing attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions 2.0.3 to 3.9.1 (excluding 3.7.4 and 3.8.4).
*   This was addressed as part of the WordPress 3.9.2 security release.
