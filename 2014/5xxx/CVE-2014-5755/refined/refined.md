  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL certificate chain when communicating over HTTPS."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",

      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on a network where the Android device is connected."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. No special capabilities are explicitly mentioned but the attacker would need the ability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic."
