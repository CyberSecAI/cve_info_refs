Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an unsafe serialization process when handling widgets in WordPress. Specifically, the code was not adequately verifying the integrity of serialized widget data, potentially allowing for manipulation before unserialization. This is related to the `WP_Customize_Widgets` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsafe Serialization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper verification of serialized widget data.  The `get_instance_hash_key` function was initially using `md5( AUTH_KEY . serialize( $instance ) )` which was deemed insufficient. This was changed to use `wp_hash( $serialized_instance )` which provides a more secure MAC (Message Authentication Code).
- **Tampering of Data:**  Serialized widget data could potentially be tampered with during transit, leading to the execution of malicious code upon unserialization on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:**  A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted, serialized widget data. Although, the security advisory states that "WordPress is not affected by default", this suggests some conditions would need to be met for the exploit to work, which are not described.
- **Compromise of System:** Remote code execution can lead to a full compromise of the affected WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated Widget Data:** An attacker would need to intercept and modify the serialized widget data that is passed between the client (browser) and the server, specifically the encoded serialized instance and the instance hash key.
- **Customizer Interface:** The vulnerability is related to how WordPress handles widget data within the Customizer interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Intercept Data:** The attacker would need the ability to intercept the communication between the client and server, where the serialized widget data is exchanged. This could be via a man-in-the-middle attack or another form of network access.
- **Knowledge of the System:** An attacker would also need some knowledge of how WordPress serializes widget data.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves verifying the MAC of the serialized widget instance early in the process, before unserializing it.
- The changeset `29389`  addresses this issue by changing `get_instance_hash_key` to use `wp_hash()` instead of using `md5` with the `AUTH_KEY`, and the check was moved earlier in the process.
- The vulnerability affects WordPress versions 3.9 and 3.9.1
- The vulnerability was discovered by Alex Concha of the WordPress security team.
- The provided content provides more specific technical details than the original CVE description, detailing how the `get_instance_hash_key` method was changed and how the serialized data was checked.
