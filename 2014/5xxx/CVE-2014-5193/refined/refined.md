Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-5193 and others mentioned in the document related to Sphider Search Engine 1.3.6:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input in the filter option of the "Sites -> Browser pages" section.
    *   **Weakness:** Failure to properly validate and sanitize user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with malicious SQL in the `filter` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL syntax.

2.  **PHP Code Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of configuration settings, allowing an authenticated user to inject PHP code.
    *   **Weakness:** Allowing the user to modify configuration parameters, and not sanitizing or escaping the input leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server takeover. An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, gaining full control.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with PHP code embedded in configuration settings, then sending a HTTP POST request to `/sphider/settings/conf.php` with the 'cmd' parameter
    *  **Required Capabilities:**  Attacker needs to be a valid user of the application to change the configuration settings.
        * The content also notes that in v1.3.5, authentication can be bypassed

3.  **Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input sanitization and output encoding, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Weakness:** Not properly sanitizing user-provided data before rendering it in HTML.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions on other users.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Stored XSS:** Sending a POST request to `/admin/admin.php` with a malicious script in the `category` parameter.
        *   **Reflected XSS:** Sending a POST request to `/sphider/admin/admin.php` with a malicious script in the `url` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
