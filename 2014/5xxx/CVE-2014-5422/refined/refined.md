- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pyxis SupplyStation system contains a hard-coded service password that grants administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a hard-coded password (CWE-259).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker, who has bypassed network/physical security, could compromise the system. With physical access to the system, an attacker could remove medical supplies.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if network and physical security are bypassed. Physical access to the device is required to remove contents.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to bypass network and/or physical security of the facility where the SupplyStation system is deployed. Physical access is also needed to remove medical supplies.
