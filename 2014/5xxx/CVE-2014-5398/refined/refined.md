{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in Schneider Electric Wonderware Information Server (WIS) when parsing XML external entities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software does not properly validate or sanitize XML external entities, allowing for the possibility of XML external entity (XXE) injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially access local resources (files and internal resources) or cause a denial of service. Contents of local remote resources can be sent to the attacker's server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious XML files. The vulnerability is triggered when a local user loads these malformed XML files within the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a local user to run the vulnerable application and load the crafted XML files. Remote exploitation is not possible."
