- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pyxis SupplyStation system uses a hard-coded non-privileged application account password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain limited system access to application files that run the automated supply cabinet and manipulate the locking controls on the cabinet to remove its contents.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required for remote exploitation, with a valid, but non-privileged, account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access and knowledge of the hard-coded, non-privileged application account credentials.
