The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5819.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation is done by intercepting and manipulating network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server. This can be achieved by being on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using CERT Tapioca.
- A spreadsheet (available in the document) lists affected applications and libraries.
- The document also mentions that the Federal Trade Commission has taken action against vendors for similar issues.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-296 (Improper Handling of Certificates).
