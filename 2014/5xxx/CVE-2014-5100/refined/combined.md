[v3.1](/omeka/Omeka/releases/tag/v3.1)

Omeka Classic 3.1 is a feature update to the 3.x version series.

This release adds compatibility for PHP 8.1 and 8.2, and the minimum PHP requirement is now increased to 5.6.

## Improvements

* Added descriptive text for "Show Empty Elements" and "Show Element Set Headings" apperance settings (contributed by [@luku](https://github.com/luku))
* Improved admin theme behavior at narrower screen widths
* Various accessibility improvements to admin and public views

## Fixes

* Fixed admin styling for `<select multiple>` ([#968](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/968))
* Fixed default markup for `<input type="radio">` in forms ([#970](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/970))
* Fixed admin styling for "save group" form elements ([#981](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/981))
* Fixed ImageMagick creating inverted-color thumbnails for CMYK PDFs (must have ImageMagick 6.7.5-1 or newer, and set `version` strategy option accordingly for fix to be applied)
* Fixed issues with emails being sent improperly on PHP 8+
* Fixed Zend\_Ldap not working on PHP 8+

## Changes

* Passing an empty/blank `id` to form elements and helpers will omit the ID entirely, not output `id=""` ([#701](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/701))

## For Developers

### REST API

* Allowed `advanced` query for items in the API (contributed by [@mw0000](https://github.com/mw0000))

* Added functions `record_image_url`, `queue_lightgallery_assets`, `lightgallery`, `lightgallery_other_files`
* Added view helper `lightGallery`

* Berlin theme updated to 2.7.3

* tag\_attributes now accepts int and float values instead of stripping them ([#921](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/pull/921))

## Features

* PHP 7.3 compatibility
* Version notifications for new releases of plugins and themes

* New `forceSSL` option for ZendS3 storage adapter to force use of `https:` addresses for file URLs ([#877](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/pull/877), contributed by [@ebellempire](https://github.com/ebellempire))
* `mail.force_from` and `mail.force_from_name` options for forcing From: address for all outgoing email

* Inconsistent tag markup for new and existing tags when editing items ([#854](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/pull/854), contributed by [@luku](https://github.com/luku))
* Deprecation notice when running on PHP 7.2+ ([#860](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/pull/860), contributed by [@Daniel-KM](https://github.com/Daniel-KM))
* "Remember me" checkbox on login non-functional on PHP 7.2+ ([#872](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/872))
* Invalid SQL mode error when running on MySQL 8 ([#858](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/858))
* Migration error when migrating from 1.x using MySQL 5.7+ ([#831](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/831))
* `item_next` and `item_prev` filters had no way to indicate the end of the sequence ([#851](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/851))
* Inconsistent form enctype between collection add and edit forms ([#856](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/856))
* `items_output_url` page detection fails on "items" pages added by plugins, leading to incorrect feed URLs ([#880](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/880))

## Improvements

* "Simple" item search converted to use subqueries, leads to a significant observed speed increase on modern MySQL versions
* Public-side file show page now includes a link back to the parent item
* "Browse by tag" view for items now sorts tags alphabetically by default
* New "back to top" link in admin footer
* ZendS3 storage adapter now leaves slashes unencoded in URLs
* ZendS3 storage adapter will "chunk" expiration times, allowing for some end-user caching by preventing the URL from changing on every request
* reCAPTCHA text specifies that v2 keys must be used

## For Developers

* New `html_purifier_config_setup` filter ([#857](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/pull/857), contributed by [@luku](https://github.com/luku))
* New `image_tag_attributes` filter ([#871](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/issues/871))
* New `files_for_item` filter
* New option `filesForItem` passed through to `file_markup` helper to indicate when files are being rendered as part of a call to `files_for_item`
* New `file_markup_options` filter for modifying the options passed to `file_markup`
* New `file_markup_files` filter for modifying the list of files to be rendered by `file_markup`

## Bundled Add-ons

* Thanks, Roy 2.5.1 (fixed visual spacing issues with featured blocks on homepage)
* Exhibit Builder 3.4.2 (updated translations)
* Simple Pages 3.1.2 (updated translations)

## Internationalization

* Updated translations for Bengali, Catalan, Czech, Danish, Esperanto, Spanish, Estonian, French, Galician, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Portuguese (Brazil), Slovak, Serbian, Turkish, Ukrainian

#### Omeka 2.2 CSRF And Stored XSS Vulnerability

Title: Omeka 2.2 CSRF And Stored XSS Vulnerability

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2014-5193](ZSL-2014-5193.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Cross-Site Scripting

Risk: (3/5)

Release Date: 17.07.2014
##### Summary

Omeka is a free, flexible, and open source web-publishing
platform for the display of library, museum, archives, and scholarly
collections and exhibitions. Its 'five-minute setup' makes launching
an online exhibition as easy as launching a blog.
##### Description

Omeka version 2.2 suffers from a cross-site request forgery and a
stored xss vulnerabilities. The application allows users to perform
certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity
checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform
certain actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user
visits a malicious web site. Input passed to the 'api\_key\_label' POST
parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of an affected site.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
