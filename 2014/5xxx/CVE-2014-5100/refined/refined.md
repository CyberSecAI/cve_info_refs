  "CVE-2014-5100": {
    "description": "Omeka version 2.2 suffers from a cross-site request forgery and a stored xss vulnerabilities. The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform certain actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious web site. Input passed to the 'api_key_label' POST parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of input sanitization and CSRF protection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
