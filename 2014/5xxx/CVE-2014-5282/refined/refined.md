Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-5282:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Docker handles image tags when loading images using `docker load`. Specifically, tagging an image with a 64-character ID consisting of hexadecimal characters [0-9a-f] could cause a subsequent pull of a different image to be redirected to the content of the tagged image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Image Tag Manipulation:** The core vulnerability is the ability to manipulate image tags in a way that leads to an unintended redirection during image pulls. This occurs when an image is tagged with a 64-character ID.
- **Unvalidated Tag Input:** The Docker Remote API and CLI do not properly validate the format and content of image tags used with the 'docker load' command, specifically when such a tag is equal to a 64-character hex id.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Image Redirection:** An attacker can cause a pull operation for a legitimate image to be redirected to a malicious or different image.
- **Potential for Malicious Image Deployment:** This redirection can lead to the deployment of compromised or unauthorized images on a system when a user or script expects to pull a different image.

**Attack vectors:**

- **`docker load` command:** The primary attack vector is through the `docker load` command. An attacker would need to have the ability to load a crafted image via `docker load`.
- **Untrusted Images:** The vulnerability is triggered when loading untrusted images.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to load images:** The attacker needs to be able to use the `docker load` command.
- **Crafted Image:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control a Docker image that is tagged with a 64 character hex id.
- **Target User:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make a target user pull an image after the attacker loaded the specially tagged image.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Docker versions prior to 1.3.
- Images pulled from DockerHub or private registries are not directly vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is related to image tagging using 64-character hexadecimal strings and `docker load`.
- The recommended fix is to upgrade to Docker 1.3 or later.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Windisch of Docker, Inc.
