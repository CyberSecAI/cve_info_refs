Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-5447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect default file permissions on configuration files. Specifically, the files `/etc/zarafa/webaccess-ajax/config.php` (Zarafa WebAccess) and `/etc/zarafa/webapp/config.php` (Zarafa WebApp) containing `PASSWORD_KEY` and `PASSWORD_IV` constants, are created with default permissions of `root:root` and `644`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The configuration files containing encryption keys are readable by all local users due to the `644` permission settings. This violates the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of Encrypted Passwords:**  An attacker with local access can read the `PASSWORD_KEY` and `PASSWORD_IV` from the configuration files. This allows the attacker to decrypt symmetrically encrypted passwords stored in PHP session files, which were intended to be protected. This is similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0103.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the Zarafa Collaboration Platform is installed. This means they must be able to log in to the system or otherwise gain access to the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a user on the local system with the ability to read files on the file system.
*   The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be root, as the vulnerable files have permissions that allow all local users to read them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Zarafa WebAccess version 7.1.10 and later, and Zarafa WebApp version 1.6 beta and later.
*   The issue is specifically related to the permissions of the config files containing encryption keys and not the encryption algorithm itself.
*  The fix involves correcting the file permissions to prevent unauthorized access to the encryption keys.
