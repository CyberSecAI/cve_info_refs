  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL chain, failing to ensure that the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."

  "additional_notes": "The provided document includes a link to a spreadsheet containing details of affected applications, and that there were over 23,000 vulnerable applications identified. It also provides references to the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java,  and testing methodology, and a blog post about the vulnerability. The document also mentions that the Federal Trade Commission has settled charges with some vendors for failing to secure transmission of sensitive data."
