  Yes, a product with an affected JSONP endpoint can have its own
  individual CVE ID. It is also possible that the vendor of a
  JSONP endpoint has determined that a successful attack is entirely
  the fault of the SWF parser, and does not want to have a CVE ID.
  This might, hypothetically, occur if the JSONP response from a
  product is always noncompliant SWF data, but some SWF parsers accept
  it anyway. ]

Use CVE-2014-5242.

Use CVE-2014-5243.

Before updating, tried one PoC:  1. Tested for JSONP injection MediaWiki bug 38187 (CVE-2014-4671).  Requesting .../api.php?action=query&format=json&callback=pwned from the wiki's returned 'pwned([])'.  Had 'pwned' been a cleverly crafted embedded SWF, converted to ï»¿only alphanumeric characters in order to abuse JSONP endpoints, sensitive data could be obtained from this server by it using GET requests and sent to an outside server using POSTs.  After updating to 1.23.2 and creating new instances, the request returned '/**/pwned([])â, which starts with illegal characters, thus disabling the exploit.  I didnât test bug 66608. I seems xpdf-tools in only available from outside sources. Bug 65778 is restricted, so didnât test that either.  All database backends function as expected.

Package        : mediawiki
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-5241 CVE-2014-5243
Debian Bug     : 752622 758510

It was discovered that MediaWiki, a website engine for collaborative
work, is vulnerable to JSONP injection in Flash (CVE-2014-5241) and
clickjacking between OutputPage and ParserOutput (CVE-2014-5243). The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MediaWiki to the new upstream
version 1.19.18, which includes additional changes.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.18+dfsg-0+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thanks Kevin, that's definitely an issue. I'm not sure what our options are for checking the properties of transcluded pages, but that seems like something we should do.

Adding Brad and Tim, in case they've thought through this already.

Copy prevent-clickjacking between OutputPage and ParserOutput

I haven't thought this through yet. But it looks like we already have functions copying metadata back and forth between ParserOutput and OutputPage, so fixing it could easily go like this:

1. Have a 'mPreventClickjacking' flag in ParserOutput.
2. Have ParserOutput::addOutputPageMetadata() combine its flag with the one from the passed OutputPage.
3. Have OutputPage::addParserOutputNoText() do the same thing from the passed ParserOutput.

Copy prevent-clickjacking between OutputPage and ParserOutput

I updated Brad's patch to take out the indentation change-- I'd like to make sure the security part is as small a change as possible. I'll submit an indentation change for all those once this is public.
