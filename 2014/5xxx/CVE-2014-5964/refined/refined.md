The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5964.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of verification of the SSL chain
- Failure to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS
- Possible credential theft.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks, including public WiFi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
