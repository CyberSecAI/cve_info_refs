The provided content relates to CVE-2014-5658.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing an attacker on the same network to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing.
- Possibility of arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when an attacker is on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attack is based on intercepting and manipulating HTTPS traffic due to the lack of proper SSL certificate validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the target Android device. This could be on a public Wi-Fi network, or any network that the attacker controls/has access to.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (MITM).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content references a spreadsheet that contains a list of affected applications and fix availability, however the spreadsheet cannot be accessed.
- The document provides a link to the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java with further information.
- The document also mentions that the Federal Trade Commission settled charges with two vendors (Fandango and Credit Karma) for similar SSL issues.
- The document also suggests workarounds like avoiding affected applications and avoiding untrusted networks.
