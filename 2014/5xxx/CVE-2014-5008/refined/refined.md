Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-5008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2014-5008 lies in an incomplete fix within the Snoopy library, a PHP class that simulates a web browser. Specifically, the fix attempted to address a command injection vulnerability by using `escapeshellcmd()`. However, this was insufficient, and using `escapeshellarg()` was required.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, stemming from the improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` when constructing command-line arguments for `curl` within the Snoopy library. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the command line that `curl` would execute, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application, with the privileges of the user running the application. This can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Stealing sensitive data.
    - **System Compromise:** Gaining full control of the server.
    - **Malware Installation:** Installing malware or other malicious software.
    - **Denial of Service:** Crashing the server or rendering services unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated HTTP Headers:** The attack vector involves manipulating HTTP headers, specifically the Host header, within requests handled by the Snoopy library. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when processed by Snoopy, injects commands via the improperly escaped command-line arguments to `curl`.
    - Example of a malicious URL: `https://127.0.0.1%60sleep+15%60/foo.rss`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests containing a maliciously crafted URL targeting the vulnerable Snoopy code.
- **No Authentication Required** Based on the information provided, this vulnerability doesn't appear to require any authentication, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to exploit this.

**Additional details:**
- This CVE is related to a series of incomplete fixes related to command execution flaws in the Snoopy library.
- The initial fix for a similar issue used `escapeshellcmd()`, but the proper solution required `escapeshellarg()` to properly escape arguments and prevent command injection.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL that manipulates the host part of the url.
- The root cause was ultimately resolved by removing the curl code from Snoopy, and implementing the equivalent functionality using openssl directly.
