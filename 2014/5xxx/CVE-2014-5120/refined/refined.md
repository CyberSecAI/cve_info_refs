Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-5120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the PHP's GD library and its handling of file paths. The library does not properly validate file paths, specifically it fails to check for null bytes when processing file names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when processing file paths, allowing a null byte to prematurely terminate a path.
- **Use of Potentially Malicious File Path:** The application uses a file path that is provided by an external source (e.g. an image file), making it vulnerable if this path is not validated correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access/Overwrite:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by supplying a maliciously crafted file path that contains a null byte, which will prematurely terminate the path. This allows a PHP application to access unexpected files and potentially overwrite them.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some contexts, writing to arbitrary files on the system could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** This is a remote attack vector where the attacker needs to provide a malicious file, such as a JPEG or TIFF, which contains a manipulated path with null byte to be processed by a PHP application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the file path that is being processed by the vulnerable PHP application, generally through the use of a specially crafted file.
- **Targeting PHP Application:**  The attacker must target a PHP application that utilizes the vulnerable image handling functions of the GD library.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the PHP application uses vulnerable GD functions and how to exploit it through specially crafted input.
