Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Disqus WordPress Plugin v2.77 has multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities due to the lack of nonce checks for GET requests. Although nonce checks were implemented for POST requests, they were not applied to GET requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate the origin of GET requests that modify the plugin's state. This lack of validation allows an attacker to craft malicious links or embed them into web pages, tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
*   **Lack of Nonce Verification for GET Requests:** The plugin only verifies nonces for POST requests, leaving GET requests vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Plugin Activation/Deactivation:** An attacker can activate or deactivate the Disqus plugin on the target WordPress site.
*   **Comment Import/Export:** An attacker can import or export comments between the WordPress database and Disqus servers. This could lead to data manipulation or loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker could send crafted URLs to a logged-in WordPress administrator, tricking them into clicking the link and triggering the malicious action.
*   **Embedded iframes/Images:** An attacker could embed malicious GET requests in iframes or images on a website. When a logged-in WordPress user visits the malicious page, the browser will automatically send the forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress admin panel, but needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with the malicious links/content.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable GET request URLs that control the plugin's state or comment import/export functionalities.
*   The attacker can use social engineering to trick an authenticated user into clicking the malicious link or visiting a website with malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post emphasizes that the plugin developers were already aware of CSRF vulnerabilities and had attempted to fix them, however, they failed to implement CSRF protection for GET requests.
*   The provided examples of vulnerable URLs clearly show the absence of nonces for GET request parameters related to plugin activation/deactivation and comment import/export.
*   The plugin was updated in version 2.79 to address this CSRF issue.
