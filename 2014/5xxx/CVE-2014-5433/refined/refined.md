- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cleartext storage of sensitive information on the Wireless Battery Module (WBM) of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The WBM stores wireless account credentials in cleartext, allowing unauthorized access via command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute commands to view the cleartext wireless account credentials stored on the WBM. This can lead to gaining access to the host network.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access to the WBM via network connectivity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the WBM can exploit the vulnerability.
