## Details

Laszlo Ersek discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in the vga

device. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary

host memory. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10.

([CVE-2014-3615](/security/CVE-2014-3615))

Xavier Mehrenberger and Stephane Duverger discovered that QEMU incorrectly

handled certain udp packets when using guest networking. A malicious guest

could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3640](/security/CVE-2014-3640))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled parameter validation in

the vmware\_vga device. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue to

write into memory of the host, leading to privilege escalation.

([CVE-2014-3689](/security/CVE-2014-3689))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled USB xHCI controller live

migration. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-5263](/security/CVE-2014-5263))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled memory in the

ACPI PCI hotplug interface. A malicious guest could possibly use this issue

to access memory of the host, leading to information disclosure or

privilege escalation. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-5388](/security/CVE-2014-5388))

James Spadaro discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain VNC

bytes\_per\_pixel values. An attacker having access to a VNC console could

possibly use this issue to cause a guest to crash, resulting in a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-7815](/security/CVE-2014-7815))

# CVE request Qemu: out of bounds memory access

*From*: P J P <ppandit () redhat com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

   Hello,

```
An out of bounds memory access flaw was found in Qemu's ACPI PCI hotplug
interface. It leads to Qemu's memory corruption via OOB write(4 bytes) and
information disclosure(~12 bytes) through OOB read.
```

```
A user with a custom PCI device could use this flaw to leak qemu process'
memory bytes or corrupt them on the host.
```

Upstream fix:
- -------------
  -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-08/msg03338.html>

Thank you.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1132956#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2014-08-22 12:42:35 UTC  ``` An out of bounds memory access flaw was found in Qemu's ACPI PCI hotplug interface. It leads to Qemu's memory corruption via OOB write(4 bytes) and  information disclosure(~12 bytes) through OOB read.  A user with a custom PCI device could use this flaw to leak qemu process' memory bytes or corrupt them on the host.  Upstream fix: -------------   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-08/msg03338.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1132956#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2014-08-22 12:51:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue does not affect the versions of qemu-kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1132956#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-25 05:50:46 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-5388](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-5388) to this issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/440>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1132956#c4)  Prasad Pandit    2014-08-25 06:05:45 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Michael S.
