Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-5162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a buffer underrun vulnerability in the Catapult DCT2000 and IrDA dissectors within Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific vulnerability is a buffer underrun, which occurs when the dissector tries to access memory before the allocated buffer. This can happen when processing malformed or crafted network packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application, resulting in denial of service. The application may become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability in two ways:
1. Injecting a malformed packet onto the network while Wireshark is actively capturing traffic.
2. Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file (.pcap).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be able to either:
1. Inject network traffic onto a network that is being captured by a vulnerable Wireshark instance.
2. Provide a user with a crafted malicious capture file for them to open with Wireshark.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark version 1.10.9 and later.
- The vulnerability is also identified as `wnpa-sec-2014-08`
- The provided documents link CVE-2014-5161 and CVE-2014-5162 to the same `wnpa-sec-2014-08` issue, suggesting they stem from the same code flaw.
