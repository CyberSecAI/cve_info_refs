**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) does not properly enforce user access controls when parsing XML content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control enforcement in MSXML during XML parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain access to the user's personal information from the local system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a specially crafted website that, when visited, invokes MSXML through Internet Explorer to exploit the vulnerability.
- This includes compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content/ads.
- The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious website (e.g., through links in emails, instant messages, or banner ads).
- Non-Microsoft web applications and services using the MSXML library to parse XML are also potentially vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into existing websites.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website, requiring social engineering techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) 3.0 and 6.0 on multiple Windows versions.
