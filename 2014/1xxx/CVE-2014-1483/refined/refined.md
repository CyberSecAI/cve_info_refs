  "CVE-2014-1483": {
    "description": "Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.",
    "root_cause": "Timing flaw in document.elementFromPoint and document.caretPositionFromPoint when used on cross-origin iframes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Timing Attack",
      "Cross-Origin Policy Violation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal confidential information by observing the time it takes for the `document.elementFromPoint` and `document.caretPositionFromPoint` functions to execute on cross-origin iframes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted webpage containing a cross-domain iframe.",
      "Timing-based observation of function execution."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to embed an iframe pointing to a different origin and execute javascript on the parent page.",
       "more_info": "The vulnerability is related to how elementFromPoint() and caretPositionFromPoint() functions descend into the iframe's DOM without proper cross-origin checks, revealing the structure through timing differences. Also, information on line wrapping and text can be obtained."
