How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-50

## Clickjacking through cursor invisibility after Flash interaction

Announced
June 10, 2014
Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
High
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 30

### Description

Security researcher **Jordi Chancel** reported a mechanism where
the cursor can be rendered invisible after it has been used on an embedded flash
object when used outside of the object. This flaw can be in used in combination
with an image of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to
clickjacking during interactions with HTML content subsequently. This issue only
affects OS X and is not present on Windows or Linux systems.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517
Steps to reproduce:
firstly i would to say that it's not a flash issue and it's works only for firefox for mac os x (don't works on WINDOWS , don't works on Google Chrome , don't works on Opera, don't works on safari).
when you go on a flash object that defined the cursor like unvisible and you go on a <div> with the cursor , the cursor is totaly unvisible (don't works on WINDOWS , don't works on Google Chrome , don't works on Opera, don't works on safari).
This can lead to clickjacking , cursorjacking , spoofing or others...
steps:
1 : go to the flash object (in center into the flash object)
2 : wait 2 s
3 : go with your cursor down (div t2)
4 : Cursor are cursor-jacked
(view this youtube video for more details => <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lu8pcWvUVY&feature=youtu.be> )
Actual results:
Cursor are totaly unsibile , when you try to install a xpi , the cursor is totally unvisible.
Expected results:
this can be used for clickjacking / cursorjacking / spoofing or others ,
this issue works only on Firefox for MAC .

I'm trying to understand why the real mouse pointer isn't reset to normal
when it's outside the Flash object, is it the overlapping boxes with high
z-index that prevents that?

The mouse pointer is still visible over the plugin on Linux, on OSX it's hidden.
Adding onmouseout/over callbacks shows that Gecko is aware the mouse has left
the plugin element on both platforms. I wonder if we could use that to send
an event to the plugin somehow to inform it the mouse pointer is outside?Component: General → Plug-insKeywords: [testcase](/buglist.cgi?keywords=testcase&resolution=---)Summary: Firefox for MAC OS X - cursor can be totaly unvisible using flash object and div (leading to clickjacking , cursorjacking or others) → Firefox for MAC OS X - cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div (leading to clickjacking , cursorjacking or others)

Playing with this bug's testcase (just moving the mouse around over it) I sometimes see \*two\* cursors in different positions -- one's the standard OS pointer cursor, and I suspect the other is something created by Flash.
So I wonder if there's confusion about the cursor's coordinates, and if it's not actually invisible but offscreen.
Mats, do you see this?
The STR from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") is very vague and hard to understand. Jordi, I realize that English isn't your first language. But I understand some French, so please try re-writing the STR in French. Make it as detailed and precise as you can.
Once I understand it, I'll re-write your STR in English.

quand vous allez sur l'object flash , le curseur devient invisible , et quand vous allez vers le bas ensuite un faux curseur décalé apparait, (le vrai curseur reste tout de même invisible comme a pu le remarquer Mats Palmgren.
ceci peut conduire a des attaque de clickjacking/cursorjacking/spoofing non négligeable!
je ne comprend pas pourquoi chez toi le curseur apparait normalement après que tu l'ais placé sur l'objet flash et déplacé ensuite vers un div..?

Yes, the second cursor is part of the clickjacking trick; it's an abs.pos. image
that's intended to look like the real mouse cursor. When hiding the real cursor
succeeds, it makes you think that's where the mouse pointer is. [Bug 899992](/show_bug.cgi?id=899992 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - PoC for cursorjacking (WebCam cursorjacking on mozilla firefox 22)") uses
the same trick but is using cursor:url(transparent-image) to hide the real cursor.
You could use cursor:none too.
I think you can ignore that part, it's just a demonstration that hiding the real
mouse pointer can be used for clickjacking. The interesting part is that the
plugin fails to reset the cursor to normal when moving the mouse outside it.

Thanks Mats.
I remember seeing (some months ago, testing with my Debug Events Plugin from [bug 441880](/show_bug.cgi?id=441880 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simple NPAPI plugin for testing browser/plugin interactions on OS X")) some cases where we \*don't\* send a mouse-exit event to the plugin. If I remember right it had something to do with overlapping objects (as are present in this bug's testcase). When I get the chance (in the next few days?) I'll test again with it to see if that might be the problem here.

I didn't understand your STR (steps to reproduce), so I didn't use
them. I just moved (not dragged) the mouse around above the testcase.
I \*still\* don't really understand them. Could you please re-write
your steps-to-reproduce, in French and in detail?

I can see this pretty easily. The cursor simply doesn't reappear after moving first to the SWF (wait 2 seconds) and then to the DIV on the right. At this point, the cursor remains invisible, and indeed one could easily create a fake cursor that could trick the user into clicking something they should not.
I don't know what rating this class of attack gets, but it's clearly a bug.

"Move", not "drag"?
Once I know we'll have clear STR, and I'll be able to take a closer look at this bug (replacing the SWF with my Debug Events Plugin).

because if the user don't see where he clicks , this can lead to clickjacking or cursor jacking or other spoofing...

I replaced the Flash plugin with my Debug Events plugin in this bug's
testcase, and found that I'd remembered correctly.
After you move the mouse over either of the two big divs to the top or
left of the plugin and wait 2 seconds, both of them are resized to
partially overlap the plugin. Once this happens, moving the mouse out
of the plugin to the top or right (where the overlapping occurs)
doesn't cause a NPCocoaEventMouseExited event to be sent to the
plugin.
It looks like the divs are above the plugin in the z-order. I'll try
to set the plugin above them and see if it makes any difference.

It does -- in this case the bug doesn't happen.
So the bug here is that plugins don't receive mouse-exit events when
moving the mouse out of the plugin over an object that partially
overlaps it and has a higher z-order.
Even if this bug is Mac-only, I strongly suspect the problem is
somewhere in cross-platform code (not in widget code). Mats, Matt, do
either of you have any idea what it might be?

I think we can now say that this bug is confirmed.
Even if no actual proof of clickjacking has been presented, and the testcase we have is both overly complex and not airtight, it's pretty clear that \*someone\* could use the bug I described in [comment #17](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") to perform a cursorjack/clickjack.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueWhiteboard: [description in comment #17]

I've now discovered that this bug is caused at least partly by a bug in ChildViewMouseTracker::ViewForEvent(), here:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/c962bde5ac0b/widget/cocoa/nsChildView.mm#l6386>
The problem is that when a non-plugin object overlaps a plugin object, -[NSView hitTest:] isn't a good way to find which NSView is under the mouse (or more precisely, which NSView the Gecko object under the mouse belongs to).
I'll be working on this.

Can we try to find a solution where it's not necessary to duplicate Gecko's event targeting logic in widget code? For example, I'd be very happy if ChildViewMouseTracker could just always dispatch the event to the top level ChildView in the NSView hierarchy of the target window. If we do that, will Gecko automatically forward events over plugins to the target plugin?

So, obviously we should fix the event-related bug we're seeing w/r/t mouse events and plugins - for the sake of correctness and also clickjacking.
However - slightly OT but relevant - for the specific problem of cam/mic UI clickjacking, a bigger solution for this might be to somehow always show the cursor when that UI is displayed. That would prevent this entire class of attacks. It's what the Flash Player does when its own cam/mic UI is active. I guess I'll go about filing a different bug for that.

We can't just dispatch the event to the top level ChildView in the
NSView hierarchy. Yes, Gecko will (probably) automatically forward
events over plugins to their correct targets. But we need to know in
widget code (in ChildViewMouseTracker::ViewForEvent()) what the target
ChildView will actually be -- otherwise we won't be able to know (in
ChildViewMouseTracker::ReEvaluateMouseEnterState()) when to send a
mouse-entered or mouse-exited event.
We don't need to "duplicate Gecko's event targeting logic". There's a
NS\_QUERY\_DOM\_WIDGET\_HITTEST event, which we're already using in
-[ChildView currentEventShouldFocusPlugin]. For a given nsIWidget, it
queries Gecko to find out whether or not a particular point "hits" the
widget -- which is all we need to know.

Good point. Though I'd be surprised if Gecko still needed view-level mouse enter/exit events.

Can you put this part into an override of the NSView "hitTest:" method instead, and keep the existing code in ChildViewMouseTracker as-is? I'm envisioning something like
- (NSView\*)hitTest:(NSPoint\*)aPoint
{
NSView\* target = [super hitTest:aPoint];
if (target == self && [self isPluginView]) {
...
if (gecko says this widget is not hit) {
return nil;
}
}
return target;
}

I'm not sure whether what you specifically suggest would work: -[ChildView hitTest:] needs to return an accurate result, not just nil if the particular plugin isn't "hit".
But it \*would\* be "neater" to put this logic into -[ChildView hitTest:], if that isn't too much trouble.
I'll see what I can come up with.

Actually the solution is obvious, now that I think about it:
Have -[ChildView hitTest] call [superview hitTest:] if the plugin it corresponds to isn't "hit".
Now let's see if what's obvious is also correct :-)

Actually Markus was right (in [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")). But there's some weirdness I need to figure out before I can post another patch -- the processing of the NS\_QUERY\_DOM\_WIDGET\_HITTEST event sometimes fails mysteriously.
I'll continue working on this next week.

Thanks for your suggestion, Markus. It allowed me to combine my fix for this bug with my old fix for [bug 627649](/show_bug.cgi?id=627649 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Mac] Some events incorrectly passed to a plugin that occur over the plugin"). It also uncovered failures in the handler for NS\_QUERY\_DOM\_WIDGET\_HITTEST events that weren't apparent (for some reason) either in my earlier patch for this bug or my patch for [bug 627649](/show_bug.cgi?id=627649 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Mac] Some events incorrectly passed to a plugin that occur over the plugin").
It turns out the handler was doing far more (in its Init() and InitCommon() methods) that was necessary to handle NS\_QUERY\_DOM\_WIDGET\_HITTEST events, and was failing when some of these extra calls failed.
Markus, I'd like you to review the widget code changes. Smaug, I'm asking you to review the DOM event handler changes.

Yes, it does :-)
(In reply to [comment #33](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603#c33 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div"))
> nit: If you put this kungFuDeathGrip only for dispatching the event,

I don't understand.
ContentEventHandler::InitCommon() prior to my patch
(ContentEventHandler::InitBasic() with my patch) contains the
following:
// If text frame which has overflowing selection underline is dirty,
// we need to flush the pending reflow here.
mPresShell->FlushPendingNotifications(Flush\_Layout);
// Flushing notifications can cause mPresShell to be destroyed ([bug 577963](/show_bug.cgi?id=577963 "RESOLVED FIXED - [10.6] Crash [@ nsContentEventHandler::InitCommon ]")).
NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE(!mPresShell->IsDestroying(), NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE);
So pretty clearly processing a NS\_QUERY\_DOM\_WIDGET\_HITTEST event \*can\*
cause the widget it's dispatched on to be destroyed. That's why I put
in the kungFuDeathGrip, and also why I null-checked mGeckoChild after
dispatching the event.
> nit: By same reason, this can be gone or replacing with NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE.
I'll use NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE.

Markus pointed out to me that the NS\_ENSURE\_\* macros have been deprecated and replaced. See [bug 672843](/show_bug.cgi?id=672843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Create new macros and inline functions to replace NS_ENSURE* macros").
But what I already have fits the new style just fine, so I'll keep it and not use \*any\* macro.

We judge each bug on its own merit. Feel free to file new bugs, but don't assume they will be rated the same as this one unless we feel it's appropriate. Thank you.

Is there a reason that this sec-high went in without sec-approval? being set?
We should probably take this in Aurora and Beta if this is a sec-high.
Does this affect ESR24?

Fix rev1
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Probably present since earliest days of Cocoa widgets
User impact if declined: Users will be exposed to a sec-high bug
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Substantial testing by myself, two weeks on m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): low risk
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: none
This patch is quite large (and removes a lot of code). But the reasoning behind it is well understood, and no regressions have surfaced after two weeks on m-c.

Verified fixed also on latest Fx30 and Fx31, and Fx24.6.0esr.
Unfortunately, it appears that we may have broken Flash mouse cursor hiding in general on Fx24.6.0esr, Mac only. I've filed a separate bug for that - [bug 1021815](/show_bug.cgi?id=1021815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flash hide mouse cursor broken in ESR24.6.0").

I've confirmed [bug 102185](/show_bug.cgi?id=102185 "VERIFIED FIXED - NumberFunctionCall::evaluate needs cleanup") by testing with today's esr24 nightly. And
I've confirmed that my patch for this bug is the trigger by backing it
out, then seeing that the bug disappears.
Off the top of my head, I have \*no\* idea how my patch could have had
this effect. Note that [bug 1021815](/show_bug.cgi?id=1021815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flash hide mouse cursor broken in ESR24.6.0") doesn't happen on any of the other
branches where my patch for this bug landed.
I will dig around a bit, trying to find an esr24-specific fix. But
I'm not going to make any heroic efforts. So we need to consider 1)
backing out my patch for this bug on esr24, and leaving it unfixed
there; 2) leaving [bug 1021815](/show_bug.cgi?id=1021815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flash hide mouse cursor broken in ESR24.6.0") unfixed.

Thanks Steven, for the investigation. I'd choose option #1 personally, as I don't think the security bug is so bad as to warrant breaking legit Flash content. My concern is that ESR builds might be using enterprise apps that are built in Flash/Flex, and mouse event issues might cause them to break or be noticeably impaired.
I'm inclined to say that this does not impede the release of Fx24.6.0esr, but others can weigh in on that.

I'm going to be spending at least another day on [bug 1021815](/show_bug.cgi?id=1021815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flash hide mouse cursor broken in ESR24.6.0"), next week. We may get lucky -- it may turn out to be something stupid (and easily fixable).
But if we \*aren't\* lucky, I agree with your assessment. Especially if you add in 1020763, it looks my patch has completely broken the passing of events to NPAPI plugins on the esr24 branch :-( Allowing that to happen is much worse than leaving this bug unfixed in esr24.

I agree with the back out. I don't think it's suitable to ship ESR with the reported breakage. We need a back out today following which I'll kick off a new build. Matt has agreed to spoke test once the build is complete.
Al - Can you please confirm that the sec team is OK shipping this bug in ESR 24.6.0?
Ryan - Can you please assist with the back out on ESR24?Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)

Attached patch

> it may turn out to be something stupid (and easily fixable)
It was :-( I should have been using screen coordinates in the esr24 version of -[ChildView hitTest:].
Here's a patch that fixes [bug 1021815](/show_bug.cgi?id=1021815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flash hide mouse cursor broken in ESR24.6.0") in my tests. It's more difficult to tell about [bug 1020763](/show_bug.cgi?id=1020763 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - [OSX] 24.6.0-ESR: cannot click on player controls (Flash, Silverlight)"), which doesn't have good STR. But (testing with my Debug Events Plugin from [bug 441880](/show_bug.cgi?id=441880 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simple NPAPI plugin for testing browser/plugin interactions on OS X")) I did notice some weirdness clicking on a plugin that this patch clears up.
Matt, please test this patch. If you don't see any problems I'll ask someone for a review -- probably Markus Stange.

I built Fx24esr with your patch. Everything seems OK. The hidden mouse cases that broke before appear to be fixed. I also did some testing with a second display and YouTube video controls, as well as some scenarios with tabbing around inside SWFs.
I say we're fine and we can check again once the patch lands. Thanks Steven!Flags: needinfo?(mwobensmith)

Your code should work, too, but it seems unnecessarily complicated. But since it has already been tested and we're not going to be bothered by it on mozilla-central, it's probably better to keep what you have.

Actually that might also have worked.
But though the code is more complex, it's simpler (and safer) to put everything in screen coordinates and then subtract the widget offset. In any case, as you've said, we don't need to make this patch as neat as possible.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
