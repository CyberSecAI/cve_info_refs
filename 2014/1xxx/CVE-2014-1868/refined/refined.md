The provided content is related to CVE-2014-1868.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of XML entity expansion (XEE) in the Restlet Framework. Specifically, the framework was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the XML parsing components of the Restlet Framework, specifically:
-  XMLRepresentation and its subclasses (SaxRepresentation, DomRepresentation).
-  Representations that handle serialization/deserialization from class instances to XML streams, such as JacksonRepresentation, JibxRepresentation, XStreamRepresentation, and SyndFeedRepresentation (rome).
The framework was not properly configured to prevent the expansion of external entities in XML documents, even when the `expandingEntityRefs` attribute was set to false.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform denial-of-service attacks (via "Billion Laughs" attack) or potentially gain access to sensitive information on the server by making it include external files via specially crafted XML documents.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending maliciously crafted XML documents to the vulnerable Restlet Framework endpoints. The framework's XML parsing components would then process these documents, leading to the expansion of external entities and triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to send requests containing malicious XML payloads to an application using the vulnerable Restlet Framework. This usually implies having network access to the application.
