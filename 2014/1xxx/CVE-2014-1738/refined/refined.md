{
  "CVE-2014-1738": {
    "description": "It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's floppy driver did not properly restrict access to certain pointers during processing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with write access to /dev/fdX can obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access via /dev/fdX",
       "FDRAWCMD ioctl"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with write access to /dev/fdX."
