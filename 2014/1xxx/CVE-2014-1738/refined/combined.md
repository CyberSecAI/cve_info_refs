## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0801)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user

space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD
IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this
flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-1737, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel

memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL
command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to
obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)

Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws
(CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their
privileges on the system.

Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Daley for reporting these issues.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0196 CVE-2014-1737 CVE-2014-1738 CVE-2014-2851
                 CVE-2014-3122

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation:

CVE-2014-0196

    Jiri Slaby discovered a race condition in the pty layer, which could
    lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-1737 / CVE-2014-1738

    Matthew Daley discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    FDRAWCMD ioctl and an information leak could result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2014-2851

    Incorrect reference counting in the ping_init_sock() function allows
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-3122

    Incorrect locking of memory can result in local denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u1. This update also fixes a regression in the isci
driver and suspend problems with certain AMD CPUs (introduced in the
updated kernel from the Wheezy 7.5 point release).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Linux kernel
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2014:0683-1
Rating: important
References: #875690 #875798
Cross-References: CVE-2014-0196 CVE-2014-1737 CVE-2014-1738
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Extension 11 SP3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now
available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 RealTime Extension kernel has
been updated to fix two critical security issues.
The following security bugs have been fixed:
\*
CVE-2014-1737: The raw\_cmd\_copyin function in drivers/block/floppy.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly handle error
conditions during processing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local
users to trigger kfree operations and gain privileges by leveraging write
access to a /dev/fd device. (bnc#875798)
\*
CVE-2014-1738: The raw\_cmd\_copyout function in
drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not
properly restrict access to certain pointers during processing of an
FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel heap memory by leveraging write access to a
/dev/fd device. (bnc#875798)
\*
CVE-2014-0196: The n\_tty\_write function in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c in
the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access
in the "LECHO & !OPOST" case, which allows local users to cause a denial
of service (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by
triggering a race condition involving read and write operations with long
strings. (bnc#875690)

Subject: Linux kernel floppy ioctl kernel code execution

Hi,

As this was posted to linux-distros, and was supposed to be made public
earlier this week, but so far wasn't published on oss-sec ...

Reported by Matthew Daley to security@...nel.org.

There apparently exists a proof of concept root exploit, that allows
local users with access to a floppy device to execute code in the linux
kernel.

(I think this needs a floppy driver to actually allow access to a floppy
 device. My machine only says "floppy0: no floppy controllers found" today.)

    floppy: don't write kernel-only members to FDRAWCMD ioctl output

    Do not leak kernel-only floppy_raw_cmd structure members to userspace.
    This includes the linked-list pointer and the pointer to the allocated
    DMA space.

    floppy: ignore kernel-only members in FDRAWCMD ioctl input

    Always clear out these floppy_raw_cmd struct members after copying the
    entire structure from userspace so that the in-kernel version is always
    valid and never left in an interdeterminate state.

An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now
available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel was updated to fix the
following severe security issues:
\*
CVE-2014-1737: The raw\_cmd\_copyin function in drivers/block/floppy.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly handle error
conditions during processing of an FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local
users to trigger kfree operations and gain privileges by leveraging write
access to a /dev/fd device. (bnc#875798)
\*
CVE-2014-1738: The raw\_cmd\_copyout function in
drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not
properly restrict access to certain pointers during processing of an
FDRAWCMD ioctl call, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel heap memory by leveraging write access to a
/dev/fd device. (bnc#875798)
\*
CVE-2014-0196: The n\_tty\_write function in drivers/tty/n\_tty.c in
the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access
in the "LECHO & !OPOST" case, which allows local users to cause a denial
of service (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by
triggering a race condition involving read and write operations with long
strings. (bnc#875690)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:0800 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0800)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled

the requeuing of certain Priority Inheritance (PI) futexes. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-3153, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user

space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD
IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this
flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.
(CVE-2014-1737, Important)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel

memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL
command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to
obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement. (CVE-2014-1738, Low)

Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use these two flaws
(CVE-2014-1737 in combination with CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their
privileges on the system.

Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook of Google for reporting
CVE-2014-3153, and Matthew Daley for reporting CVE-2014-1737 and
CVE-2014-1738. Google acknowledges Pinkie Pie as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-3153.

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not use
"rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from your
system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after determining that
the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.2 x86\_64

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2928-1                security@debian.org

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service/information leak
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2014-0196 CVE-2014-1737 CVE-2014-1738

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0196

    Jiri Slaby discovered a race condition in the pty layer, which could lead
    to a denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-1737 CVE-2014-1738

    Matthew Daley discovered an information leak and missing input
    sanitising in the FDRAWCMD ioctl of the floppy driver. This could result
    in a privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze6.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze6

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.  Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use [CVE-2014-1737](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1737) in combination with [CVE-2014-1738](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their privileges on the system.  IssueDescription CVE-2014-1738:  It was found that the Linux kernel's floppy driver leaked internal kernel memory addresses to user space during the processing of the FDRAWCMD IOCTL command. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to obtain information about the kernel heap arrangement.  Note: A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use [CVE-2014-1737](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1737) in combination with [CVE-2014-1738](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1738) to escalate their privileges on the system.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1094299#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-07-17 15:32:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2014:0900 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0900.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1094299#c19)  Vincent Danen    2014-07-17 15:45:18 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |
