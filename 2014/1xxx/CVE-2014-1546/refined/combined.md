Attached file
[poc.html](attachment.cgi?id=8452810)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8452810&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 (x86\_64)) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.153 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Hi,
I think you may already know about this vulnerability(no, take a look - miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/)
this vulnerability allows the page jsonrpc.cgi as a swf file then resulting in http request in local webserver(bugzilla.mozilla.org). To patch that add '/\*\*/' before the callback function.
Reproduce:
1. Log in bugzilla.
2. open poc.html(attached)
3. wait 10 seconds
4. you will be redirected to a page that contains the source code of 'bugzilla.mozilla.org'(was got via victim browser) so it contains your session security token.
Cheers,

Chrome and Opera aren't affected, as we send the |X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff| header with every response.

The code goes all the way back to Bugzilla 4.0 ( [http://git.mozilla.org/?p=bugzilla/bugzilla.git;a=blob;f=Bugzilla/WebService/Server/JSONRPC.pm;h=5ee341b4b11b38ffb951ed60721af6cc6afd4df6;hb=refs/heads/4.0#l91 [github]](https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/blob/4.0/Bugzilla/WebService/Server/JSONRPC.pm#L91) ). Released version have an extra new line before the closing brace which means a different patch it required for those branches.

Hold off on using that CVE until I get an answer from MITRE. It's possible we should just say we're fixing our version of the main [CVE-2014-4671](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4671) that covers the original vulnerability. That would conflict with their policy that fixing the same bug in different client libraries need separate CVEs, but then I'm not sure what [CVE-2014-4671](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4671) would cover because the primary blog post was about a technique, not a specific vulnerable software.Alias: CVE-2014-1546 → maybe-CVE-2014-1546

Using "nosniff" seems like the more principled approach. Why doesn't it work in Firefox? Is there a bug on that?

btw, couldnt get the bounty payment due that the banking informations used in the payment was a old one(my old bank account). Dont know why that happenned since i sent the right payment informations to `chris hoffman` told him that there were updates in my bank account but he/mozilla kept sending the payment to my old account that i don't have access anymore.
so, somebody responsable for bounty's payment can give me some explanation why'd it happend? also, could someone re-send the payment to the right payment informations that I provided?

FYI, we always set the version field of security bugs to the first release affected. In this specific case, the first release with this bug is Bugzilla 3.7.1, see [bug 550727](/show_bug.cgi?id=550727 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add JSONP Support to the JSON-RPC WebService Interface").Version: 4.0 → 3.7.1

Advisory: ========================  Updated bugzilla packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Adobe does not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against Bugzilla's JSONP endpoint, possibly obtaining sensitive bug information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API (CVE-2014-1546).

Note this from urpmi bugzilla:- "The setup used here differs from default one, to achieve better FHS compliance. - the constant files are in /usr/share/bugzilla - the variables files are in /var/lib/bugzilla - the configuration file will be generated in /etc/bugzilla & [the installation script is at] /usr/share/bugzilla/bin/checksetup.pl"   <http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/installation.html>  <http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/configuration.html> are good to follow (mostly). After you have confirmed the major dependancies cited:-  # /usr/share/bugzilla/bin/checksetup.pl --check-modules does a check of required & optional Perl modules. Only the first screenful+ really matters.  Bugzilla Configuration section 2.2.1. localconfig should really be in two sections, before & after database priming.  # /usr/share/bugzilla/bin/checksetup.pl    [creates /etc/bugzilla/localconfig]  2.2.2.

"$db_pass        the password for the user you [created] for your database"  2.2.3. checksetup.pl      [creates database and Bugzilla admin user]  # /usr/share/bugzilla/bin/checksetup.pl [lots of output]  Enter the e-mail address of the administrator: xxxxxxxxxxx  Enter the real name of the administrator: xxxxxx  Enter a password for the administrator account:   Please retype the password to verify:  Because Claire's earlier summary made no mention of 2.2.4. Web server/2.2.4.1. Bugzilla using Apache, I did *not* edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf as documented, (could find nothing Bugzilla in /var/www/), so tried  <http://localhost/bugzilla/> and it showed the "Welcome to Bugzilla" page. Ready to play with, hopefully. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=13840#c5)  Rémi Verschelde    2014-08-19 19:16:00 CEST  ``` I guess we can add MGA4-64-OK from your tests Lewis? ```  ---   CC: (none) => remi  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=13840#c6)  Lewis Smith    2014-08-19 20:21:22 CEST  ``` (In reply to Rémi Verschelde from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=13840#c5)) > I guess we can add MGA4-64-OK from your tests Lewis? No! All I got to was installing the release version for testing.  In fact, I cannot log into it... I noted the Admin username and password, but they yield always: "You tried to log in using the Lewis account, but Bugzilla is unable to trust your request. Make sure your web browser accepts cookies and that you haven't been redirected here from an external web site. Click here if you really want to log in.   Please press Back and try again"  [That the browser is OK is shown by my actual use of Bugzilla here in another tab].  The Bugzilla user name came from asking for the real name for the Admin account, and I replied Lewis; I have tried variants like lewis, alternative possible passwords, but the same failure. Sometimes the response is different: "Bugzilla needs a legitimate login and password to continue." with bare login dialogue; most reproduceable with a nonsense login name.  I tried creating a new account, but that was bounced because the e-mail address was already known.  So once more, advice welcome. Once logged in, the update should be quick to try. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=13840#c7)  claire robinson    2014-08-22 15:58:09 CEST  ``` The default login is the email/password you gave it when running checksetup.pl  Tested ok here mga4 64.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
