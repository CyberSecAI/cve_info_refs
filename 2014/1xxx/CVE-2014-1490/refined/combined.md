# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad](//linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad)

### Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin Schedule

Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017
* 18 July 2017

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are generally cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 113 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Please note that on April 18, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160 OpenSSL "Heartbleed"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-0160.html). This Critical Patch Update includes an update to MySQL Enterprise Server 5.6 and this update includes a fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-0160. Customers of other Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the [fixes](/security-alerts/opensslheartbleedcve-2014-0160.html)  that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1666884.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4150&id=1666884.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4236&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 20 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4170&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen and Sotaro Ikeda

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.

([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

Fabián Cuchietti and Ateeq ur Rehman Khan discovered that it was possible

to bypass Javascript execution restrictions when replying to or forwarding

mail messages in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to steal confidential information or modify message content.

([CVE-2013-6674](/security/CVE-2013-6674))

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle has received specific reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply these Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

Oracle acknowledges Dana Taylor of netinfiltration.com for bringing to Oracle's attention a number of sites that were vulnerable to disclosure of sensitive information because Oracle CPU fixes were not applied to those sites for more than a year.

This Critical Patch Update contains 154 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on September 26, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169 "Bash"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-7169.html) and other publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting GNU Bash. Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1912224.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1912224.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 22 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

             CVE-2013-4238
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vSphere product updates address a Cross Site Scripting issue,
   a certificate validation issue and security vulnerabilities in
   third-party libraries.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server Appliance 5.1 Prior to Update 3

   VMware vCenter Server 5.5 prior to Update 2
   VMware vCenter Server 5.1 prior to Update 3
   VMware vCenter Server 5.0 prior to Update 3c

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      vCSA           5.0        any       Not Affected

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM
      service.

      VMware would like to thank The Google Security Team for reporting
      this issue to us.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=930874#c0)• 11 years ago |

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #930857](/show_bug.cgi?id=930857 "RESOLVED FIXED - NewSessionTicket handshake message in a resumption handshake replaces cached session's ticket before handshake is finished") +++
It appear there are race conditions (TOCTOU, potentially use-after-free) to lack of locking around reads and updates of the sessionTicket field of sslSessionIDStr. For example, these races can happen when thread A is trying to resume a session concurrently with thread B that has already started resuming session that same session, and where thread B has received a NewSessionTicket extension that will cause it to update the sessionTicket field of the sid that thread A is trying to read. This may cause a use-after-free when ssl3\_SetSIDSessionTicket calls SECITEM\_FreeItem to free the session ticket data when ssl3\_SendSessionTicketXtn is trying to read it. There are probably other similar problems.
We need locks to protect the sessionTicket field when we read it in ssl3\_SendClientHello/ssl3\_SendSessionTicketXtn and ssl3\_HandleServerHello and and CacheSID, and when we change update it in ssl3\_SetSIDSessionTicket, at least.
Additionally, we may need to be careful about handling the case where the session ticket is modified by ssl3\_SetSIDSessionTicket between execution of the above functions; i.e. we probably can't just acquire/release a mutex around the access of the sessionTicket field independently in each of the aforementioned functions; instead, we need to save some state between calls to those functions. In the case of the gap between ssl3\_SendClientHello/ssl3\_SendSessionTicketXtn, we may be able to get away with just storing a PRBool sendSessionTicket in ss->ssl3.hs, instead of copying the entire ticket. I suspect that the type of problem described in this paragraph may occur even for single-threaded clients.
BTW, if we ever expose the session ticket to applications so that applications can associate the exact ticket used with a connection (actually a particular handshake on the connection), then would need to maintain an independent copy of the ticket data in ss->ssl3.hs at all times, instead of \*moving\* it from ss->ssl3.hs to the sid like this patch does.

This testing code is not perfect. All it does, basically, is ensure that we execute the code path that updates the session ticket during a resumption. The server will end up sending the same exact ticket (AFAICT) during the resumption, whereas this feature is intended for the server to send a new ticket, AFAICT.
Based on rsleevi's comments in [bug 909162](/show_bug.cgi?id=909162 "RESOLVED INVALID - Add a way for the server side of libssl to simulate TLS intolerance for testing"), I put some extra effort into making this test-only code optional for Google. Note that it won't be possible to build a working NSS with NSS\_SSL\_NO\_TEST\_ONLY\_FUNCTIONALITY defined because linking will fail due to the SSL\_TEST\_OptionSet function being in ssl.def. However, if you use your own build system then it should work fine. I am planning on updating the patch in [bug 909162](/show_bug.cgi?id=909162 "RESOLVED INVALID - Add a way for the server side of libssl to simulate TLS intolerance for testing") to be similar to this. FWIW, I looked into alternatives for testing this but all of them were way too much work compared to doing things this way. For example, TLS Lite doesn't support session tickets at all. I think the best path forward for test-only stuff is to accept that libssl will contain some minimal test-only code, and try to keep that test-only code out of the way as much as possible. This is better than not having any test coverage at all in the NSS test suite.
I added a new entry to sslstress.txt. If you delete all the lines in that file besides that one, and run the following, you will see the SSL\_TRC messages showing that we're now testing the NewSessionTicket during session resumption case:
SSLTRACE=3 OS\_TARGET=WIN95 NSS\_ENABLE\_ECC=1 HOST=localhost DOMSUF=local4 NSS\_SSL\_RUN=stress ./ssl.sh

Wan-Teh said that he'd review this bug fix before December 1. So, we would have time to fix it for Firefox 26 if we want to. I think it would be great if we could do that.
However, to minimize risk, we should probably release NSS 3.15.4 as NSS 3.15.3 + [bug 930857](/show_bug.cgi?id=930857 "RESOLVED FIXED - NewSessionTicket handshake message in a resumption handshake replaces cached session's ticket before handshake is finished") (this bug depends on that one) + [bug 930874](/show_bug.cgi?id=930874 "RESOLVED FIXED - TOCTOU, potential use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing due to lack of lock protecting the sessionTicket field of the sid") (this bug).
I will start a new thread on nss-dev about this, proposing a new long-term strategy for dealing with this type of thing.Flags: needinfo?(brian)

Is there any chance that this can be reviewed very soon (within a week)? If not, then we'll have to release 3.15.4 without it, because Firefox will need a 3.15.4 release very soon since Firefox 27 needs the NSS 3.15.4 release and Firefox 27 is progressing to our beta channel on Monday.Flags: needinfo?(wtc)

Attached patch

[Simple workaround: don't support session ticket renewal](attachment.cgi?id=8344037&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8344037&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=930874&attachment=8344037)

Brian: sorry about the delay of code review. I review your patch two weeks
ago but forgot to post my first thoughts here.
I think the cost of extra locking may not be worth the benefit of session
ticket renewal, so I wanted to suggest that we simply not support session
ticket reneal.
This patch does that. I can tweak this patch to also work around [bug 930857](/show_bug.cgi?id=930857 "RESOLVED FIXED - NewSessionTicket handshake message in a resumption handshake replaces cached session's ticket before handshake is finished")
by changing the new test added the beginning of ssl3\_SetSIDSessionTicket to
/\* Don't store the session ticket in sid unless the sid is brand new.
\* A brand new sid will be added to the client cache only after the
\* server's Finished message has been verified. \*/
if (sid->cached != never\_cached) {
UNLOCK\_CACHE;
return SECSuccess;
}
Let me know if you like this approach. I will try to review your patch later.

Simple workaround: don't support session ticket renewal

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Wan-Teh, thanks for making this patch. However, I don't think this is a good approach. I checked the OpenSSL blame and I found that OpenSSL has supported this ticket renewal functionality for six years. I think that shorter session ticket lifetimes with more frequent rotation are going to be more common in the future as people start writing more about best practices for session ticket use with respect to perfect forward secrecy. This idea is supported by this <https://jacob.hoffman-andrews.com/README/how-to-check-for-tls-ticket-key-rotation/> and agl's blog post on the subject.
Therefore, I think that it is worth optimizing this for maximum session reuse.
Note that in my patch, I use a reader-writer lock per session, and that lock will basically never be contested during reading or writing. Also note that in my patch, I switched the rotation code to use the per-session lock instead of the global cache mutex, so there should be even less contention (better performance) than before, in general. However, in the case of a single-threaded networking stack of a browser, the global cache lock is also going to be uncontested all the time. Therefore, if you think my patch is too complicated, and you think that the performance overhead of taking the global lock during reading and writing is acceptable due to the lack of contention in the common cases, I can simplify my patch by removing the addition of the per-session cache.

r=wtc.
Half way in the code review, I realized that this patch depends
on another patch, so I reviewed the patches in the wrong order.
The main problem with this patch is the need to hold a lock
across the two ssl3\_CallHelloExtensionSenders calls in
ssl3\_SendClientHello. Since this patch has some good ideas
and you may have lost the momentum on this patch after waiting
several weeks for my review, you should check in this patch
after fixing the problems I discovered. Note especially the
two comments marked with "IMPORTANT".
I have two ideas for solving the reader lock problem.
1. Figure out a way that allows us to call
ssl3\_CallHelloExtensionSenders only once. More on this below.
2. Change the NewSessionTicket struct to have a reference count,
and change the sessionTicket member of the sslSessionID struct
to be a pointer to NewSessionTicket. That pointer is protected
by the cache lock. Add a function that returns a reference to
the current NewSessionTicket in a given sid. ssl3\_SendClientHello
calls that function and stores the reference to NewSessionTicket
in a ss->ssl3.hs member, and ssl3\_SendSessionTicketXtn uses that
member.
These two ideas are independent of each other. Either of them
should solve the reader lock problem. Ideally we should do both
of them

Nit: The "When we attempt session resumption (only)" part of the

we are likely to implement a solution soon to avoid holding a
reader lock on sid->u.ssl3 across the two

All these PR\_RWLock\_Unlock calls on error returns are

I highly recommend that we make the second argument of

ss->ssl3.hs.newSessionTicket.ticket.data/len to NULL/0.

IMPORTANT: sid->cache is protected by the cache lock, so reading
sid->cached here is not thread-safe.
(Note: I can convince myself that testing sid->cached == never\_cached
might be thread-safe, but sid->cached == in\_client\_cache should be
tested with lock protection.)
I don't understand why you want to test if sid is in the client
cache. What matters is whether session\_ticket->ticket.data is
null or not, which we will test below. So I think we should simply

1. I also noticed this two-pass problem. At some point we should
figure out a way to call the extension senders in only one pass.
It requires a way to go back in ss->sec.ci.sendBuf.buf to fix up
the total length of extensions. Since ss->sec.ci.sendBuf.buf may
be reallocated for more space, it is a little tricky to figure out
the location for the total length of extensions in
ss->sec.ci.sendBuf.buf.

(In reply to Brian Smith from [comment #9](/show_bug.cgi?id=930874#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - TOCTOU, potential use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing due to lack of lock protecting the sessionTicket field of the sid"))
Brian:
Thank you for the research on session ticket renewal. I also looked into
this. Here are my findings.
1. NSS servers don't renew session tickets.
2. By default, OpenSSL servers don't renew session tickets. If a custom
session ticket key callback (tlsext\_ticket\_key\_cb) is used, the callback
may renew session tickets.
(I don't know whether Google servers renew session tickets during session
resumption. I'll ask Adam.)
Since a session has a recommended max lifetime of 24 hours, unless the
session ticket keys are rotated much more frequently than every 24 hours,
session tickets will be rarely renewed before the session expires in the
client session cache. This is why I thought a simple patch to drop support
for session ticket renewal would allow us to work around these bugs
quickly without much performance loss in practice.
But now I am in favor of forging ahead. I will review your other patches
next.

I think it is better to leave it as it is for now since we agree that we should find a solution that allows us to avoid calling ssl3\_CallHelloExtensionSenders twice. If I rewrote things to use goto now, then that would just add noise that would have to be undone when we fix the ssl3\_CallHelloExtensionSenders issue, which is now filed as [bug 947681](/show_bug.cgi?id=947681 "NEW - ssl3_CallHelloExtensionSenders should only be called once per hello message, not twice.").

I agree in/out arguments can be confusing. However, I think it is better to have ssl3\_SetSIDSessionTicket zero the argument (i.e. keep it in/out). With the way I wrote the patch, the worst that can happen if there is a bug elsewhere in the code is a null pointer dereference. Relying on the caller to zero pointers that it passes in leaves us open to more serious problems like use-after-free if there is a logic error in the calling code.

The reader/writer lock was used to minimize problems with holding the lock for longer than we'd like. We can consider changing it to a simple mutex after we fix [bug 947681](/show_bug.cgi?id=947681 "NEW - ssl3_CallHelloExtensionSenders should only be called once per hello message, not twice.").

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? It seems like it would be hard to build a working exploit because it would require precise control over the timing of operations in the network stack, which is hard to precisely control, or a lot of luck.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? It is pretty obvious that we're fixing a race condition by introducing locks.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? I want to land this patch in NSS 3.15.4 which is scheduled to go into Firefox 27. We can also update ESR branches to NSS 3.15.4 to get this fix.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? This patch is difficult to test because it requires precise control over the timing of the network stack to produce the race condition. I have written a coverage test, which is attached to this bug, with the goal of verifying that we don't do any dumb things like dereferencing a null pointer or anything like that.

This implements the suggestion in your last comment. I think this is what you meant, though it isn't exactly what you said.

We also need to exclude sid->cached == invalid\_cache. So it would be better to say "when the sid cannot be shared" or "when sid->cached is never\_cached".

We are not holding a reader lock for sid->u.ssl3.lock at this point, right?
I thought about this code a bit. I believe we should be able to remove this
code because we should not cache an SID that doesn't have a session ID or
session ticket.
Another thread-safety problem I noticed in this function is that it reads
sid->cached unprotected at the beginning of the function.

I think these thread-safety issues can be solved/clarified by ensuring that we only call ss->sec.cache() during full handshakes. We can then assert in the beginning of CacheSID: PORT\_Assert(sid->cached == never\_cached).
Regarding empty session ID length check: I will look at it.

I implemented idea 2 in my [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=930874#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - TOCTOU, potential use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing due to lack of lock protecting the sessionTicket field of the sid"). I will need to adjust this
patch after Brian lands his patches.
This patch avoids adding a per-session lock to sid.

I moved the new |sessionTicket| member from ss->sec.ci to ss->ssl3.hs
because it is used only during TLS/SSL3 handshakes.

These members are also modified when the sid is removed from the cache to release resources, and sid->cached == invalid\_cache in that case. So, I think that my comment is more accurate/clear. Feel free to make another suggestion if you still disagree.

I did make the change to PORT\_Assert(sid->cached == never\_cached).
We can't be holding the lock here because the lock isn't even created until after this point.
I didn't remove the empty session ID length check. It probably can be safely removed but it isn't completely obvious, because the session ID handling isn't very clear, and I remember bugs in the area of empty session IDs in OpenSSL 0.9.8(something).

Brian: these changes to sslcon.c are not in the NewSessionTicket-lock-2.patch that

I assume they are necessary because CacheSID now asserts sid->cached == never\_cached,

Yes, that is correct. case. I thought I had commented about this above, but I cannot find that comment. I made that change in response to your concerns about "Another thread-safety problem I noticed in this function is that it reads

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 78 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 69 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2016), [My Oracle Support Note 2072202.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2072202.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[Creating two TLS sessions with the same keys on different servers](attachment.cgi?id=826845)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=826845&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131025151332
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a TLS server supporting only the DHE key exchange.
2. During any handshake, send the parameters <p, g, g^q> where p=2q+1 is a prime such that q is also prime and g is not a quadratic residue mod p
3. NSS accepts this value and proceeds with the handshake. The PMS computed by NSS is g^(q\*Kc)
Actual results:
NSS accepts to proceed with the exchange. If g is not a quadratic residue mod p, then g^q = p-1 which is not rejected by NSS as it accepts any public value in [2, p-1] (this is allowed by rfc2631). Then, the computed PMS g^(q\*Kc) is 1 if Kc is even (because g^(2q)=g^(p-1)=1 [mod p]) and p-1 if Kc is odd (because g^q=p-1 [mod p]). If the server chose a Ks with the same parity, the PMS will be the same on the client and server but the communication is not safe because an attacker can derive it from the parameters sent over the network.
Expected results:
In itself, the impact of accepting <2p+1,g,g^p> is not too high, because these parameters are signed by the server certificate's public key and very few server will chose them.
However, our worry is the ability for a malicious website to send such parameters both to the client and to a victim server acting as man in the middle. This can allow a TLS session to the malicious server to be resumed on the victim server, which breaks Channel Bindings / Channel ID and can be combined with renegotiation in Chromium to break client authentication, among other things. This is discussed in Chrome bugs [305951, 306959, 305220] and is the main reason why this report should stay private for a short while.

Yes, this only protects the server (which chooses p itself), not the client. I believe that protecting the server is sufficient as it prevents an attacker from seeding a session with a chosen master key at both sides.
Primality testing would just be a sanity check in any case. Primality tests are fine for testing a random number but they are not adversarial checks. An attacker could still send a pseudoprime that passes the tests. An adversarial check would involve implementing the AKS test(?) and I suspect that wouldn't be sufficiently performant.

I might have missed something, but I think the issue with Chromium is that Chromoting uses a channel-binding like system for authentication and we need to bandaid it to prevent these session-fixation attacks. I think it falls somewhere like sec-medium for us.
I'm not sure whether this is an issue for Firefox.

On its own, this is not really a security issue, in fact all browsers currently accept at least one kind of degenerate parameters. However, it can become problematic when mixed with TLS level authentication features or other TLS bugs in Chromium. As far as we know there is no direct impact on Firefox.
[Comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=934545#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Do not allow p-1 as a public DH value") raises a very good point. It seems that with a probabilistic primality check, a malicious server can send a pseudo-prime and public key such that it passes all checks and results in a degenerate PMS. However, isn't it possible to instead check after receiving <p,g,g^Ks> that g^KcKs is not weak? What matters for an attacker is the PMS that the client stored, and the fact that the KDF in TLS has the bad idea to remove leading zeros from the PMS (which has the effect of making p and g irrelevant to its value).
Yet, a probabilistic check on the public server key is not completely useless, as it is always possible given <p,g,g^Ks> to create a q such that the parameters <q,g,g^Ks> result with high probability in the client storing a PMS of g^Ks (this is useful to a MITM because it can always have a server use this value as a PMS by sending g).
There are various ways to create such a q from legitimate parameters <p,g,K>. An easy one that we implemented and tested is q=K²-1. When Firefox or Chrome receives <K²-1,g,K> there is a high chance that K^Kc=K mod K²-1, and thus a PMS of K is stored. Thus, without a primality test, there is no real reason not to accept K=1 or K=p-1. TLS is also at fault for not including p and g in the PMS computation.

Only to an extent. [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=934545#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Do not allow p-1 as a public DH value") presents the following attack, let me elaborate:
S chooses (p, g, K = g^x) and sends it to A
A forwards (K^2-K, g, K) and sends it to C [i.e. it changes the p value to K^2-K]
C chooses g^y mod (K^2-K) and sends it to A
A forwards g to S
So, C and A will end up with pms = K^y mod (K^2 - K) = K
And A and S will end up with pms = K^1 = K
So even if the server is completely honest and does all its checks, A can force C to have the same master secret.
This attack works very well on Firefox and Chrome.
For some other clients (e.g. openssl), you have to ensure that the resulting prime is odd, or else the BN library crashes. In that case, A can find a K^z mod p value that is even (easy) and pick the p-value K^2 - 1.
If C picks an even y (50% chance), the attack still works as described above.
In summary, this means that absent full-primality checking at the client (which I understand is expensive),
DHE master secrets are completely at the mercy of the server. A server could advertise perfect forward secrecy
by accepting DHE cipher suites, but in fact force every single client to use the same premaster secret.

> that absent full-primality checking at the client (which I understand is expensive)
Sadly, it appears to be not just expensive, but infeasible:
AKS:
"Our implementation was able to determine primality for bitlengths on the order of 64 bits in a few hours"
<http://www.uploadtak.com/images/b3357_Salembier_Southering.pdf>
There appears to be a deterministic version of Miller-Rabin: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Rabin_primality_test>
However, the complexity of Õ((log n)4) does not sound like it's reasonable for ~2048-bit numbers.
So this line of inquiry appears to be nonsense. Let's fix session resumption to hash in a hash of the original handshake. Do you have a design for that lying around?
Off the top of my head, we can require the client and server to store the handshake hash of the original handshake in the session state. Then mix that into the master\_secret calculation with the nonces? Indicate with an extension and refuse to interoperate with servers that don't use the extension when doing something channel bindings like?

I agree, primality testing is out.
We have two designs we're trying out in openssl, both sound like something you're describing above.
1. An "extended master secret computation" extension, that computes the master secret as:
ms = prf(pms,"master secret",<hash of handshake log up to ClientCCS>)
2. A "secure resumption indication" extension that kicks in during session resumption only.
The session state/ticket stores the handshake hashes of the original handshake.
During resumption, the ClientHello and ServerHello echo the handshake hashes stored for the session.
It seems that there is support from the TLS WG and implementors (e.g. openssl) for one or both of these.
And both seem very easy to patch in to openssl, maybe also to NSS?
To fix renego and protocols using channel bindings (e.g. SASL), 2 may suffice.
I personally like 1, because I think it makes all handshakes safer and the crypto agility proofs easier.
(For every ciphersuite/protocol version/DH group/server cert, we are guaranteed a different key, so the possibility of cross protocol attacks and downgrade attacks diminishes.)
Plus, for PEAP and other protocols relying on the master secret being unique, 1 may be the only good option.

> So this line of inquiry appears to be nonsense.
Going back to the topic of this bug, we initially thought that with simple parameter validation, DHE could prevent the same PMS being used on different TLS connections.
Our conclusion is now that it is not the case, and in addition, clients are not guaranteed any secrecy of communications with a server that picks a bad DH group, even against a purely passive network attacker (such as the NSA) that doesn't control the server.
This is an interesting finding that should be documented for cases where it may matter, but as far as NSS is concerned, it seems nothing can be done. Thus, this bug can be closed and discussion continue on the relevant Chromium bugs.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 11 years agoResolution: --- → WONTFIX

(2) appears to be what I was thinking of, but I like (1) also. Hopefully we can bring ekr and other IETF folks to pick one. Both sound pretty easy to implement in NSS and I can do that if need be.

Adam, do you think that it isn't worth doing the bounds checking either? It seems strange that we already are checking these edge cases \*except\* for (p-1). If the bounds checking is worthless then we should at least add a comment about why we avoid doing the bounds checking even though SP800-56A "requires" it.

bsmith: I think the patch is probably independently a good idea. The rejection of zero and one was to address a cross-protocol attack by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos where a ServerKeyExchange for P384 ECDHE can be used in place of a DH ServerKeyExchange. p-1 wasn't a problem in that case and we didn't have the bigint library to hand. But we might as well land this change where we do.Flags: needinfo?(agl)

Right, It's still probably good to check for the degenerate groups, but checking for the small all subgroups is a bit much, so at some point we need to trust the pgy parameters sent by the server. DSA has a solution for this (generators to create pq and g).
The current thought in that world is that probabilistic prime checks are fine, but you need to either do a lot of them, or mix their types up to prevent well chosen psuedo-primes. FIPS -186-4 has recommendations for pqg checks for DSA, though DSA is easier because you are given q (such that p=k\*q+1, q is a prime of a minimum size), so its easy to check if g is in the subgroup q.

Attached patch

[patch v2, by Adam Langley](attachment.cgi?id=8346903&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8346903&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=934545&attachment=8346903)

Adam: I made the following changes.
1. |pMinus1| was renamed |psub1|, which is used in other freebl code.
2. Added CHECK\_MPI\_OK around the mp\_sub\_d call.
3. I merged the four comparisons:
Yb == 0, Yb == 1, Yb == p-1, Yb >= p
into just two:
Yb <= 1, Yb >= p-1.
This matches NIST SP 800-56A, Section 5.6.2.4, Step 1:
1. Verify that 2 <= y <= p-2.

Lowering security severity to moderate after discussing w/NSS folks. We will only accept a problematic p=1 parameter from servers who's cert we trust. They can mistakenly end up with a less secure channel than they intended but this isn't something an external party can use to attack Firefox users with (if the server you're talking to is malicious then the security of the TLS channel isn't your main problem).Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

While I agree this is a sec-moderate problem, I disagree with your assertion that "this isn't something an external party can use to attack Firefox users with". Key exchange messages are in the clear and if an eavesdropper sees a server sending p-1 in its ServerKeyExchange message, the connection can be decrypted.

I saw dkeeler landed NSS 3.15.4 on the ESR-24 branch so this should be fixed there.

This is what I meant by ending up with a less secure channel. If the trusted server is being stupid it could redirect to the non-SSL version of the site and be 100% in the clear. Yes, it affects Firefox users but it's more a bug in the server than an attack on Firefox.

Our concern is not really the publication of our paper in May but the fact that other libraries, such as SChannel (IE) or Secure Transport (Safari) have similar or worse problems with DH parameter validation. That being said, it's actually unlikely that Apple will fix this (we previously reported bigger issues with their TLS implementation that never got addressed) so it would make sense if you decided to patch this for FF27.Flags: needinfo?(antoine)

This is already patched. This is about whether or when we write a public advisory.

A patch like this one is as good as any advisory. I don't think it makes much sense to leave it out of the release notes when it's in the source code.

Not everything in the source code gets an advisory.
If you don't feel a need to keep it undisclosed while other vendors are vulnerable, we'll have a discussion about what we want to do with an advisory.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1477 CVE-2014-1479 CVE-2014-1481 CVE-2014-1482
                 CVE-2014-1486 CVE-2014-1487 CVE-2014-1490 CVE-2014-1491

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.

This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

[fix-NewSessionTicket.patch](attachment.cgi?id=822123&action=diff) (obsolete)

See <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077#section-3.3>:
"The client MUST NOT treat the ticket as valid until it has verified the server's Finished message."
This bug affects the case illustrated in figure 2 of RFC 5077, "Message Flow for Abbreviated Handshake Using New Session Ticket," where a NewSessionTicket message is sent during a session resumption, replacing the session ticket for a session already stored in the cache. That session may already be in use by other connections.
I am not sure if or how this bug could be exploited. However, I am not convinced it is unexploitable either, so I am hiding this bug for now. I suspect that, on its own, it is somewhat benign and may just result in DoS or poor performance. However, I think we should investigate further whether this could be used in conjunction with other attacks, either against us (the client) or against servers. Particularly, maybe incomplete verification of the ticket on the part of the server could result in [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3555)-like attacks when combined with this. Similarly, if there were some kind of session confusion issue on the client side, then this bug might make those issues worse.
\* The session ticket is unusual in that it is an updatable part of a session, where most session data is not updatable. If we ever expose the session ticket to applications so that applications can associate the exact ticket used with a connection (actually a particular handshake on the connection), then would need to maintain an independent copy of the ticket data in ss->ssl3.hs at all times, instead of \*moving\* it from ss->ssl3.hs to the sid like this patch does.
\* More alarmingly, there appear to be race conditions (TOCTOU, potentially use-after-free) to lack of locking around reads and updates of the session ticket within the sid. I am investigating this and will file another bug to fix that.

The server side of NSS's libssl does not ever send NewSessionTicket during a session resumption handshake. Consequently, the session resumption case has no test coverage.Whiteboard: [briansmith is unsure about the security rating] → [introduced in bug 403563][briansmith is unsure about the security rating]

fix-NewSessionTicket.patch [v2]
Wan-Teh, I see from the blame history that you were involved in the implementation of this feature in [bug 403563](/show_bug.cgi?id=403563 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement the TLS session ticket extension (STE)"). So, I think you are probably the best reviewer. You may know more why things are implemented the way they are.

(In reply to Brian Smith (:briansmith, was :bsmith; NEEDINFO me if you want a response) from [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=930857#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - NewSessionTicket handshake message in a resumption handshake replaces cached session's ticket before handshake is finished"))

In [bug 930874](/show_bug.cgi?id=930874 "RESOLVED FIXED - TOCTOU, potential use-after-free in libssl's session ticket processing due to lack of lock protecting the sessionTicket field of the sid"), [attachment 826383](/attachment.cgi?id=826383 "NewSessionTicket-lock-test.patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=826383&action=edit "NewSessionTicket-lock-test.patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=826383&action=diff "NewSessionTicket-lock-test.patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=930874&attachment=826383), I added a way to get \*some\* test coverage.

[NewSessionTicket-wait.patch [v4]](attachment.cgi?id=8344274&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8344274&action=edit)

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? The attacker would have to have extremely specialized knowledge and even then I'm not sure this is actually an exploitable problem.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? Yes, but I think an attacker would be left scratching his/her head trying to figure out how to exploit this. People who are interested in such things probably already know about this bug because it is obvious from just reading the TLS specification and comparing our implementation to what the spec says.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All of them.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? I want to land this in NSS 3.15.4 so that Firefox 27 and later will get this. We can update ESR to NSS 3.15.4 to get this fix.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? This patch is unlikely to cause regressions. Unfortunately, writing a proper test for this would seem to require a unjustifiably huge amount of effort. It is also something that is unreasonable to manually verify with real-world servers because it would usually require many hours or even over a day to reproduce one instance of this problem, unless you build a custom server to test this.

"sec-vector" is used when the underlying vulnerability is in some other software (e.g. the OS) and Firefox is the vector by which internet miscreants can reach those vulnerabilities.
