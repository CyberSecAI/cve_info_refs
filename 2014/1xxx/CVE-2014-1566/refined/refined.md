Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient URL normalization within Firefox for Android when handling `file:` URIs. Specifically, the `nsIIOService` used to resolve URLs does not properly remove redundant slashes in the path part of the URI. This leads to incorrect containment checks, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient URL Normalization:** The core issue is the failure to normalize file paths by removing redundant slashes.
*   **Incorrect Containment Check:** Due to the unnormalized paths, the browser's logic for verifying if a file is within an allowed directory fails. This allows accessing files that should be restricted, such as files in the application's profile directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By crafting a malicious link using the `file:` protocol with additional slashes, a user can be tricked into downloading sensitive data from the Firefox profile directory to the SD card.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The downloaded data can include private information such as cookies, which can be accessed by other applications on the device, potentially compromising user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Hyperlinks:** An attacker can embed a specially crafted `file:` protocol hyperlink in a website or other content, tricking the user to click on the link.
*   **Address Bar Manipulation:** Users directly inputting the malicious URI into the browser's address bar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Hyperlinks:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control hyperlinks that can be presented to the user. This could be through a malicious website, a compromised email, or other means.
*   **No special permissions:** No special permissions are needed on the user's device beyond the user having Firefox for Android installed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because `nsIFile.compare` uses a simple `strcmp` which doesn't account for the multiple slashes.
*   The fix involves normalizing the path within the `file` object with a `normalize()` call, ensuring that the path comparisons work as expected.
*  The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 31.1, 32, and SeaMonkey 2.29.

In summary, CVE-2014-1566 is a high-severity security vulnerability in Firefox for Android where a flaw in file URI handling allows attackers to bypass security restrictions and download sensitive user data.
