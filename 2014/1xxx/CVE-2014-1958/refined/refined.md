Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `DecodePSDPixels()` function within the `coders/psd.c` file of ImageMagick. This function is responsible for decoding Run-Length Encoded (RLE) data within PSD (Photoshop Document) image files.
*   The core issue is a boundary error during RLE decoding, which leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. This occurs when the `DecodePSDPixels()` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer size during the RLE decoding process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could cause a denial of service by triggering excessive memory consumption due to the overflow, leading to a crash or hang.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More seriously, the buffer overflow could be exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the ImageMagick program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted PSD Image:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PSD image containing malicious RLE encoded data designed to trigger the buffer overflow in the vulnerable `DecodePSDPixels()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver the malicious PSD image to a system that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could involve tricking a user or an automated system into opening or processing the image.

**Summary**

CVE-2014-1958 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick's PSD image decoding functionality.  By processing a malicious PSD image file, an attacker could trigger a buffer overflow, which may lead to denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
