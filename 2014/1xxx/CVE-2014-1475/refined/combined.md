Package        : drupal7
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1475 CVE-2014-1476

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a
fully-featured content management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2014-1475

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov reported a vulnerability
    in the OpenID module that allows a malicious user to log in as
    other users on the site, including administrators, and hijack
    their accounts.

CVE-2014-1476

    Matt Vance and Damien Tournoud reported an access bypass
    vulnerability in the taxonomy module. Under certain circumstances,
    unpublished content can appear on listing pages provided by the
    taxonomy module and will be visible to users who should not have
    permission to see it.

These fixes require extra updates to the database which can be done from
the administration pages. Furthermore this update introduces a new
security hardening element for the form API. Please refer to the
upstream advisory at <https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-001> for further
information.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : drupal6
Vulnerability  : impersonation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1475

Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov reported a vulnerability in the
OpenID module of Drupal, a fully-featured content management framework.
A malicious user could exploit this flaw to log in as other users on the
site, including administrators, and hijack their accounts.

These fixes require extra updates to the database which can be done from
the administration pages.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.30-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
