Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1560:

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-1560 is a vulnerability related to the handling of non-ASCII characters in SSL certificates within Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. Specifically, it involves an assertion failure due to unexpected non-ASCII characters during certificate processing.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the incorrect assumption that all names within SSL certificates would be in ASCII format. When a certificate contained a subject name with non-ASCII characters, an assertion failed within the `nsCharTraits.h` file during processing, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Character Encoding Assumption:** The code assumed that all certificate names would be encoded in ASCII format.
*   **Assertion Failure:** Upon encountering non-ASCII characters, the program crashed due to an assertion failure in `nsCharTraits.h`.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation**: The code didn't properly validate or handle non-ASCII characters in the subject's common name field of the certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash of the application upon encountering a crafted certificate with non-ASCII characters in the common name. This could prevent users from accessing websites requiring such certificates.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the primary impact is a crash, improper parsing of certificate data can potentially lead to other vulnerabilities, such as the bypass of certificate validation or other security checks. (This is not explicitly stated, but it's implied through the fact that these are security bugs. The vulnerability was also fixed alongside other UTF-8 handling issues that were classified as sec-moderate)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SSL Certificates:** An attacker could create a malicious website using a crafted SSL certificate with non-ASCII characters in the subject name.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker performing a MitM attack could inject a malicious certificate with non-ASCII characters, causing the client application to crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Create/Modify SSL Certificates:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify SSL certificates, for example, by running a malicious server.
*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to present the crafted certificate to a vulnerable client, either by hosting a malicious site, or by performing a MitM.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed by properly handling UTF-8 encoded characters in certificate names.
*   The issue was discovered during fuzzing, highlighting the importance of automated testing in finding security vulnerabilities.
*   The bug was initially introduced in 2008, highlighting the long existence of the vulnerability.
*   The severity was rated as "moderate" (sec-moderate), which was the same as related issues with UTF-8 strings
* The fix was applied in Firefox 31, and deemed not necessary to backport to Firefox ESR24 or Firefox 30, because Firefox 31 was the next ESR release
