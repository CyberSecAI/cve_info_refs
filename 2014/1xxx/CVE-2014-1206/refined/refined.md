Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-1206

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of the `owa_email_address` parameter on the password reset page of Open Web Analytics (OWA) v1.5.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the `owa_email_address` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Pre-Authentication Vulnerability:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication since the password reset page is accessible to anyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements within the context of the database user configured for OWA.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Loss:** Exploitation can lead to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the OWA database.
- **Underlying Database System Compromise:**  The vulnerability can potentially affect the entire underlying database management system.
- **Possible OS Compromise:** Under specific circumstances, this could also lead to operating system compromise.
- **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information like user credentials (e.g., password hashes).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** A specially crafted HTTP POST request containing malicious SQL code within the `owa_email_address` parameter is sent to the password reset page (`/owa/index.php?owa_do=base.passwordResetForm`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OWA instance.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the OWA application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to be knowledgeable about SQL to craft a malicious injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is demonstrated using a proof of concept, including a sample request and response demonstrating how to extract password hashes.
- A python script is provided to automate the exploitation process
- The vendor (Open Web Analytics) released version 1.5.5 to address this vulnerability
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dana James Traversie of Dell SecureWorks
- CVSS v2 base score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
