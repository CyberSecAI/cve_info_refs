Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from Firefox for Android's handling of `file:` protocol URIs. When a `file:` URI pointing to a location within the Firefox profile directory was accessed, the browser would attempt to download the referenced file to the device's SD card without any user prompt or warning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Automatic Download of Sensitive Files:** Firefox for Android automatically downloaded files from its profile directory when accessed via a `file:` URI.
*   **World-Readable SD Card:** The downloaded files were stored on the SD card, which is typically world-readable by other applications, leading to an information disclosure risk.
*   **Lack of User Prompt:** No prompt or warning was presented to the user before the file was downloaded.
*   **Bypass of Same-Origin Policy:** The ability to access and download local files within the profile directory using `file:` URIs could potentially bypass the browser's same-origin policy, granting access to sensitive data.
*   **Flawed Profile Salt:** (Related issue) The profile directory salt was flawed (see Bug 944373), making it easier for attackers to guess the path to the profile directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information stored within the Firefox profile directory, such as browsing history, cookies, passwords, databases (e.g., browser.db, times.json), and local storage.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious apps could automatically extract these sensitive files and transmit them to remote servers or use them for other malicious activities.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Users' privacy would be severely compromised due to the leakage of personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application on the user's Android device could exploit this vulnerability by:
    1.  Guessing the profile directory salt (related to Bug 944373).
    2.  Crafting a `file:` URI pointing to a sensitive file in the profile directory.
    3.  Sending an intent to Firefox to open that `file:` URI (e.g., via an iframe src attribute within a webpage loaded in the browser or through an Android intent).
    4.  Firefox automatically downloads the file to the SD card and attacker reads the contents.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** A malicious website could attempt the same attack by embedding an iframe with a `file:` URI to trigger the download

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Malicious App:** The attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the user's Android device.
*   **Profile Directory Knowledge:**  The attacker would need some knowledge of the Firefox profile directory path, which was made easier by a flawed salt generation mechanism for profile directories (see Bug 944373).
* **Ability to trigger an intent:** The attacker must be able to send an intent to the Firefox application. This could be done via a malicious application or web page.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by:

*   **Blocking downloads of files within the profile directory**: Firefox now refuses to download `file:` URIs that point to files within its profile directory. Instead a "Couldn't find an app to open this link" message is shown.
*   **Prompting for APK downloads:** Firefox will now always show a prompt for APK downloads

**Additional Information**
*   This bug is related to the flawed profile salt generation issue described in bug 944373
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 28.0.1 and later versions.
*   The bug report contains a discussion about potentially blacklisting specific file types in preferences. This was not implemented in the fix.
