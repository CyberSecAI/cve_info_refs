- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Upon each reboot, the permissions for the `/Users` and `/Users/Shared` directories were being set to world-writable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission handling on the `/Users` and `/Users/Shared` directories.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user could compromise other local user accounts by modifying the world-writable directories.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user account on the vulnerable system.
