# Re: CVE request: python-gnupg before 0.3.5 shell injection

```

We think either 3 or 4 may be a better number of CVEs.

First, it seems that the shell_quote function in version 0.3.5 has two
fundamentally different problems with different flaw types and
different discoverers. The code in question is:

  elif len(s) >= 2 and (s[0], s[-1]) == ("'", "'"):
      result = '"%s"' % s.replace('"', r'\"')

The first problem, noted by Florian Weimer, is that this type of
attempt to quote ' characters by using " characters is inherently
wrong because the " and ' characters are not equivalent in the shell.
In his example, the input ends up surrounded by " characters, but the
string inside has a $( command substitution, and thus the command will
be executed. In other words, using " characters simply cannot work
correctly because "$(command)" is unsafe whereas '$(command)' is safe.

The second problem, noted by Matthew Daley, is that arbitrary
insertion of a \ character into a string is unsafe because it can
convert a single command into a list. This is independent of the
non-equivalence of " and ' in the shell. In particular, the same list
vulnerability can be seen with this 0.3.5 code variant:

  elif len(s) >= 2 and (s[0], s[-1]) == ('"', '"'):
      result = "'%s'" % s.replace("'", r"\'")

along with the analogous variant of the Python input. The only
difference is that the shell prints a different number of \
characters. In each case, the erroneous \ insertion separates the
string into a list of two commands, and the touch command is executed.

Specifically, using the original 0.3.5 code:

  >>> print shell_quote("'\\\"; touch foo #'")
  "'\\"; touch foo #'"

  % ls foo
  ls: cannot access foo: No such file or directory
  % echo "'\\"; touch foo #'"
  '\
  % ls foo
  foo

Using the above 0.3.5 code variant:

  >>> print shell_quote('"\\\'; touch foo #"')
  '"\\'; touch foo #"'

  % rm foo
  % ls foo
  ls: cannot access foo: No such file or directory
  % echo '"\\'; touch foo #"'
  "\\
  % ls foo
  foo

So, the CVE assignments for these issues are:

  CVE-2013-7323 Unrestricted use of unquoted strings in a shell,
                within version 0.3.4

  CVE-2014-1927 Erroneous assumptions about the usability of "
                characters within version 0.3.5, leading to attacks
                such as $( command substitution within a "-quoted
                string

  CVE-2014-1928 Erroneous insertion of a \ character within version
                0.3.5, leading to attacks involving command lists
                (such as lists separated by a ; character)

Second, 0.3.5 and 0.3.6 have a series of differences in handling of
command-line arguments. This seems to be most likely a reaction to
Florian Weimer's observation of "you need to make sure that you
prevent option injection through positional arguments." Does anyone
believe that option injection was impossible in 0.3.5? If not, we will
make a fourth CVE assignment.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : python-gnupg
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7323 CVE-2014-1927 CVE-2014-1928 CVE-2014-1929

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the Python wrapper for the
Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG). Insufficient sanitising could lead to the
execution of arbitrary shell commands.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.6-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-gnupg packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

This fix appears to be incomplete:

>>> print shell_quote("'$(touch /tmp/I_was_here'")
"'$(touch /tmp/I_was_here'"

[fweimer@oldenburg ~]$ echo "'$(touch /tmp/I_was_here)'"
''
[fweimer@oldenburg ~]$ ls -l /tmp/I_was_here
-rw-rw-r--. 1 fweimer fweimer 0 Feb  4 11:12 /tmp/I_was_here

```
The proper way (at least if your shell runs in a UTF-8 or ISO-8859
locale) to escape shell arguments is to wrap them in '', after replacing
embedded ' characters with the four character sequence '\''. However,
using the subprocess module with shell=False (the default) is strongly
preferred.
```

```
In both cases, you need to make sure that you prevent option injection
through positional arguments. With a GNU getopt-derived command line
parser, option processing can be terminated with a -- argument.
(Warning: GnuPG does not strictly follow GNU command line processing
conventions.)
```

```
Is anyone in touch with the python-gpg folks and can rely this
information? Thanks.
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
