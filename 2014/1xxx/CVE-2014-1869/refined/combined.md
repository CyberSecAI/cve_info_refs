# Jenkins Security Advisory 2014-10-01

This advisory announces:

* multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.
* two security vulnerabilities found in [the monitoring plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)

## Description

### SECURITY-87/CVE-2014-3661 (anonymous DoS attack through CLI handshake)

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users with access to Jenkins' HTTP/HTTPS port to mount a DoS attack on Jenkins through thread exhaustion.

### SECURITY-110/CVE-2014-3662 (User name discovery)

Anonymous users can test if the user of a specific name exists or not through login attempts.

### SECURITY-127&128/CVE-2014-3663 (privilege escalation in job configuration permission)

An user with a permission limited to Job/CONFIGURE can exploit this vulnerability to effectively create a new job, which should have been only possible for users with Job/CREATE permission, or to destroy jobs that he/she does not have access otherwise.

### SECURITY-131/CVE-2014-3664 (directory traversal attack)

Users with Overall/READ permission can access arbitrary files in the file system readable by the Jenkins process, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information, such as encryption keys.

### SECURITY-138/CVE-2014-3680 (Password exposure in DOM)

If a parameterized job has a default value in a password field, that default value gets exposed to users with Job/READ permission.

### SECURITY-143/CVE-2014-3681 (XSS vulnerability in Jenkins core)

Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in Jenkins core. An attacker can navigate the user to a carefully crafted URL and have the user execute unintended actions.

### SECURITY-150/CVE-2014-3666 (remote code execution from CLI)

Unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by sending carefully crafted packets over the CLI channel.

### SECURITY-155/CVE-2014-3667 (exposure of plugin code)

Programs that constitute plugins can be downloaded by anyone with the Overall/READ permission, resulting in the exposure of otherwise sensitive information, such as hard-coded keys in plugins, if any.

### SECURITY-159/CVE-2013-2186 (arbitrary file system write)

Security vulnerability in commons fileupload allows unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to the Jenkins controller.

### SECURITY-149/CVE-2014-1869 (XSS vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard)

reflective XSS vulnerability in one of the library dependencies of Jenkins.

### SECURITY-113/CVE-2014-3678 (XSS vulnerabilities in monitoring plugin)

Monitoring plugin allows an attacker to cause a victim into executing unwanted actions on Jenkins instance.

### SECURITY-113/CVE-2014-3679 (hole in access control)

Certain pages in monitoring plugin are visible to anonymous users, allowing them to gain information that they are not supposed to.

## Severity

SECURITY-87 is rated **medium**, as it results in the loss of functionality.

SECURITY-110 is rated **medium**, as it results in a limited amount of information exposure.

SECURITY-127 and SECURITY-128 are rated **high**. The former can be used to further escalate privileges, and the latter results in loss of data.

SECURITY-131 and SECURITY-138 is rated **critical**. This vulnerabilities results in exposure of sensitie information and is easily exploitable.

SECURITY-143 is rated **high**. It is a passive attack, but it can result in a compromise of the Jenkins controller or loss of data.

SECURITY-150 is rated **critical**. This attack can be mounted by any unauthenticated anonymous user with HTTP reachability to Jenkins instance, and results in remote code execution on Jenkins.

SECURITY-155 is rated **medium**. This only affects users who have installed proprietary plugins on publicly accessible instances, which is relatively uncommon.

SECURITY-159 is rated **critical**. This attack can be mounted by any unauthenticated anonymous user with HTTP reachability to Jenkins instance.

SECURITY-113 is rated **high**. It is a passive attack, but it can result in a compromise of the Jenkins controller or loss of data.

## Affected Versions

* All the Jenkins releases ⇐ 1.582
* All the LTS releases ⇐ 1.565.2
* Monitoring plugin ⇐ 1.52.1

## Credit

The Jenkins project would like to thank the following people for finding the vulnerabilities:

* Daniel Beck for finding SECURITY-87, SECURITY-110, SECURITY-127, SECURITY-128
* Jesse Glick for finding SECURITY-131, SECURITY-155
* Matthias Schmalz for finding SECURITY-138
* Seth Graham for finding SECURITY-143
* Stephen Connolly for finding SECURITY-150
* Manfred Moser for finding SECURITY-159
* Wilder Rodrigues for finding SECURITY-113
* Kurt Seifried for finding SECURITY-149

## Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.583
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.565.3
* User of monitoring plugin should upgrade to 1.53

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

[@masatokinugawa](https://github.com/masatokinugawa) was so kind to email us about a security vulnerability.

This pull implements his suggestion of using a `replace(/\\/g,"\\\\")` instead of `split("\").join("\\")`

| Interesting and annoying. Big thanks to [@masatokinugawa](https://github.com/masatokinugawa), though!  I can write up a complementary PR for something I was working on locally, too, which ignores all `loaderInfo.parameters` whose keys are in the SWF query parameters. |

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise release 3.1.1 is now available with
updates to packages that fix several security issues, bugs and
introduce feature enhancements.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or
private cloud deployments.

The following security issues are addressed with this release:

An authorization flaw was discovered in Kubernetes; the API server
did not properly check user permissions when handling certain
requests. An authenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to
gain additional access to resources such as RAM and disk space.
(CVE-2016-1905)

An authorization flaw was discovered in Kubernetes; the API server
did not properly check user permissions when handling certain build-
configuration strategies. A remote attacker could create build
configurations with strategies that violate policy. Although the
attacker could not launch the build themselves (launch fails when
the policy is violated), if the build configuration files were later
launched by other privileged services (such as automated triggers),
user privileges could be bypassed allowing attacker escalation.
(CVE-2016-1906)

An update for Jenkins Continuous Integration Server that addresses a
large number of security issues including XSS, CSRF, information
disclosure and code execution have been addressed as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
