```
```
Package: python-jinja2
Version: 2.7.1-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

Default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache is /tmp.
This is insecure, because the directory is world-writable and filenames
that FileSystemBytecodeCache uses are of course predictable. As I
understand it, malicious local user could exploit this bug to execute
arbitrary code as another user.

Proof of concept is attached. If you put the __jinja2_*.cache file in
/tmp, and make it world-readable, then test-bccache.py will print "moo"
instead of "foo" (even when run by another user than the owner of the
cache file).

Hi,

Jinja 2.7.2 fixes this issue now:
<https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/J/Jinja2/Jinja2-2.7.2.tar.gz#md5=df1581455564e97010e38bc792012aa5>

It's not a super nice solution in that it creates a folder for the user, but it
should be good enough for the moment.  I will consider making the path explicit
in 2.8 which will put this issue to the forefront of users.

Regards,
Armin

```

that's why I added this patch:
<http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/jinja2/2.7.2-2/fix_CVE-2014-0012.patch>
see <http://bugs.debian.org/734956>

it's just a temporary fix - it practically disables caching so it's not
a long term solution (and that's why I didn't propose it as a fix in
Debian stable)

## Updated python-jinja2 package fixes two security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 24 Jan 2014

Modification date: 24 Jan 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-1402](CVE-2014-1402.html)

## Description

```
Updated python-jinja2 packages fix security vulnerability:

Jinja2, a template engine written in pure python, was found to use /tmp
as a default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache, which
is insecure because the /tmp directory is world-writable and the
filenames used like 'FileSystemBytecodeCache' are often predictable. A
malicious user could exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code as
another user. (CVE-2014-1402)

```

# Changes[¶](#changes "Link to this heading")

## Version 3.1.5[¶](#version-3-1-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-12-21

* The sandboxed environment handles indirect calls to `str.format`, such as
  by passing a stored reference to a filter that calls its argument.
  [GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h)
* Escape template name before formatting it into error messages, to avoid
  issues with names that contain f-string syntax.
  [#1792](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1792), [GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699)
* Sandbox does not allow `clear` and `pop` on known mutable sequence
  types. [#2032](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2032)
* Calling sync `render` for an async template uses `asyncio.run`.
  [#1952](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1952)
* Avoid unclosed `auto_aiter` warnings. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Return an `aclose`-able `AsyncGenerator` from
  `Template.generate_async`. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Avoid leaving `root_render_func()` unclosed in
  `Template.generate_async`. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Avoid leaving async generators unclosed in blocks, includes and extends.
  [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* The runtime uses the correct `concat` function for the current environment
  when calling block references. [#1701](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1701)
* Make `|unique` async-aware, allowing it to be used after another
  async-aware filter. [#1781](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1781)
* `|int` filter handles `OverflowError` from scientific notation.
  [#1921](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1921)
* Make compiling deterministic for tuple unpacking in a `{% set ... %}`
  call. [#2021](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2021)
* Fix dunder protocol (`copy`/`pickle`/etc) interaction with `Undefined`
  objects. [#2025](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2025)
* Fix `copy`/`pickle` support for the internal `missing` object.
  [#2027](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2027)
* `Environment.overlay(enable_async)` is applied correctly. [#2061](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/2061)
* The error message from `FileSystemLoader` includes the paths that were
  searched. [#1661](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1661)
* `PackageLoader` shows a clearer error message when the package does not
  contain the templates directory. [#1705](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1705)
* Improve annotations for methods returning copies. [#1880](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1880)
* `urlize` does not add `mailto:` to values like `@a@b`. [#1870](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1870)
* Tests decorated with `@pass_context`` can be used with the `|select`
  filter. [#1624](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1624)
* Using `set` for multiple assignment (`a, b = 1, 2`) does not fail when the
  target is a namespace attribute. [#1413](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1413)
* Using `set` in all branches of `{% if %}{% elif %}{% else %}` blocks
  does not cause the variable to be considered initially undefined.
  [#1253](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1253)

## Version 3.1.4[¶](#version-3-1-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2024-05-05

* The `xmlattr` filter does not allow keys with `/` solidus, `>`
  greater-than sign, or `=` equals sign, in addition to disallowing spaces.
  Regardless of any validation done by Jinja, user input should never be used
  as keys to this filter, or must be separately validated first.
  [GHSA-h75v-3vvj-5mfj](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-h75v-3vvj-5mfj)

## Version 3.1.3[¶](#version-3-1-3 "Link to this heading")

* Make error messages stemming from invalid nesting of `{% trans %}` blocks
  more helpful. [#1918](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1918)

## Version 3.1.2[¶](#version-3-1-2 "Link to this heading")

  [#1637](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1637)

## Version 3.1.0[¶](#version-3-1-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2022-03-24

* Drop support for Python 3.6. [#1534](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1534)
* Remove previously deprecated code. [#1544](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1544)

  + `WithExtension` and `AutoEscapeExtension` are built-in now.
  + `contextfilter` and `contextfunction` are replaced by
    `pass_context`. `evalcontextfilter` and
    `evalcontextfunction` are replaced by `pass_eval_context`.
    `environmentfilter` and `environmentfunction` are replaced
    by `pass_environment`.
  + `Markup` and `escape` should be imported from MarkupSafe.
  + Compiled templates from very old Jinja versions may need to be
    recompiled.
  + Legacy resolve mode for `Context` subclasses is no longer
    supported. Override `resolve_or_missing` instead of
    `resolve`.
  + `unicode_urlencode` is renamed to `url_quote`.
* Add support for native types in macros. [#1510](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1510)
* The `{% trans %}` tag can use `pgettext` and `npgettext` by
  passing a context string as the first token in the tag, like
  `{% trans "title" %}`. [#1430](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1430)
* Update valid identifier characters from Python 3.6 to 3.7.
  [#1571](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1571)
* Filters and tests decorated with `@async_variant` are pickleable.
  [#1612](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1612)

* Subscriptions (`[0]`, etc.) can be used after filters, tests, and
  calls when the environment is in async mode. [#1573](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1573)
* The `groupby` filter is case-insensitive by default, matching
  other comparison filters. Added the `case_sensitive` parameter to
  control this. [#1463](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1463)
* Windows drive-relative path segments in template names will not
  result in `FileSystemLoader` and `PackageLoader` loading from
  drive-relative paths. [#1621](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1621)

## Version 3.0.3[¶](#version-3-0-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-11-09

* Fix traceback rewriting internals for Python 3.10 and 3.11.
  [#1535](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1535)
* Fix how the native environment treats leading and trailing spaces
  when parsing values on Python 3.10. [#1537](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1537)
* Improve async performance by avoiding checks for common types.
  [#1514](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1514)
* Revert change to `hash(Node)` behavior. Nodes are hashed by id

* `PackageLoader` works when the package is a single module file.
  [#1512](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1512)

## Version 3.0.2[¶](#version-3-0-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-10-04

* Fix a loop scoping bug that caused assignments in nested loops
  to still be referenced outside of it. [#1427](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1427)
* Make `compile_templates` deterministic for filter and import
  names. [#1452, 1453](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1452%2C%201453)
* Revert an unintended change that caused `Undefined` to act like
  `StrictUndefined` for the `in` operator. [#1448](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1448)
* Imported macros have access to the current template globals in async
  environments. [#1494](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1494)
* `PackageLoader` will not include a current directory (.) path
  segment. This allows loading templates from the root of a zip
  import. [#1467](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1467)

## Version 3.0.1[¶](#version-3-0-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-18

* Update MarkupSafe dependency to >= 2.0. [#1418](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1418)
* Mark top-level names as exported so type checking understands
  imports in user projects. [#1426](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1426)
* Fix some types that weren’t available in Python 3.6.0. [#1433](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1433)
* The deprecation warning for unneeded `autoescape` and `with_`
  extensions shows more relevant context. [#1429](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1429)
* Fixed calling deprecated `jinja2.Markup` without an argument.
  Use `markupsafe.Markup` instead. [#1438](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1438)
* Calling sync `render` for an async template uses `asyncio.new_event_loop`
  This fixes a deprecation that Python 3.10 introduces. [#1443](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1443)

## Version 3.0.0[¶](#version-3-0-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-05-11

* Drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.5.
* Bump MarkupSafe dependency to >=1.1.
* Bump Babel optional dependency to >=2.1.
* Remove code that was marked deprecated.
* Add type hinting. [#1412](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1412)
* Use [**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) API to load templates with
  [`PackageLoader`](../api/#jinja2.PackageLoader "jinja2.loaders.PackageLoader"). [#1168](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1168)
* Fix a bug that caused imported macros to not have access to the
  current template’s globals. [#688](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/688)
* Add ability to ignore `trim_blocks` using `+%}`. [#1036](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1036)
* Fix a bug that caused custom async-only filters to fail with
  constant input. [#1279](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1279)
* Fix UndefinedError incorrectly being thrown on an undefined variable
  instead of `Undefined` being returned on
  `NativeEnvironment` on Python 3.10. [#1335](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1335)
* Blocks can be marked as `required`. They must be overridden at
  some point, but not necessarily by the direct child. [#1147](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1147)
* Deprecate the `autoescape` and `with` extensions, they are
  built-in to the compiler. [#1203](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1203)
* The `urlize` filter recognizes `mailto:` links and takes
  `extra_schemes` (or `env.policies["urlize.extra_schemes"]`) to
  recognize other schemes. It tries to balance parentheses within a
  URL instead of ignoring trailing characters. The parsing in general
  has been updated to be more efficient and match more cases. URLs
  without a scheme are linked as `https://` instead of `http://`.
  [#522, 827, 1172](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/522%2C%20827%2C%201172), [#1195](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1195)
* Filters that get attributes, such as `map` and `groupby`, can
  use a false or empty value as a default. [#1331](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1331)
* Fix a bug that prevented variables set in blocks or loops from
  being accessed in custom context functions. [#768](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/768)
* Fix a bug that caused scoped blocks from accessing special loop
  variables. [#1088](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1088)
* Update the template globals when calling
  `Environment.get_template(globals=...)` even if the template was
  already loaded. [#295](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/295)
* Do not raise an error for undefined filters in unexecuted
  if-statements and conditional expressions. [#842](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/842)
* Add `is filter` and `is test` tests to test if a name is a
  registered filter or test. This allows checking if a filter is
  available in a template before using it. Test functions can be
  decorated with `@pass_environment`, `@pass_eval_context`,
  or `@pass_context`. [#842](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/842), [#1248](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1248)
* Support `pgettext` and `npgettext` (message contexts) in i18n
  extension. [#441](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/441)
* The `|indent` filter’s `width` argument can be a string to
  indent by. [#1167](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1167)
* The parser understands hex, octal, and binary integer literals.
  [#1170](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1170)
* `Undefined.__contains__` (`in`) raises an `UndefinedError`
  instead of a `TypeError`. [#1198](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1198)
* `Undefined` is iterable in an async environment. [#1294](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1294)
* `NativeEnvironment` supports async mode. [#1362](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1362)
* Template rendering only treats `\n`, `\r\n` and `\r` as line
  breaks. Other characters are left unchanged. [#769, 952, 1313](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/769%2C%20952%2C%201313)
* `|groupby` filter takes an optional `default` argument.
  [#1359](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1359)
* The function and filter decorators have been renamed and unified.
  The old names are deprecated. [#1381](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1381)

  + `pass_context` replaces `contextfunction` and
    `contextfilter`.
  + `pass_eval_context` replaces `evalcontextfunction` and
    `evalcontextfilter`
  + `pass_environment` replaces `environmentfunction` and
    `environmentfilter`.
* Async support no longer requires Jinja to patch itself. It must
  still be enabled with `Environment(enable_async=True)`.
  [#1390](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1390)
* Overriding `Context.resolve` is deprecated, override
  `resolve_or_missing` instead. [#1380](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1380)

## Version 2.11.3[¶](#version-2-11-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2021-01-31

* Improve the speed of the `urlize` filter by reducing regex
  backtracking. Email matching requires a word character at the start
  of the domain part, and only word characters in the TLD. [#1343](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1343)

## Version 2.11.2[¶](#version-2-11-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2020-04-13

* Fix a bug that caused callable objects with `__getattr__`, like
  [`Mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock "(in Python v3.13)") to be treated as a
  `contextfunction()`. [#1145](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1145)
* Update `wordcount` filter to trigger [`Undefined`](../api/#jinja2.Undefined "jinja2.Undefined") methods
  by wrapping the input in `soft_str()`. [#1160](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1160)
* Fix a hang when displaying tracebacks on Python 32-bit.
  [#1162](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1162)
* Showing an undefined error for an object that raises
  `AttributeError` on access doesn’t cause a recursion error.
  [#1177](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1177)
* Revert changes to [`PackageLoader`](../api/#jinja2.PackageLoader "jinja2.loaders.PackageLoader") from 2.10 which
  removed the dependency on setuptools and pkg\_resources, and added
  limited support for namespace packages. The changes caused issues
  when using Pytest. Due to the difficulty in supporting Python 2 and
  [**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/) simultaneously, the changes are reverted until 3.0.
  [#1182](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1182)
* Fix line numbers in error messages when newlines are stripped.
  [#1178](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1178)
* The special `namespace()` assignment object in templates works in
  async environments. [#1180](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1180)
* Fix whitespace being removed before tags in the middle of lines when
  `lstrip_blocks` is enabled. [#1138](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1138)
* [`NativeEnvironment`](../nativetypes/#jinja2.nativetypes.NativeEnvironment "jinja2.nativetypes.NativeEnvironment") doesn’t evaluate
  intermediate strings during rendering. This prevents early
  evaluation which could change the value of an expression.
  [#1186](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1186)

## Version 2.11.1[¶](#version-2-11-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2020-01-30

* Fix a bug that prevented looking up a key after an attribute
  (`{{ data.items[1:] }}`) in an async template. [#1141](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1141)

## Version 2.11.0[¶](#version-2-11-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2020-01-27

* Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4. This will be the last
  version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.
* Added a new `ChainableUndefined` class to support getitem and
  getattr on an undefined object. [#977](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/977)
* Allow `{%+` syntax (with NOP behavior) when `lstrip_blocks` is
  disabled. [#748](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/748)
* Added a `default` parameter for the `map` filter. [#557](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/557)
* Exclude environment globals from
  [`meta.find_undeclared_variables()`](../api/#jinja2.meta.find_undeclared_variables "jinja2.meta.find_undeclared_variables"). [#931](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/931)
* Float literals can be written with scientific notation, like
  2.56e-3. [#912](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/912), [#922](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/922)
* Int and float literals can be written with the ‘\_’ separator for
  legibility, like 12\_345. [#923](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/923)
* Fix a bug causing deadlocks in `LRUCache.setdefault`. [#1000](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1000)
* The `trim` filter takes an optional string of characters to trim.
  [#828](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/828)
* A new `jinja2.ext.debug` extension adds a `{% debug %}` tag to
  quickly dump the current context and available filters and tests.
  [#174](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/174), [#798, 983](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/798%2C%20983)
* Lexing templates with large amounts of whitespace is much faster.
  [#857](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/857), [#858](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/858)
* Parentheses around comparisons are preserved, so
  `{{ 2 * (3 < 5) }}` outputs “2” instead of “False”.
  [#755](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/755), [#938](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/938)
* Add new `boolean`, `false`, `true`, `integer` and `float`
  tests. [#824](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/824)
* The environment’s `finalize` function is only applied to the
  output of expressions (constant or not), not static template data.
  [#63](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/63)
* When providing multiple paths to `FileSystemLoader`, a template
  can have the same name as a directory. [#821](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/821)
* Always return [`Undefined`](../api/#jinja2.Undefined "jinja2.Undefined") when omitting the `else` clause
  in a `{{ 'foo' if bar }}` expression, regardless of the
  environment’s `undefined` class. Omitting the `else` clause is a
  valid shortcut and should not raise an error when using
  [`StrictUndefined`](../api/#jinja2.StrictUndefined "jinja2.StrictUndefined"). [#710](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/710), [#1079](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1079)
* Fix behavior of `loop` control variables such as `length` and
  `revindex0` when looping over a generator. [#459, 751, 794](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/459%2C%20751%2C%20794),
  [#993](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/993)
* Async support is only loaded the first time an environment enables
  it, in order to avoid a slow initial import. [#765](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/765)
* In async environments, the `|map` filter will await the filter
  call if needed. [#913](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/913)
* In for loops that access `loop` attributes, the iterator is not
  advanced ahead of the current iteration unless `length`,
  `revindex`, `nextitem`, or `last` are accessed. This makes it
  less likely to break `groupby` results. [#555](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/555), [#1101](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1101)
* In async environments, the `loop` attributes `length` and
  `revindex` work for async iterators. [#1101](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1101)
* In async environments, values from attribute/property access will
  be awaited if needed. [#1101](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1101)
* `PackageLoader` doesn’t depend on setuptools or
  pkg\_resources. [#970](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/970)
* `PackageLoader` has limited support for [**PEP 420**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) namespace
  packages. [#1097](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1097)
* Support [`os.PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike "(in Python v3.13)") objects in
  `FileSystemLoader` and `ModuleLoader`.
  [#870](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/870)
* [`NativeTemplate`](../nativetypes/#jinja2.nativetypes.NativeTemplate "jinja2.nativetypes.NativeTemplate") correctly handles quotes
  between expressions. `"'{{ a }}', '{{ b }}'"` renders as the tuple
  `('1', '2')` rather than the string `'1, 2'`. [#1020](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1020)
* Creating a [`NativeTemplate`](../nativetypes/#jinja2.nativetypes.NativeTemplate "jinja2.nativetypes.NativeTemplate") directly creates a
  [`NativeEnvironment`](../nativetypes/#jinja2.nativetypes.NativeEnvironment "jinja2.nativetypes.NativeEnvironment") instead of a default
  [`Environment`](../api/#jinja2.Environment "jinja2.Environment"). [#1091](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1091)
* After calling `LRUCache.copy()`, the copy’s queue methods point to
  the correct queue. [#843](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/843)
* Compiling templates always writes UTF-8 instead of defaulting to the
  system encoding. [#889](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/889)
* `|wordwrap` filter treats existing newlines as separate paragraphs
  to be wrapped individually, rather than creating short intermediate
  lines. [#175](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/175)
* Add `break_on_hyphens` parameter to `|wordwrap` filter.
  [#550](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/550)
* Cython compiled functions decorated as context functions will be
  passed the context. [#1108](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1108)
* When chained comparisons of constants are evaluated at compile time,
  the result follows Python’s behavior of returning `False` if any
  comparison returns `False`, rather than only the last one.
  [#1102](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1102)
* Tracebacks for exceptions in templates show the correct line numbers
  and source for Python >= 3.7. [#1104](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1104)
* Tracebacks for template syntax errors in Python 3 no longer show
  internal compiler frames. [#763](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/763)
* Add a `DerivedContextReference` node that can be used by
  extensions to get the current context and local variables such as
  `loop`. [#860](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/860)
* Constant folding during compilation is applied to some node types
  that were previously overlooked. [#733](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/733)
* `TemplateSyntaxError.source` is not empty when raised from an
  included template. [#457](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/457)
* Passing an `Undefined` value to `get_template` (such as through
  `extends`, `import`, or `include`), raises an
  `UndefinedError` consistently. `select_template` will show the
  undefined message in the list of attempts rather than the empty
  string. [#1037](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1037)
* `TemplateSyntaxError` can be pickled. [#1117](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1117)

## Version 2.10.3[¶](#version-2-10-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-10-04

* Fix a typo in Babel entry point in `setup.py` that was preventing
  installation.

## Version 2.10.2[¶](#version-2-10-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-10-04

* Fix Python 3.7 deprecation warnings.
* Using `range` in the sandboxed environment uses `xrange` on
  Python 2 to avoid memory use. [#933](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/933)
* Use Python 3.7’s better traceback support to avoid a core dump when
  using debug builds of Python 3.7. [#1050](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1050)

## Version 2.10.1[¶](#version-2-10-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2019-04-06

* `SandboxedEnvironment` securely handles `str.format_map` in
  order to prevent code execution through untrusted format strings.
  The sandbox already handled `str.format`.

## Version 2.10[¶](#version-2-10 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-11-08

* Added a new extension node called `OverlayScope` which can be used
  to create an unoptimized scope that will look up all variables from
  a derived context.
* Added an `in` test that works like the in operator. This can be
  used in combination with `reject` and `select`.
* Added `previtem` and `nextitem` to loop contexts, providing
  access to the previous/next item in the loop. If such an item does
  not exist, the value is undefined.
* Added `changed(*values)` to loop contexts, providing an easy way
  of checking whether a value has changed since the last iteration (or
  rather since the last call of the method)
* Added a `namespace` function that creates a special object which
  allows attribute assignment using the `set` tag. This can be used
  to carry data across scopes, e.g. from a loop body to code that
  comes after the loop.
* Added a `trimmed` modifier to `{% trans %}` to strip linebreaks
  and surrounding whitespace. Also added a new policy to enable this
  for all `trans` blocks.
* The `random` filter is no longer incorrectly constant folded and
  will produce a new random choice each time the template is rendered.
  [#478](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/478)
* Added a `unique` filter. [#469](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/469)
* Added `min` and `max` filters. [#475](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/475)
* Added tests for all comparison operators: `eq`, `ne`, `lt`,
  `le`, `gt`, `ge`. [#665](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/665)
* `import` statement cannot end with a trailing comma. [#617](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/617),
  [#618](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/618)
* `indent` filter will not indent blank lines by default. [#685](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/685)
* Add `reverse` argument for `dictsort` filter. [#692](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/692)
* Add a `NativeEnvironment` that renders templates to native Python
  types instead of strings. [#708](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/708)
* Added filter support to the block `set` tag. [#489](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/489)
* `tojson` filter marks output as safe to match documented behavior.
  [#718](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/718)
* Resolved a bug where getting debug locals for tracebacks could
  modify template context.
* Fixed a bug where having many `{% elif ... %}` blocks resulted in
  a “too many levels of indentation” error. These blocks now compile
  to native `elif ..:` instead of `else: if ..:` [#759](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/759)

## Version 2.9.6[¶](#version-2-9-6 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-04-03

* Fixed custom context behavior in fast resolve mode [#675](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/675)

## Version 2.9.5[¶](#version-2-9-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-28

* Restored the original repr of the internal `_GroupTuple` because
  this caused issues with ansible and it was an unintended change.
  [#654](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/654)
* Added back support for custom contexts that override the old
  `resolve` method since it was hard for people to spot that this
  could cause a regression.
* Correctly use the buffer for the else block of for loops. This
  caused invalid syntax errors to be caused on 2.x and completely
  wrong behavior on Python 3 [#669](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/669)
* Resolve an issue where the `{% extends %}` tag could not be used
  with async environments. [#668](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/668)
* Reduce memory footprint slightly by reducing our unicode database
  dump we use for identifier matching on Python 3 [#666](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/666)
* Fixed autoescaping not working for macros in async compilation mode.
  [#671](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/671)

## Version 2.9.4[¶](#version-2-9-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-10

* Solved some warnings for string literals. [#646](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/646)
* Increment the bytecode cache version which was not done due to an
  oversight before.
* Corrected bad code generation and scoping for filtered loops.
  [#649](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/649)
* Resolved an issue where top-level output silencing after known
  extend blocks could generate invalid code when blocks where
  contained in if statements. [#651](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/651)
* Made the `truncate.leeway` default configurable to improve
  compatibility with older templates.

## Version 2.9.3[¶](#version-2-9-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-08

* Restored the use of blocks in macros to the extend that was possible
  before. On Python 3 it would render a generator repr instead of the
  block contents. [#645](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/645)
* Set a consistent behavior for assigning of variables in inner scopes
  when the variable is also read from an outer scope. This now sets
  the intended behavior in all situations however it does not restore
  the old behavior where limited assignments to outer scopes was
  possible. For more information and a discussion see [#641](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/641)
* Resolved an issue where `block scoped` would not take advantage of
  the new scoping rules. In some more exotic cases a variable
  overridden in a local scope would not make it into a block.
* Change the code generation of the `with` statement to be in line
  with the new scoping rules. This resolves some unlikely bugs in edge
  cases. This also introduces a new internal `With` node that can be
  used by extensions.

## Version 2.9.2[¶](#version-2-9-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-08

* Fixed a regression that caused for loops to not be able to use the
  same variable for the target as well as source iterator.
  [#640](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/640)
* Add support for a previously unknown behavior of macros. It used to
  be possible in some circumstances to explicitly provide a caller
  argument to macros. While badly buggy and unintended it turns out
  that this is a common case that gets copy pasted around. To not
  completely break backwards compatibility with the most common cases
  it’s now possible to provide an explicit keyword argument for caller
  if it’s given an explicit default. [#642](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/642)

## Version 2.9.1[¶](#version-2-9-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-07

* Resolved a regression with call block scoping for macros. Nested
  caller blocks that used the same identifiers as outer macros could
  refer to the wrong variable incorrectly.

## Version 2.9[¶](#version-2-9 "Link to this heading")

Released 2017-01-07, codename Derivation

* Change cache key definition in environment. This fixes a performance
  regression introduced in 2.8.
* Added support for `generator_stop` on supported Python versions
  (Python 3.5 and later)
* Corrected a long standing issue with operator precedence of math
  operations not being what was expected.
* Added support for Python 3.6 async iterators through a new async
  mode.
* Added policies for filter defaults and similar things.
* Urlize now sets “rel noopener” by default.
* Support attribute fallback for old-style classes in 2.x.
* Support toplevel set statements in extend situations.
* Restored behavior of Cycler for Python 3 users.
* Subtraction now follows the same behavior as other operators on
  undefined values.
* `map` and friends will now give better error messages if you
  forgot to quote the parameter.
* Depend on MarkupSafe 0.23 or higher.
* Improved the `truncate` filter to support better truncation in
  case the string is barely truncated at all.
* Change the logic for macro autoescaping to be based on the runtime
  autoescaping information at call time instead of macro define time.
* Ported a modified version of the `tojson` filter from Flask to
  Jinja and hooked it up with the new policy framework.
* Block sets are now marked `safe` by default.
* On Python 2 the asciification of ASCII strings can now be disabled
  with the `compiler.ascii_str` policy.
* Tests now no longer accept an arbitrary expression as first argument
  but a restricted one. This means that you can now properly use
  multiple tests in one expression without extra parentheses. In
  particular you can now write `foo is divisibleby 2 or foo is
  divisibleby 3` as you would expect.
* Greatly changed the scoping system to be more consistent with what
  template designers and developers expect. There is now no more magic
  difference between the different include and import constructs.
  Context is now always propagated the same way. The only remaining
  differences is the defaults for `with context` and `without
  context`.
* The `with` and `autoescape` tags are now built-in.
* Added the new `select_autoescape` function which helps configuring
  better autoescaping easier.
* Fixed a runtime error in the sandbox when attributes of async
  generators were accessed.

## Version 2.8.1[¶](#version-2-8-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2016-12-29

* Fixed the `for_qs` flag for `urlencode`.
* Fixed regression when applying `int` to non-string values.
* SECURITY: if the sandbox mode is used format expressions are now
  sandboxed with the same rules as in Jinja. This solves various
  information leakage problems that can occur with format strings.

## Version 2.8[¶](#version-2-8 "Link to this heading")

Released 2015-07-26, codename Replacement

* Added `target` parameter to urlize function.
* Added support for `followsymlinks` to the file system loader.
* The truncate filter now counts the length.
* Added equalto filter that helps with select filters.
* Changed cache keys to use absolute file names if available instead
  of load names.
* Fixed loop length calculation for some iterators.
* Changed how Jinja enforces strings to be native strings in Python 2
  to work when people break their default encoding.
* Added `make_logging_undefined` which returns an undefined
  object that logs failures into a logger.
* If unmarshalling of cached data fails the template will be reloaded
  now.
* Implemented a block `set` tag.
* Default cache size was increased to 400 from a low 50.
* Fixed `is number` test to accept long integers in all Python
  versions.
* Changed `is number` to accept Decimal as a number.
* Added a check for default arguments followed by non-default
  arguments. This change makes `{% macro m(x, y=1, z) %}` a syntax
  error. The previous behavior for this code was broken anyway
  (resulting in the default value being applied to `y`).
* Add ability to use custom subclasses of
  `jinja2.compiler.CodeGenerator` and `jinja2.runtime.Context` by
  adding two new attributes to the environment
  (`code_generator_class` and `context_class`). [#404](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/404)
* Added support for context/environment/evalctx decorator functions on
  the finalize callback of the environment.
* Escape query strings for urlencode properly. Previously slashes were
  not escaped in that place.
* Add ‘base’ parameter to ‘int’ filter.

## Version 2.7.3[¶](#version-2-7-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2014-06-06

* Security issue: Corrected the security fix for the cache folder.
  This fix was provided by RedHat.

## Version 2.7.2[¶](#version-2-7-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2014-01-10

* Prefix loader was not forwarding the locals properly to inner
  loaders. This is now fixed.
* Security issue: Changed the default folder for the filesystem cache
  to be user specific and read and write protected on UNIX systems.
  See [Debian bug 734747](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734747) for more information.

## Version 2.7.1[¶](#version-2-7-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-08-07

* Fixed a bug with `call_filter` not working properly on environment
  and context filters.
* Fixed lack of Python 3 support for bytecode caches.
* Reverted support for defining blocks in included templates as this
  broke existing templates for users.
* Fixed some warnings with hashing of undefineds and nodes if Python
  is run with warnings for Python 3.
* Added support for properly hashing undefined objects.
* Fixed a bug with the title filter not working on already uppercase
  strings.

## Version 2.7[¶](#version-2-7 "Link to this heading")

Released 2013-05-20, codename Translation

* Choice and prefix loaders now dispatch source and template lookup
  separately in order to work in combination with module loaders as
  advertised.
* Fixed filesizeformat.
* Added a non-silent option for babel extraction.
* Added `urlencode` filter that automatically quotes values for URL
  safe usage with utf-8 as only supported encoding. If applications
  want to change this encoding they can override the filter.
* Added `keep-trailing-newline` configuration to environments and
  templates to optionally preserve the final trailing newline.
* Accessing `last` on the loop context no longer causes the iterator
  to be consumed into a list.
* Python requirement changed: 2.6, 2.7 or >= 3.3 are required now,
  supported by same source code, using the “six” compatibility
  library.
* Allow `contextfunction` and other decorators to be applied to
  `__call__`.
* Added support for changing from newline to different signs in the
  `wordwrap` filter.
* Added support for ignoring memcache errors silently.
* Added support for keeping the trailing newline in templates.
* Added finer grained support for stripping whitespace on the left
  side of blocks.
* Added `map`, `select`, `reject`, `selectattr` and
  `rejectattr` filters.
* Added support for `loop.depth` to figure out how deep inside a
  recursive loop the code is.
* Disabled py\_compile for pypy and python 3.

## Version 2.6[¶](#version-2-6 "Link to this heading")

Released 2011-07-24, codename Convolution

* Internal attributes now raise an internal attribute error now
  instead of returning an undefined. This fixes problems when passing
  undefined objects to Python semantics expecting APIs.
* Traceback support now works properly for PyPy. (Tested with 1.4)
* Implemented operator intercepting for sandboxed environments. This
  allows application developers to disable builtin operators for
  better security. (For instance limit the mathematical operators to
  actual integers instead of longs)
* Groupby filter now supports dotted notation for grouping by
  attributes of attributes.
* Scoped blocks now properly treat toplevel assignments and imports.
  Previously an import suddenly “disappeared” in a scoped block.
* Automatically detect newer Python interpreter versions before
  loading code from bytecode caches to prevent segfaults on invalid
  opcodes. The segfault in earlier Jinja versions here was not a
  Jinja bug but a limitation in the underlying Python interpreter. If
  you notice Jinja segfaulting in earlier versions after an upgrade
  of the Python interpreter you don’t have to upgrade, it’s enough to
  flush the bytecode cache. This just no longer makes this necessary,
  Jinja will automatically detect these cases now.
* The sum filter can now sum up values by attribute. This is a
  backwards incompatible change. The argument to the filter previously
  was the optional starting index which defaults to zero. This now
  became the second argument to the function because it’s rarely used.
* Like sum, sort now also makes it possible to order items by
  attribute.
* Like sum and sort, join now also is able to join attributes of
  objects as string.
* The internal eval context now has a reference to the environment.
* Added a mapping test to see if an object is a dict or an object with
  a similar interface.

## Version 2.5.5[¶](#version-2-5-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-10-18

* Built documentation is no longer part of release.

## Version 2.5.4[¶](#version-2-5-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-10-17

* Fixed extensions not loading properly with overlays.
* Work around a bug in cpython for the debugger that causes segfaults
  on 64bit big-endian architectures.

## Version 2.5.3[¶](#version-2-5-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-10-17

* Fixed an operator precedence error introduced in 2.5.2. Statements
  like “-foo.bar” had their implicit parentheses applied around the
  first part of the expression (“(-foo).bar”) instead of the more
  correct “-(foo.bar)”.

## Version 2.5.2[¶](#version-2-5-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-08-18

* Improved setup.py script to better work with assumptions people
  might still have from it (`--with-speedups`).
* Fixed a packaging error that excluded the new debug support.

## Version 2.5.1[¶](#version-2-5-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-08-17

* StopIteration exceptions raised by functions called from templates
  are now intercepted and converted to undefineds. This solves a lot
  of debugging grief. (StopIteration is used internally to abort
  template execution)
* Improved performance of macro calls slightly.
* Babel extraction can now properly extract newstyle gettext calls.
* Using the variable `num` in newstyle gettext for something else
  than the pluralize count will no longer raise a [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "(in Python v3.13)").
* Removed builtin markup class and switched to markupsafe. For
  backwards compatibility the pure Python implementation still exists
  but is pulled from markupsafe by the Jinja developers. The debug
  support went into a separate feature called “debugsupport” and is
  disabled by default because it is only relevant for Python 2.4
* Fixed an issue with unary operators having the wrong precedence.

## Version 2.5[¶](#version-2-5 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-05-29, codename Incoherence

* Improved the sort filter (should have worked like this for a long
  time) by adding support for case insensitive searches.
* Fixed a bug for getattribute constant folding.
* Support for newstyle gettext translations which result in a nicer
  in-template user interface and more consistent catalogs.
* It’s now possible to register extensions after an environment was
  created.

## Version 2.4.1[¶](#version-2-4-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-04-20

* Fixed an error reporting bug for undefined.

## Version 2.4[¶](#version-2-4 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-04-13, codename Correlation

* The environment template loading functions now transparently pass
  through a template object if it was passed to it. This makes it
  possible to import or extend from a template object that was passed
  to the template.
* Added a `ModuleLoader` that can load templates from
  precompiled sources. The environment now features a method to
  compile the templates from a configured loader into a zip file or
  folder.
* The \_speedups C extension now supports Python 3.
* Added support for autoescaping toggling sections and support for
  evaluation contexts.
* Extensions have a priority now.

## Version 2.3.1[¶](#version-2-3-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-02-19

* Fixed an error reporting bug on all python versions
* Fixed an error reporting bug on Python 2.4

## Version 2.3[¶](#version-2-3 "Link to this heading")

Released 2010-02-10, codename 3000 Pythons

* Fixes issue with code generator that causes unbound variables to be
  generated if set was used in if-blocks and other small identifier
  problems.
* Include tags are now able to select between multiple templates and
  take the first that exists, if a list of templates is given.
* Fixed a problem with having call blocks in outer scopes that have an
  argument that is also used as local variable in an inner frame
  [#360](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/360).
* Greatly improved error message reporting [#339](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/339)
* Implicit tuple expressions can no longer be totally empty. This
  change makes `{% if %}` a syntax error now. [#364](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/364)
* Added support for translator comments if extracted via babel.
* Added with-statement extension.
* Experimental Python 3 support.

## Version 2.2.1[¶](#version-2-2-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2009-09-14

* Fixes some smaller problems for Jinja on Jython.

## Version 2.2[¶](#version-2-2 "Link to this heading")

Released 2009-09-13, codename Kong

* Include statements can now be marked with `ignore missing` to skip
  non existing templates.
* Priority of `not` raised. It’s now possible to write `not foo in
  bar` as an alias to `foo not in bar` like in python. Previously
  the grammar required parentheses (`not (foo in bar)`) which was
  odd.
* Fixed a bug that caused syntax errors when defining macros or using
  the `{% call %}` tag inside loops.
* Fixed a bug in the parser that made `{{ foo[1, 2] }}` impossible.
* Made it possible to refer to names from outer scopes in included
  templates that were unused in the callers frame [#327](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/327)
* Fixed a bug that caused internal errors if names where used as
  iteration variable and regular variable *after* the loop if that
  variable was unused *before* the loop. [#331](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/331)
* Added support for optional `scoped` modifier to blocks.
* Added support for line-comments.
* Added the `meta` module.
* Renamed (undocumented) attribute “overlay” to “overlayed” on the
  environment because it was clashing with a method of the same name.
* Speedup extension is now disabled by default.

## Version 2.1.1[¶](#version-2-1-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2008-12-25

* Fixed a translation error caused by looping over empty recursive
  loops.

## Version 2.1[¶](#version-2-1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2008-11-23, codename Yasuzō

* Fixed a bug with nested loops and the special loop variable. Before
  the change an inner loop overwrote the loop variable from the outer
  one after iteration.
* Fixed a bug with the i18n extension that caused the explicit
  pluralization block to look up the wrong variable.
* Fixed a limitation in the lexer that made `{{ foo.0.0 }}`
  impossible.
* Index based subscribing of variables with a constant value returns
  an undefined object now instead of raising an index error. This was
  a bug caused by eager optimizing.
* The i18n extension looks up `foo.ugettext` now followed by
  `foo.gettext` if an translations object is installed. This makes
  dealing with custom translations classes easier.
* Fixed a confusing behavior with conditional extending. loops were
  partially executed under some conditions even though they were not
  part of a visible area.
* Added `sort` filter that works like `dictsort` but for arbitrary
  sequences.
* Fixed a bug with empty statements in macros.
* Implemented a bytecode cache system.
* The template context is now weakref-able
* Inclusions and imports “with context” forward all variables now, not
  only the initial context.
* Added a cycle helper called `cycler`.
* Added a joining helper called `joiner`.
* Added a `compile_expression` method to the environment that allows
  compiling of Jinja expressions into callable Python objects.
* Fixed an escaping bug in urlize

## Version 2.0[¶](#version-2-0 "Link to this heading")

Released 2008-07-17, codename Jinjavitus

* The subscribing of objects (looking up attributes and items) changed
  from slightly. It’s now possible to give attributes or items a
  higher priority by either using dot-notation lookup or the bracket
  syntax. This also changed the AST slightly. `Subscript` is gone
  and was replaced with `Getitem` and `Getattr`.
* Added support for preprocessing and token stream filtering for
  extensions. This would allow extensions to allow simplified gettext
  calls in template data and something similar.
* Added `TemplateStream.dump`.
* Added missing support for implicit string literal concatenation.
  `{{ "foo" "bar" }}` is equivalent to `{{ "foobar" }}`
* `else` is optional for conditional expressions. If not given it
  evaluates to `false`.
* Improved error reporting for undefined values by providing a
  position.
* `filesizeformat` filter uses decimal prefixes now by default and
  can be set to binary mode with the second parameter.
* Fixed bug in finalizer

## Version 2.0rc1[¶](#version-2-0rc1 "Link to this heading")

Released 2008-06-09

* First release of Jinja 2.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-10 09:36:01 UTC  ``` Jinja2, a template engine written in pure python, was found to use /tmp as a default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache, which is insecure because the /tmp directory is world-writable and the filenames used by FileSystemBytecodeCache are predictable. A malicious local user could exploit this bug to alter output generated by other user's application using Jinja2 or possibly, execute arbitrary code as another user.

Well, I've build 2.7.2 (which includes a variant of that patch) for Rawhide, which is thus currently affected by the (new) [CVE-2014-0012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0012).  Version 2.7.2 has also been built for F20, but given that it is flawed, I will not create an update. Instead, I'll wait for an updated version of the patch, or a new version.  The final patch can then be ported to the older versions for F19 (2.6), F18 (2.8) and EL5 (2.2.1 and 2.5.5).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c11)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-13 15:43:37 UTC  ``` I'm not too concerned about Rawhide.  That's a development version.  You're clearly aware of it, so I trust you'll ensure it's fixed there as well.  Provided 2.7.2 for F20 hasn't been pushed to stable, I think we can safely say this doesn't affect F20.  Waiting for a proper patch would be ideal, yes, although it probably wouldn't be too hard to just create one ourselves if upstream hasn't done so yet.  The only thing I can't tell by quickly looking is whether this cache directory needs to persist across invocations.  For instance, if it's supposed to survive from one run to the next then mkstemp is probably not the most appropriate way to go unless the location can be written to a config file for subsequent lookups.  I'm not familiar with this code and don't have time to look at it closer right now, but I do see that upstream hasn't yet done anything in this regard yet.  Given the impact of the issue, I think it would be ok to take a "wait and see" approach, provided upstream doesn't take too long.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c12)  Thomas Moschny    2014-01-14 12:43:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c11)) > The only thing I can't tell by quickly looking is whether this cache > directory needs to persist across invocations.

Bugging > upstream.  But that means that the directory name has to predictable in some way, doesn't it? So the real question is, how can you make a temporary file that's both safe and its location is computable across interpreter invocations.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 18:14:15 UTC  ``` There's a few things, and it's tough to do this correctly.  The problem, as I gather it, is you can have more than one user run this which is why they were using directories based on the uid.  What would be ideal here, I think, is to have /var/run/jinja2/ created by the package and that would be the root directory (as opposed to /tmp).  Within this directory can be user-based sub-directorys (/var/run/jinja2/user or /var/run/jinga2/uid) and the code would look to a) see if it exists (if not, create with 0700 perms), and b) see if it is owned by the appropriate user (if not, complain really really loudly).  That's still not perfect, and there might still be a race condition there, but I don't think os.mkdir() will complete successfully if the named path exists as a directory or file, so should be ok).  So perhaps something like:  path = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid() try:     os.mkdir(path, 0700) except Exception as e:     raise e  if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid():     # error and exit  if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700':     # error and exit  That should work I think.  The other alternative is to again use /var/run/jinja2/ but use temp.mkstemp() to create a directory in there, but only if a config file or setting doesn't exist.  For instance, we have something like ~/.jinja2 or ~/.jinja2/config or whatever that has the setting:  path = /var/run/jina2/532/tmp123456  and then the module looks here first as the cache location (probably performing the same tests as above... "is it owned by me?" and "is it mode 0700?" before doing anything with it).  If such a config file/setting doesn't exist, create the file with temp.mkstemp() and write it to the config/setting for subsequent use.  If the noted file doesn't exist (or isn't usable due to failing any tests), create a new one with temp.mkstemp() and save the new path to the config file.  Those seem to to be the two best options to me.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c15)  Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda    2014-01-20 08:12:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)) > There's a few things, and it's tough to do this correctly.

So how is this different from doing the same in /tmp? I don't see why you'd need to move to /var/run/jinja2. Based on what you're saying, I guess the upstream patch is OK, but it needs the two checks you mention:  > if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid(): >     # error and exit >  > if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700': >     # error and exit  Or is there some problem doing this in /tmp that I don't see? Thanks.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c17)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-24 00:09:01 UTC  ``` Persistence.  If the idea is to have the cache persist across invocations of jinja2, then I assume it might be desirable to have it persist across reboots as well.  As many systems clean /tmp on reboot, that would remove the cache as well.  In /var/run/jinja2/ there are no such problems.  I also believe that cache files are not temporary files, necessarily, so I don't know if /tmp is the most appropriate.  Functionally it's the same thing, you're right.  The biggest thing for me is persistence.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-24 20:54:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c17)) > Persistence.

Given that it's only cache meant to provide speed improvement, persistence across reboots may not be that important.  On the other hand, /var/run/jinja2/ would imply new unexpected world-writable directory for administrators to deal with.  There's a workaround to achieve better persistence by setting TMPDIR to point to a directory that isn't wiped on reboot.  I'd leave improving persistence out of scope of this security fix.  The same persistence issues existed before.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-27 15:31:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)) > path = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid() > try: >     os.mkdir(path, 0700) > except Exception as e: >     raise e  This either needs a check for existence before mkdir (as you mentioned), or handle EEXIST error differently.  > if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid(): >     # error and exit >  > if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700': >     # error and exit  os.lstat needs to be used instead of os.stat to avoid symlink + race issues.  Hence something like:  try:     os.mkdir(path, 0700) except OSError as e:     if e.errno != errno.EEXIST:         raise      path_stat = os.lstat(path) if path_stat.st_uid != os.geteuid() \     or not stat.S_ISDIR(path_stat.st_mode) \     or (os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) != 0700:     # raise some "bad permissions" exception  Possibly with all stat checks within except.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-27 15:51:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c9)) > Note that Arun Babu Neelicattu reported [1] that the fix above introduced a > new flaw (temporary file handling) which was assigned the CVE name > [CVE-2014-0012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0012).  The original issue falls into the "insecure temporary file use" category as well.  Both in terms of allowing file overwrite, and making jinja use a cache file from attacker.  Upstream fix changes situation a little - attacker needs to be able to create /tmp/_jinja2-cache-$UID directory before victim, but if they succeed in doing so, they can unlink cache files created by victim at any time.

Thanks!  - Use os.lstat, not os.stat.  os.stat follows symlinks, so attacker can create link that points to some victim's directory with proper permission at the time of the check, and later replace with real directory, or symlink to an attacker's directory.  - Consider checking if path actually is directory.  (See [comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c19) for the both of the above comments.)  - Nitpick: use 0700 instead of 448.  448 is less obvious, are there significant benefits over 0700 to actually use it?  (I know upstream uses 448 elsewhere, so why not fix both while at it? :)  - A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat easier to "DoS" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of cache file permissions.

Ok, will do.  > - Consider checking if path actually is directory.  I don't understand why that'd be needed. If the path is not a directory then there are two possibilities: - It's owned by the user that jinja2 is running under - then Python will just fail when trying to create a file in this directory (which is actually not a directory). - It's owned by another user - the check for owner will rise exception before any attempt to create a cached file.

(I know upstream uses > 448 elsewhere, so why not fix both while at it? :)  Because I want to have a patch acceptable for upstream. If upstream is keen on using 448, then that's what I want to do to keep consistent and to have an acceptable patch (also it's better because of the reason mentioned in [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c24) by Jakub Wilk).  > - A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat > easier to "DoS" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of > cache file permissions.

Yes, the problem is old and I don't think that fixing it is in the scope of this bug.   So to sum up, I think that the only alteration needed for my patch is using "lstat" instead of "stat". Is that correct? Thanks a lot!   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c28)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-28 10:28:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda from [comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c27)) > > - Consider checking if path actually is directory. >  > I don't understand why that'd be needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:0747 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-jinja2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0747)

## Topic

Updated python-jinja2 packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a
Django-inspired, non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an
optional sandboxed environment.

It was discovered that Jinja2 did not properly handle bytecode cache files
stored in the system's temporary directory. A local attacker could use this
flaw to alter the output of an application using Jinja2 and
FileSystemBytecodeCache, and potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of that application. (CVE-2014-1402)

All python-jinja2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to
take effect, all applications using python-jinja2 must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Message-ID: <52CFC3FB.2010007@redhat.com>

From: Ratul Gupta <ratulg@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE Request: python-jinja2: arbitrary code execution vulnerability

Hello,

Jinja2, a template engine written in pure python, was found to use /tmp
as a default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache, which
is insecure because the /tmp directory is world-writable and the
filenames used like 'FileSystemBytecodeCache' are often predictable. A
malicious user could exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code as
another user.

PoC is given on the debian page:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734747>

References:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734747>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1051421>

Can a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-10 09:36:01 UTC  ``` Jinja2, a template engine written in pure python, was found to use /tmp as a default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache, which is insecure because the /tmp directory is world-writable and the filenames used by FileSystemBytecodeCache are predictable. A malicious local user could exploit this bug to alter output generated by other user's application using Jinja2 or possibly, execute arbitrary code as another user.

I've also commented on the upstream commit to make the problem very clear.  So the above patch cannot be used as-is; it needs to be corrected for the temporary file flaw.

Well, I've build 2.7.2 (which includes a variant of that patch) for Rawhide, which is thus currently affected by the (new) [CVE-2014-0012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0012).  Version 2.7.2 has also been built for F20, but given that it is flawed, I will not create an update. Instead, I'll wait for an updated version of the patch, or a new version.  The final patch can then be ported to the older versions for F19 (2.6), F18 (2.8) and EL5 (2.2.1 and 2.5.5).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c11)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-13 15:43:37 UTC  ``` I'm not too concerned about Rawhide.  That's a development version.  You're clearly aware of it, so I trust you'll ensure it's fixed there as well.  Provided 2.7.2 for F20 hasn't been pushed to stable, I think we can safely say this doesn't affect F20.  Waiting for a proper patch would be ideal, yes, although it probably wouldn't be too hard to just create one ourselves if upstream hasn't done so yet.  The only thing I can't tell by quickly looking is whether this cache directory needs to persist across invocations.  For instance, if it's supposed to survive from one run to the next then mkstemp is probably not the most appropriate way to go unless the location can be written to a config file for subsequent lookups.  I'm not familiar with this code and don't have time to look at it closer right now, but I do see that upstream hasn't yet done anything in this regard yet.  Given the impact of the issue, I think it would be ok to take a "wait and see" approach, provided upstream doesn't take too long.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c12)  Thomas Moschny    2014-01-14 12:43:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c11)) > The only thing I can't tell by quickly looking is whether this cache > directory needs to persist across invocations.

Bugging > upstream.  But that means that the directory name has to predictable in some way, doesn't it? So the real question is, how can you make a temporary file that's both safe and its location is computable across interpreter invocations.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-17 18:14:15 UTC  ``` There's a few things, and it's tough to do this correctly.  The problem, as I gather it, is you can have more than one user run this which is why they were using directories based on the uid.  What would be ideal here, I think, is to have /var/run/jinja2/ created by the package and that would be the root directory (as opposed to /tmp).  Within this directory can be user-based sub-directorys (/var/run/jinja2/user or /var/run/jinga2/uid) and the code would look to a) see if it exists (if not, create with 0700 perms), and b) see if it is owned by the appropriate user (if not, complain really really loudly).  That's still not perfect, and there might still be a race condition there, but I don't think os.mkdir() will complete successfully if the named path exists as a directory or file, so should be ok).  So perhaps something like:  path = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid() try:     os.mkdir(path, 0700) except Exception as e:     raise e  if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid():     # error and exit  if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700':     # error and exit  That should work I think.  The other alternative is to again use /var/run/jinja2/ but use temp.mkstemp() to create a directory in there, but only if a config file or setting doesn't exist.  For instance, we have something like ~/.jinja2 or ~/.jinja2/config or whatever that has the setting:  path = /var/run/jina2/532/tmp123456  and then the module looks here first as the cache location (probably performing the same tests as above... "is it owned by me?" and "is it mode 0700?" before doing anything with it).  If such a config file/setting doesn't exist, create the file with temp.mkstemp() and write it to the config/setting for subsequent use.  If the noted file doesn't exist (or isn't usable due to failing any tests), create a new one with temp.mkstemp() and save the new path to the config file.  Those seem to to be the two best options to me.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c15)  Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda    2014-01-20 08:12:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)) > There's a few things, and it's tough to do this correctly.

So how is this different from doing the same in /tmp? I don't see why you'd need to move to /var/run/jinja2. Based on what you're saying, I guess the upstream patch is OK, but it needs the two checks you mention:  > if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid(): >     # error and exit >  > if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700': >     # error and exit  Or is there some problem doing this in /tmp that I don't see? Thanks.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c17)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-24 00:09:01 UTC  ``` Persistence.  If the idea is to have the cache persist across invocations of jinja2, then I assume it might be desirable to have it persist across reboots as well.  As many systems clean /tmp on reboot, that would remove the cache as well.  In /var/run/jinja2/ there are no such problems.  I also believe that cache files are not temporary files, necessarily, so I don't know if /tmp is the most appropriate.  Functionally it's the same thing, you're right.  The biggest thing for me is persistence.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-24 20:54:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c17)) > Persistence.

Given that it's only cache meant to provide speed improvement, persistence across reboots may not be that important.  On the other hand, /var/run/jinja2/ would imply new unexpected world-writable directory for administrators to deal with.  There's a workaround to achieve better persistence by setting TMPDIR to point to a directory that isn't wiped on reboot.  I'd leave improving persistence out of scope of this security fix.  The same persistence issues existed before.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-27 15:31:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c14)) > path = '/var/run/jinja2/%s' % os.getuid() > try: >     os.mkdir(path, 0700) > except Exception as e: >     raise e  This either needs a check for existence before mkdir (as you mentioned), or handle EEXIST error differently.  > if os.stat(path).st_uid is not os.getuid(): >     # error and exit >  > if oct(os.stat(path).st_mode & 0777) is not '0700': >     # error and exit  os.lstat needs to be used instead of os.stat to avoid symlink + race issues.

The original issue falls into the "insecure temporary file use" category as well.  Both in terms of allowing file overwrite, and making jinja use a cache file from attacker.  Upstream fix changes situation a little - attacker needs to be able to create /tmp/_jinja2-cache-$UID directory before victim, but if they succeed in doing so, they can unlink cache files created by victim at any time.

Thanks!  - Use os.lstat, not os.stat.  os.stat follows symlinks, so attacker can create link that points to some victim's directory with proper permission at the time of the check, and later replace with real directory, or symlink to an attacker's directory.  - Consider checking if path actually is directory.  (See [comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c19) for the both of the above comments.)  - Nitpick: use 0700 instead of 448.  448 is less obvious, are there significant benefits over 0700 to actually use it?  (I know upstream uses 448 elsewhere, so why not fix both while at it? :)  - A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat easier to "DoS" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of cache file permissions.  But the problem is not new, older Jinja2 versions could raise exception too if they found cache files they could not use.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c24)  jwilk    2014-01-27 18:56:50 UTC  ``` Jinja2 (>= 2.7) supports Python 2 and Python 3 with single codebase (no 2to3 involved). So upstream can't use 0700, because that's syntax error in Python 3. They could use 0o700 (which is syntactically valid since Python 2.6) or stat.S_IRWXU.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c25)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-27 19:48:39 UTC  ``` Ok, thank you for the clarification!   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c27)  Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda    2014-01-28 09:35:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c23)) > (In reply to Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda from [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c21)) > > Agreed.

Ok, will do.  > - Consider checking if path actually is directory.  I don't understand why that'd be needed. If the path is not a directory then there are two possibilities: - It's owned by the user that jinja2 is running under - then Python will just fail when trying to create a file in this directory (which is actually not a directory). - It's owned by another user - the check for owner will rise exception before any attempt to create a cached file. What do we gain by checking that the path is directory?   > - Nitpick: use 0700 instead of 448.  448 is less obvious, are there > significant benefits over 0700 to actually use it?  (I know upstream uses > 448 elsewhere, so why not fix both while at it? :)  Because I want to have a patch acceptable for upstream. If upstream is keen on using 448, then that's what I want to do to keep consistent and to have an acceptable patch (also it's better because of the reason mentioned in [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c24) by Jakub Wilk).  > - A concern with the $UID directories is that it possibly makes it somewhat > easier to "DoS" other local user by making Jinja2 raise exception because of > cache file permissions.

Yes, the problem is old and I don't think that fixing it is in the scope of this bug.   So to sum up, I think that the only alteration needed for my patch is using "lstat" instead of "stat". Is that correct? Thanks a lot!   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c28)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-28 10:28:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda from [comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c27)) > > - Consider checking if path actually is directory. >  > I don't understand why that'd be needed.

I have no specific significant concern in mind.  The check can lead to better error report.  There should be no negative impact, if re-stat is avoided.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c29)  Bohuslav "Slavek" Kabrda    2014-01-28 10:39:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 856466](attachment.cgi?id=856466&action=diff "Fix for CVE-2014-0012 that uses lstat instead of stat") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=856466&action=edit "Fix for CVE-2014-0012 that uses lstat instead of stat") Fix for [CVE-2014-0012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0012) that uses lstat instead of stat  Ok, so I hope that [attached] is the final and correct patch for the CVE. I just replaced os.stat with os.lstat, no other change since the last patch.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c30)  jwilk    2014-01-28 13:10:46 UTC  ``` The "is it a directory?" check is important, because we don't want to follow symlinks. Just because such a symlink is owned by the correct user, doesn't mean it was created by this user: it could have been hardlinked by an attacker.  Now, on Linux systems we are safe, because symlinks have always 0777 permissions, so they never pass the st_mode check. But it's not neccessarily the case on other systems.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c31)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-29 11:47:19 UTC  ``` Slavek, are you working on submitting pull request upstream?   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c32)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-20 20:34:21 UTC  ``` I did a pull request with a fix that adds ownership, permission and type check for the temporary directory:  <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/pull/296>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1051421#c33)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-02 09:08:19 UTC  ``` There's still no upstream feedback on additional fixes required to fix this issue, and no upstream commits since early Jan.

# RHSA-2014:0748 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python33-python-jinja2 and python27-python-jinja2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0748)

## Topic

Updated python33-python-jinja2 and python27-python-jinja2 packages that fix
one security issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a
Django-inspired, non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an
optional sandboxed environment.

It was discovered that Jinja2 did not properly handle bytecode cache files
stored in the system's temporary directory. A local attacker could use this
flaw to alter the output of an application using Jinja2 and
FileSystemBytecodeCache, and potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of that application. (CVE-2014-1402)

All Jinja2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all applications using Jinja2 must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  protrans    2002-01-06 05:51:35 UTC  ``` I just tried to emerge kdebase and failed, it says something about missing headers. Then I emerge kdelibs-2.2.2-r1 and unmerged kdelibs-2.2.2 and everthing went ok. Is it a problem with kdelibs-2.2.2 or there's dependency problem in kdebase2.2.2.  Thanks,  Joseph H. Yao ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-06 11:56:13 UTC  ``` WORKSFORME, but have mailed submitter and will try to resolve  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 13:26:52 UTC  ``` I've since committed a kde.eclass update that fixes this  ``` |  |
