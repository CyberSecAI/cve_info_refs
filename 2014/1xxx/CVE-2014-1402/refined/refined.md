{
  "CVE-2014-1402": {
    "Description": "The default configuration for bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache in Jinja2 before 2.7.2 does not properly create temporary files, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted .cache file with a name starting with __jinja2_ in /tmp.",
    "Root cause": "The `FileSystemBytecodeCache` in Jinja2 versions prior to 2.7.2 used the `/tmp` directory to store cache files, which is world-writable, and the filenames used are predictable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default directory for cache files",
      "Predictable cache filenames",
       "World-writable directory permissions"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious local user can exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code as another user or alter the output generated by other user's application using Jinja2.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Creation of a malicious cache file in /tmp"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A malicious local user needs to be able to create files in /tmp.",
     "Affected component": "jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache"
  }
