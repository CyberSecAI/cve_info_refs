You can now download Dotclear 2.6.2. This maintenance release includes several fixes for a potential security default on password protected posts and pages, and for some other minor bugs.

Your dashboard should also offer you to upgrade your installation today or tomorrow (depending on your settings). There's also a [patch](http://download.dotclear.org/patches/2.6.1-2.6.2.diff.gz) for the developers who prefer this method.
