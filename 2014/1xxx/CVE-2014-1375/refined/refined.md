Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-1375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A kernel pointer stored in an IOKit object could be retrieved from userland.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Kernel pointer exposure. The vulnerability arises from the fact that a raw kernel address is exposed to user-space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can read a kernel pointer, which can be used to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). KASLR is a security measure to randomize the memory addresses used by the kernel, making exploitation more difficult. Bypassing this protection can enable a more reliable exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges initially, but the vulnerability can aid in privilege escalation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Intel Graphics Driver on OS X Mavericks 10.9 to 10.9.3.
- The fix involves removing the pointer from the IOKit object.
