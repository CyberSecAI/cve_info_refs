  "CVE-2014-1785": {
    "description": "A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 11. There is sufficient time between the free and reuse for an attacker to control the contents of the freed memory and exploit the vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition in the `MSHTML!CSpliceTreeEngine::RemoveSplice` function when handling DOMNodeRemoved events during a document.execCommand(\"Delete\") operation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution if an attacker gains control of the freed memory and exploits the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user visiting a specially crafted webpage in Internet Explorer 11"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and trick the user into visiting it. Basic JavaScript knowledge and ability to craft a malicious HTML page is needed.",
      "affected_versions": [
        "Internet Explorer 11"
      ],
        "additional_information": "This vulnerability is one of the 58 privately reported vulnerabilities resolved in MS14-035, according to the Microsoft Security Bulletin. The vulnerability is triggered when a 0x28 byte memory block allocated during `MSHTML!CMarkup::DoEmbedPointers` through `document.execCommand(\"Delete\")` is freed by `document.open()` within a `DOMNodeRemoved` event handler. After the memory is freed, JavaScript can reallocate the same memory location before it is reused."
