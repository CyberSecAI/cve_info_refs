Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the .NET Framework's improper enforcement of `TypeFilterLevel` checks when handling certain malformed objects. Specifically, the .NET Framework doesn't adequately validate the types of objects in memory during .NET Remoting operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper type validation/enforcement on objects during .NET Remoting.
- Insufficient security controls for application memory related to object types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via .NET Remoting.
- Sending specially crafted data to a vulnerable workstation or server using .NET Remoting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the network/system.
- **Targeted System:** The targeted system must be running an affected version of the .NET Framework and utilizing .NET Remoting.
- **.NET Remoting Endpoint Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with a .NET Remoting endpoint on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the handling of `TypeFilterLevel` checks, which are part of the security mechanism in .NET Remoting.
- .NET Remoting is not widely used, meaning only custom applications specifically designed to use it are vulnerable.
- .NET Remoting endpoints are not typically exposed to anonymous clients by default, providing some defense-in-depth.

The provided content also mentions mitigation, workarounds, and affected software versions:

**Mitigation:**
- The fact that .NET Remoting isn't widely used reduces the overall exposure.
- Default security settings prevent anonymous access to .NET Remoting endpoints.

**Workarounds:**
- Enabling security when registering a channel can limit interaction to authenticated clients only.

**Affected Software:**
Multiple versions of Microsoft .NET Framework are affected across different versions of Windows, including:

- Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1
- Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1

The document also notes that updates are provided via Windows Update, except for some cases where a prior update (2919355) is required on some systems.

The vulnerability was privately reported and there were no reports of exploitation at the time of the security bulletin.
