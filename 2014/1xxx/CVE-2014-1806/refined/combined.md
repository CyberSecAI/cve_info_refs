## Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2958732)

Published: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an authenticated attacker sends specially crafted data to an affected workstation or server that uses .NET Remoting. .NET Remoting is not widely used by applications; only custom applications that have been specifically designed to use .NET Remoting would expose a system to the vulnerability.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 on affected releases of Microsoft Windows.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that .NET Framework properly enforces security controls for application memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

**I am running Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1. Is there a prerequisite for installing the updates for .NET Framework 3.5 or .NET Framework 4.5.1?**

The answer to this question depends on the distribution channel that customers use to obtain security updates. Customers who obtain security updates from Windows Update or the Microsoft Update Catalog must first install the 2919355 update, released in April, 2014, before installing the .NET Framework 3.5 update (2931358) or the .NET Framework 4.5.1 update (2931366) where applicable on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1 systems. For more information about the prerequisite update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355). However, customers who obtain security updates through other channels, such as the Microsoft Download Center or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), there is no such prerequisite; the 2931358 and 2931366 updates may be installed regardless of whether or not the 2919355 update has been installed.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912).

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes changes to add newer security features to older versions of the .NET Framework.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

## TypeFilterLevel Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1806

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework handles TypeFilterLevel checks for some malformed objects.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1806](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-cve-2014-1806).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* .NET Remoting is not widely used by applications; only custom applications that have been specifically designed to use .NET Remoting would expose a system to the vulnerability.
* .NET Remoting endpoints are not accessible to anonymous clients by default.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable security when registering a channel**

  Enabling security when registering a channel will allow only authenticated clients to interact with the vulnerable server. For more information see [Authentication with the TCP Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/59hafwyt).
