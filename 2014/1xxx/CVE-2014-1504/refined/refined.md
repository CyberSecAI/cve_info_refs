Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Content Security Policy (CSP) of `data:` documents was not being preserved during session restore in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey. This means that if a user opened a `data:` URL with specific CSP rules, and the browser crashed, upon restart, the restored page from the `data:` URL would not enforce those CSP rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the Content Security Policy. CSP is designed to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling the resources a browser is allowed to load.
*   **Session Restore Flaw:** The issue lies in the session restore mechanism, which fails to preserve the CSP for `data:` documents. This allows the restored document to operate without the intended security constraints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker can inject a `data:` URL with malicious JavaScript into a webpage with a strict CSP. If the user then interacts with the injected link, the malicious script will execute, bypassing the CSP.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Combined with other bugs that could lead to browser crashes, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Compromised Data:** By executing arbitrary JavaScript, attackers can potentially steal cookies, user data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Injection:** The attacker must inject a `data:` URL onto a webpage. This can be done through various means, including exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
2.  **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to click or interact with the malicious `data:` URL.
3.  **Browser Crash:** The attacker needs to induce a browser crash, for example through other vulnerabilities, before the session restore.
4.  **Session Restore:** The user then restarts the browser, triggering session restore. The restored `data:` URL will load without CSP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject HTML/JS:** The attacker must have the ability to inject content into a page to insert the malicious link to data: URI.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a link.
*   **Ability to Cause Browser Crash:** The attacker needs to be able to cause a browser crash. This can be a vulnerability in the site or any other vulnerability in the browser.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported by Nicolas Golubovic
*   The fix involves ensuring that the CSP is correctly serialized with the principal when saving the browser session, and then correctly deserialized during session restoration.
*   The fix landed in Firefox 28, SeaMonkey 2.25, and other related products.

**In summary,** CVE-2014-1504 highlights a flaw in the way Firefox and SeaMonkey handle CSP for data: documents during session restores. This flaw enables an attacker to bypass CSP and execute malicious code after inducing a browser crash.
