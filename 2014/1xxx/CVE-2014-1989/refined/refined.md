Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an access restriction bypass vulnerability present when using the APIs of Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce access restrictions within the API, which allows users to potentially bypass permissions.
- Specifically, users can delete schedule information even if they do not have the necessary permissions to edit that information. This implies a flaw in the authorization mechanism within the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A logged-in user can delete schedule information they are not authorized to edit. This could result in data loss or disruption of scheduling processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the API interface of the Cybozu Garoon system.
- The attacker must be a logged-in user of the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Cybozu Garoon system. They must have a valid login to the system.
- The attacker needs to interact with the system's API to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cybozu Garoon versions 3.0 to 3.7 Service Pack 3.
- The CVSS base score is 3.5, indicating a low to medium severity vulnerability. The access vector is considered network (N) even though the user has to be authenticated; the complexity is low(L)

This information aligns with the general description of CVE-2014-1989 as it describes an access control vulnerability.
