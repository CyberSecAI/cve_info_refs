Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1584:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2014-1584, specifically in the Mozilla Security Advisory 2014-80, Ubuntu USN-2372-1, and several bugzilla entries. This confirms the relevance of the content to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Firefox handles SSL certificate issuer verification *before* key pinning checks are performed. When a certificate's issuer cannot be verified, the intended key pinning checks are skipped, and the user is presented with an overridable "Untrusted Connection" error page.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Key Pinning Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that the intended key pinning mechanism is circumvented when a certificate's issuer cannot be verified.
   - **Overridable Error:** The user is presented with a standard "Untrusted Connection" error, which they can easily override, effectively bypassing key pinning.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker with control of the DNS connection and a fraudulent certificate could perform a MitM attack by bypassing the intended key pinning protection.
   - **Bypass of security restrictions:** Users can bypass key pinning process by using the "Untrusted Connection" error page, if an issuer verification problem occurs.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network-Based:** The attack requires the attacker to control the DNS or network connection to redirect traffic and present a malicious certificate.
   - **User Interaction:** Although the attack requires user to click through an "Untrusted Connection" error page, the process bypasses pinning checks without the user being aware.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Control:** The attacker needs to be able to control the network or DNS resolution to redirect connections.
   - **Fraudulent Certificate:** The attacker needs to have a fraudulent SSL certificate issued for the targeted domain that would otherwise be valid, except for the pinning.
   - **User Lure:** User interaction is needed in order to bypass the untrusted certificate warning.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists because, under certain conditions, the check for a trusted certificate chain (which includes key pinning checks) doesn't occur before the "Untrusted Connection" error page is shown, allowing an override.

- The fix addresses this issue by ensuring key pinning checks are performed correctly even when issuer verification problems exist.

- The fix for this vulnerability was released in Firefox 33, SeaMonkey 2.30, and corresponding updates to other affected products and distributions.

- The bug report also provides details on the code changes implemented to address the issue.
