Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-1595:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an initialization bug within Apple's `CoreGraphics` framework on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
- Specifically, a variable responsible for controlling input logging was left uninitialized. This uninitialized variable, when combined with the use of a custom memory allocator (like `jemalloc` used by Mozilla products), resulted in input logging being enabled by default.
- The logging was done via `CGSSetDebugOptions(0x80000008)` being effectively enabled due to this uninitialized variable and the poisoning that `jemalloc` performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Variable:** The core issue is the presence of an uninitialized variable within the `CoreGraphics` framework.
- **Default Logging Enabled:** The lack of proper initialization leads to the logging feature being inadvertently turned on.
- **Reliance on Custom Allocator:** The vulnerability's impact is exacerbated by the use of a custom memory allocator, namely `jemalloc`, which writes the `0x5a` byte and causes input logging to be enabled.
- **Information Exposure:** The enabled logging captured input events including keyboard entries, potentially exposing sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** Usernames, passwords, and other inputted data could be captured in log files stored in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Privacy Violation:** User input data, including sensitive information, was written to disk, violating user privacy.
- **Local Access Required:** An attacker would need local access to the affected system to read the log files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access to `/tmp`:** An attacker could gain access to the log files stored in `/tmp` on a vulnerable OS X 10.10 system.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The logging occurs without any required user interaction. Just by running affected applications, such as Firefox, log files are generated automatically.
- **No Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability does not allow for remote exploitation; the attacker must have access to the local file system to read the logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local file system of the machine running a vulnerable application on OS X 10.10.
- **Basic File System Navigation:** The attacker needs the ability to navigate the file system and locate the log files in the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was specific to OS X 10.10 and did not affect earlier versions of the operating system.
- Mozilla addressed this vulnerability in Firefox 34, Firefox ESR 31.3, and Thunderbird 31.3, by explicitly disabling input event logging within their applications.
- Apple fixed the underlying cause with a change that ensured logging was off by default in OS X 10.10.2
- The vulnerability was highly discoverable and impacted many users of the affected software.
- The log files also tended to grow rapidly without bound and could use excessive disk space.
