```
Root cause of vulnerability: The entity module's entity wrapper access API does not sufficiently check entity access on referenced entities.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insufficient access checks on referenced entities.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to data by bypassing access controls on referenced entities, such as taxonomy terms.
Attack vectors: An attacker could exploit a module that uses the access() method of entity metadata wrappers on properties that reference multiple entities to which the user does not have access. For example, using the RESTful Web Services (RESTWS) module with misconfigured permissions on an entity property could allow access to unaccessible referenced user entities on a node entity.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have access to a system using a vulnerable module that makes use of the entity access API. The attacker also needs to have a user role that is not supposed to have access to the referenced entities
