The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS14-036) which addresses two vulnerabilities, CVE-2014-1817 and CVE-2014-1818.

**CVE-2014-1817: Unicode Scripts Processor Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of specially crafted font files by the Unicode Script Processor (usp10.dll).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption due to improper file handling.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with administrative rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Web-based attacks: Visiting a specially crafted website.
    *   Email attachments: Opening a malicious file received as an email attachment.
    *   File sharing: Opening a malicious document file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website, open a malicious attachment, or open a malicious document file.

**CVE-2014-1818: GDI+ Image Parsing Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of specially crafted images by GDI+.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerability in the way GDI+ handles validation of specially crafted images.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer rights are less affected. In some scenarios, kernel mode execution is possible, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Web-based attacks: Visiting a website containing a specially crafted image.
    *   Email attachments: Opening a malicious image file received as an email attachment.
    *   File sharing: Opening a malicious document file containing the malicious image.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious image or document file.
