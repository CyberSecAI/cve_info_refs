Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error located in the Speech Recognition component of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when memory that has been freed is accessed. In this case, a freed object related to speech recognition is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided information doesn't explicitly specify the full impact of exploitation; however, use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to a variety of issues such as:
   - Arbitrary Code Execution: The most severe outcome is the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process. This could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.
   - Denial of Service: Exploiting a use-after-free can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
   - Information Disclosure: In some cases, accessing freed memory can expose sensitive data.
- The Gentoo advisory also states the general impact of multiple Chromium vulnerabilities includes "cross site scripting attacks, bypassing of sandbox protection, potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition."

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, suggesting the vulnerability could be triggered via malicious web content. A user would need to interact with specially crafted content to trigger the use-after-free condition in the Speech Recognition component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to craft a web page or deliver other content that exploits the use-after-free in the Speech Recognition feature of Chromium. This likely requires knowledge of the specific code paths and memory layout within the speech recognition component.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported by Khalil Zhani.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Chromium version 34.0.1847.132.
- Several different distributions (openSUSE, Debian, Gentoo) released patches for this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-1732 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the speech recognition functionality of Chromium. An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by serving crafted malicious content, which could result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
