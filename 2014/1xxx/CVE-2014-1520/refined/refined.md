        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have write access to the temporary directory, which is typically located at `C:\\Windows\\Temp` or `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with write access to the temp directory. Because the directory is created using `GetTickCount()`, the attacker needs to be able to guess the directory name. The exploit is timing-dependent."

For the example with a `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\nsFF1B.tmp\\nsFFCA.tmp.local”` directory, the dlls loaded from the nsFFCA.tmp executable will be first searched in the nsFFCA.tmp.local directory, then in the nscFF1B.tmp directory and at least at the system path."
