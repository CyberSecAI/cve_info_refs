    "Description": "The mozilla::dom::AudioEventTimeline function in the Web Audio API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.1, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.1 does not properly create audio timelines, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted API calls.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper creation of audio timelines in the Web Audio API implementation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Out-of-bounds read, memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Sensitive information disclosure from process memory, denial of service (application crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via crafted API calls to the Web Audio API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to make crafted API calls, likely through a website or other web content that can utilize the Web Audio API."
