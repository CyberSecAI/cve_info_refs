  "CVE-2014-1499": {
    "Description": "Mozilla developer Ehsan Akhgari reported a spoofing attack where the permission prompt for a WebRTC session can appear to be from a different site than its actual originating site if a timed navigation occurs during the prompt generation. This allows an attacker to potentially gain access to the webcam or microphone by masquerading as another site and gaining user permission through spoofing.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition occurs when a timed navigation happens during the WebRTC permission prompt generation. The prompt can then appear to be from the new site, not the originating site.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect association of the permission prompt with the originating website due to asynchronous operations and lack of window ID checks."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially gain access to the webcam or microphone by deceiving the user that the prompt is coming from a legitimate site.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a timed navigation during the WebRTC permission prompt generation. This requires an attacker to induce a specific sequence of events that causes the prompt to be displayed in the context of the new page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control a website and trigger a timed navigation while a WebRTC permission prompt is being generated."
