Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1445:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `wanxl_ioctl()` function in the Linux kernel's `wanxl` driver. This function fails to properly initialize the padding bytes within the `sync_serial_settings` structure, specifically after the `loopback` member.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Information Leak:** The lack of initialization of padding bytes results in the potential disclosure of kernel memory content. The uninitialized padding bytes (2 bytes) could contain sensitive data from the kernel's memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read arbitrary kernel memory locations, specifically 2 bytes from kernel space, leading to information disclosure.
- This leaked information could potentially be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local user or program can trigger the vulnerability by using the `ioctl(2)` system call on a device associated with the `wanxl` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code locally on the system.
- No specific privileges beyond the ability to interact with the driver via `ioctl` are mentioned in the provided documents. However, according to Ubuntu's USN, this vulnerability requires local access, but does not require root privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a `memset(0)` call before filling the `sync_serial_settings` structure within `wanxl_ioctl()`. This will explicitly initialize the padding bytes to zero, preventing the information leak.
- Red Hat indicates that this vulnerability is not present in RHEL 5, 6, and MRG 2, so it only affects specific kernel configurations.
- This vulnerability is present in Linux kernels prior to the fix (commit `2b13d06c9584b4eb773f1e80bbaedab9a1c344e1`).
- This CVE is associated with the fix commit message "wanxl: fix info leak in ioctl".
- Ubuntu's USN-2128-1 and USN-2129-1 identify this as an information leak in the `wanxl ioctl` function.
