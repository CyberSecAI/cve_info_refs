## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used

to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to

discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information

like password length. ([CVE-2013-0160](/security/CVE-2013-0160))

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used

to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to

discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information

like password length. ([CVE-2013-0160](/security/CVE-2013-0160))

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's radiotap header

parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over-

read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](/security/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's SIOCWANDEV ioctl

call. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-1444](/security/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](/security/CVE-2014-1445))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-362-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-362.75](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-362.75)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

commit d969de8d83401683420638c8107dcfedb2146f37 upstream.
Due to missing braces on an if statement, in presence of a device\_node a
port was always assigned -1, regardless of any alias entries in the
device tree. Conversely, if device\_node was NULL, an unitialized port
ended up being used.
This patch adds the missing braces, fixing the issues.

This fixes "lost interrupt" problems that occurred on SPI-based systems.

wireless: radiotap: fix parsing buffer overrun
commit f5563318ff1bde15b10e736e97ffce13be08bc1a upstream.
When parsing an invalid radiotap header, the parser can overrun
the buffer that is passed in because it doesn't correctly check
1) the minimum radiotap header size
2) the space for extended bitmaps
The first issue doesn't affect any in-kernel user as they all
check the minimum size before calling the radiotap function.
The second issue could potentially affect the kernel if an skb
is passed in that consists only of the radiotap header with a
lot of extended bitmaps that extend past the SKB. In that case
a read-only buffer overrun by at most 4 bytes is possible.
Fix this by adding the appropriate checks to the parser.

w1 - call request\_module with w1 master mutex unlocked

request\_module for w1 slave modules needs to be called with the w1
master mutex unlocked. Because w1\_attach\_slave\_device gets always(?)
called with mutex locked, we need to temporarily unlock the w1 master
mutex for the loading of the w1 slave module.

writeback: fix negative bdi max pause
commit e3b6c655b91e01a1dade056cfa358581b47a5351 upstream.
Toralf runs trinity on UML/i386. After some time it hangs and the last
message line is
BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [trinity-child0:1521]
It's found that pages\_dirtied becomes very large. More than 1000000000
pages in this case:
period = HZ \* pages\_dirtied / task\_ratelimit;
BUG\_ON(pages\_dirtied > 2000000000);
BUG\_ON(pages\_dirtied > 1000000000); <---------
UML debug printf shows that we got negative pause here:
ick: pause : -984
ick: pages\_dirtied : 0
ick: task\_ratelimit: 0
pause:
+ if (pause < 0) {
+ extern int printf(char \*, ...);
+ printf("ick : pause : %li\n", pause);
+ printf("ick: pages\_dirtied : %lu\n", pages\_dirtied);
+ printf("ick: task\_ratelimit: %lu\n", task\_ratelimit);
+ BUG\_ON(1);
+ }

Since pause is bounded by [min\_pause, max\_pause] where min\_pause is also
bounded by max\_pause. It's suspected and demonstrated that the
max\_pause calculation goes wrong:
ick: pause : -717
ick: min\_pause : -177
ick: max\_pause : -717
ick: pages\_dirtied : 14
ick: task\_ratelimit: 0
The problem lies in the two "long = unsigned long" assignments in
bdi\_max\_pause() which might go negative if the highest bit is 1, and the
min\_t(long, ...) check failed to protect it falling under 0. Fix all of
them by using "unsigned long" throughout the function.

ALSA: hda - Fix inverted internal mic not indicated on some machines
commit ccb041571b73888785ef7828a276e380125891a4 upstream.
The create\_bind\_cap\_vol\_ctl does not create any control indicating
that an inverted dmic is present. Therefore, create multiple
capture volumes in this scenario, so we always have some indication
that the internal mic is inverted.
This happens on the Lenovo Ideapad U310 as well as the Lenovo Yoga 13
(both are based on the CX20590 codec), but the fix is generic and
could be needed for other codecs/machines too.
Thanks to Szymon Acedański for the pointer and a draft patch.

ALSA: us122l: Fix pcm\_usb\_stream mmapping regression
commit ac536a848a1643e4b87e8fbd376a63091afc2ccc upstream.
The pcm\_usb\_stream plugin requires the mremap explicitly for the read
buffer, as it expands itself once after reading the required size.
But the commit [314e51b9: mm: kill vma flag VM\_RESERVED and
mm->reserved\_vm counter] converted blindly to a combination of
VM\_DONTEXPAND | VM\_DONTDUMP like other normal drivers, and this
resulted in the failure of mremap().
For fixing this regression, we need to remove VM\_DONTEXPAND for the
read-buffer mmap.

Consider the following scenario:
thread 0: reclaim entry x (get refcount, but not call zswap\_get\_swap\_cache\_page)
thread 1: call zswap\_frontswap\_invalidate\_page to invalidate entry x.
finished, entry x and its zbud is not freed as its refcount != 0

zswap\_writeback\_entry do nothing except put refcount
Now, the memory of zswap\_entry x and its zpage leak.
Modify:
- check the refcount in fail path, free memory if it is not referenced.
- use ZSWAP\_SWAPCACHE\_FAIL instead of ZSWAP\_SWAPCACHE\_NOMEM as the fail path
can be not only caused by nomem but also by invalidate.

dm snapshot: fix data corruption
commit e9c6a182649f4259db704ae15a91ac820e63b0ca upstream.
This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been
encountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.
When we allocate a new chunk in persistent\_prepare, we increment
ps->next\_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area
by further incrementing it if necessary.
When we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next\_free is
positioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used
data chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next\_free is positioned
erroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at
the same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata
corruption.
This patch changes the code so that ps->next\_free skips the metadata
area when metadata are loaded in function read\_exceptions.
The patch also moves a piece of code from persistent\_prepare\_exception
to a separate function skip\_metadata to avoid code duplication.

ARM: integrator: deactivate timer0 on the Integrator/CP
commit 29114fd7db2fc82a34da8340d29b8fa413e03dca upstream.
This fixes a long-standing Integrator/CP regression from
commit 870e2928cf3368ca9b06bc925d0027b0a56bcd8e
"ARM: integrator-cp: convert use CLKSRC\_OF for timer init"
When this code was introduced, the both aliases pointing the
system to use timer1 as primary (clocksource) and timer2
as secondary (clockevent) was ignored, and the system would
simply use the first two timers found as clocksource and
clockevent.
However this made the system timeline accelerate by a
factor x25, as it turns out that the way the clocking
actually works (totally undocumented and found after some
trial-and-error) is that timer0 runs @ 25MHz and timer1
and timer2 runs @ 1MHz. Presumably this divider setting
is a boot-on default and configurable albeit the way to
configure it is not documented.
So as a quick fix to the problem, let's mark timer0 as
disabled, so the code will chose timer1 and timer2 as it
used to.
This also deletes the two aliases for the primary and
secondary timer as they have been superceded by the
auto-selection

ARM: 7851/1: check for number of arguments in syscall\_get/set\_arguments()

In ftrace\_syscall\_enter(),
syscall\_get\_arguments(..., 0, n, ...)
if (i == 0) {  ...; n--;}
memcpy(..., n \* sizeof(args[0]));
If 'number of arguments(n)' is zero and 'argument index(i)' is also zero in
syscall\_get\_arguments(), none of arguments should be copied by memcpy().
Otherwise 'n--' can be a big positive number and unexpected amount of data
will be copied. Tracing system calls which take no argument, say sync(void),
may hit this case and eventually make the system corrupted.
This patch fixes the issue both in syscall\_get\_arguments() and
syscall\_set\_arguments().

davinci\_emac.c: Fix IFF\_ALLMULTI setup

When IFF\_ALLMULTI flag is set on interface and IFF\_PROMISC isn't,
emac\_dev\_mcast\_set should only enable RX of multicasts and reset
MACHASH registers.
It does this, but afterwards it either sets up multicast MACs
filtering or disables RX of multicasts and resets MACHASH registers
again, rendering IFF\_ALLMULTI flag useless.
This patch fixes emac\_dev\_mcast\_set, so that multicast MACs filtering and
disabling of RX of multicasts are skipped when IFF\_ALLMULTI flag is set.

ipv6: always prefer rt6i\_gateway if present
[ Upstream commit 96dc809514fb2328605198a0602b67554d8cce7b ]
In v3.9 6fd6ce2056de2709 ("ipv6: Do not depend on rt->n in
ip6\_finish\_output2()." changed the behaviour of ip6\_finish\_output2()
such that the recently introduced rt6\_nexthop() is used
instead of an assigned neighbor.
As rt6\_nexthop() prefers rt6i\_gateway only for gatewayed
routes this causes a problem for users like IPVS, xt\_TEE and
RAW(hdrincl) if they want to use different address for routing
compared to the destination address.
Another case is when redirect can create RTF\_DYNAMIC
route without RTF\_GATEWAY flag, we ignore the rt6i\_gateway
in rt6\_nexthop().
Fix the above problems by considering the rt6i\_gateway if
present, so that traffic routed to address on local subnet is
not wrongly diverted to the destination address.

problematic commit.

inet: fix possible memory corruption with UDP\_CORK and UFO
[ This is a simplified -stable version of a set of upstream commits. ]
This is a replacement patch only for stable which does fix the problems
handled by the following two commits in -net:
"ip\_output: do skb ufo init for peeked non ufo skb as well" (e93b7d748be887cd7639b113ba7d7ef792a7efb9)
"ip6\_output: do skb ufo init for peeked non ufo skb as well" (c547dbf55d5f8cf615ccc0e7265e98db27d3fb8b)
Three frames are written on a corked udp socket for which the output
netdevice has UFO enabled. If the first and third frame are smaller than
the mtu and the second one is bigger, we enqueue the second frame with
skb\_append\_datato\_frags without initializing the gso fields. This leads
to the third frame appended regulary and thus constructing an invalid skb.
This fixes the problem by always using skb\_append\_datato\_frags as soon
as the first frag got enqueued to the skb without marking the packet
as SKB\_GSO\_UDP.
The problem with only two frames for ipv6 was fixed by "ipv6: udp
packets following an UFO enqueued packet need also be handled by UFO"
(2811ebac2521ceac84f2bdae402455baa6a7fb47).

net: unix: inherit SOCK\_PASS{CRED, SEC} flags from socket to fix race
[ Upstream commit 90c6bd34f884cd9cee21f1d152baf6c18bcac949 ]
In the case of credentials passing in unix stream sockets (dgram
sockets seem not affected), we get a rather sparse race after
commit 16e5726 ("af\_unix: dont send SCM\_CREDENTIALS by default").
We have a stream server on receiver side that requests credential
passing from senders (e.g. nc -U). Since we need to set SO\_PASSCRED
on each spawned/accepted socket on server side to 1 first (as it's
not inherited), it can happen that in the time between accept() and
setsockopt() we get interrupted, the sender is being scheduled and
continues with passing data to our receiver. At that time SO\_PASSCRED
is neither set on sender nor receiver side, hence in cmsg's
SCM\_CREDENTIALS we get eventually pid:0, uid:65534, gid:65534
(== overflow{u,g}id) instead of what we actually would like to see.
On the sender side, here nc -U, the tests in maybe\_add\_creds()
invoked through unix\_stream\_sendmsg() would fail, as at that exact
time, as mentioned, the sender has neither SO\_PASSCRED on his side
nor sees it on the server side, and we have a valid 'other' socket
in place. Thus, sender believes it would just look like a normal
connection, not needing/requesting SO\_PASSCRED at that time.
As reverting 16e5726 would not be an option due to the significant
performance regression reported when having creds always passed,
one way/trade-off to prevent that would be to set SO\_PASSCRED on
the listener socket and allow inheriting these flags to the spawned
socket on server side in accept(). It seems also logical to do so
if we'd tell the listener socket to pass those flags onwards, and
would fix the race.

The wanxl\_ioctl() code fails to initialize the two padding bytes of
struct sync\_serial\_settings after the ->loopback member. Add an explicit
memset(0) before filling the structure to avoid the info leak.

sctp: Perform software checksum if packet has to be fragmented.
[ Upstream commit d2dbbba77e95dff4b4f901fee236fef6d9552072 ]
IP/IPv6 fragmentation knows how to compute only TCP/UDP checksum.
This causes problems if SCTP packets has to be fragmented and
ipsummed has been set to PARTIAL due to checksum offload support.
This condition can happen when retransmitting after MTU discover,
or when INIT or other control chunks are larger then MTU.
Check for the rare fragmentation condition in SCTP and use software
checksum calculation in this case.

sctp: Use software crc32 checksum when xfrm transform will happen.
[ Upstream commit 27127a82561a2a3ed955ce207048e1b066a80a2a ]
igb/ixgbe have hardware sctp checksum support, when this feature is enabled
and also IPsec is armed to protect sctp traffic, ugly things happened as
xfrm\_output checks CHECKSUM\_PARTIAL to do checksum operation(sum every thing
up and pack the 16bits result in the checksum field). The result is fail
establishment of sctp communication.

bridge: Correctly clamp MAX forward\_delay when enabling STP
[ Upstream commit 4b6c7879d84ad06a2ac5b964808ed599187a188d ]
Commit be4f154d5ef0ca147ab6bcd38857a774133f5450
bridge: Clamp forward\_delay when enabling STP
had a typo when attempting to clamp maximum forward delay.
It is possible to set bridge\_forward\_delay to be higher then
permitted maximum when STP is off. When turning STP on, the
higher then allowed delay has to be clamed down to max value.

virtio-net: refill only when device is up during setting queues
[ Upstream commit 35ed159bfd96a7547ec277ed8b550c7cbd9841b6 ]
We used to schedule the refill work unconditionally after changing the
number of queues. This may lead an issue if the device is not
up. Since we only try to cancel the work in ndo\_stop(), this may cause
the refill work still work after removing the device. Fix this by only
schedule the work when device is up.
The bug were introduce by commit 9b9cd8024a2882e896c65222aa421d461354e3f2.

virtio-net: don't respond to cpu hotplug notifier if we're not ready
[ Upstream commit 3ab098df35f8b98b6553edc2e40234af512ba877 ]
We're trying to re-configure the affinity unconditionally in cpu hotplug
callback. This may lead the issue during resuming from s3/s4 since
- virt queues haven't been allocated at that time.
- it's unnecessary since thaw method will re-configure the affinity.
Fix this issue by checking the config\_enable and do nothing is we're not ready.
The bug were introduced by commit 8de4b2f3ae90c8fc0f17eeaab87d5a951b66ee17

bnx2x: record rx queue for LRO packets
[ Upstream commit 60e66fee56b2256dcb1dc2ea1b2ddcb6e273857d ]
RPS support is kind of broken on bnx2x, because only non LRO packets
get proper rx queue information. This triggers reorders, as it seems
bnx2x like to generate a non LRO packet for segment including TCP PUSH
flag : (this might be pure coincidence, but all the reorders I've
seen involve segments with a PUSH)

We must call skb\_record\_rx\_queue() to properly give to RPS (and more
generally for TX queue selection on forward path) the receive queue
information.
Similar fix is needed for skb\_mark\_napi\_id(), but will be handled
in a separate patch to ease stable backports.

François Cachereul made a very nice bug report and suspected

This problem was added by commit 6af88da14ee284aaad6e4326da09a89191ab6165
("l2tp: Fix locking in l2tp\_core.c").
l2tp\_eth\_dev\_xmit() runs from BH context, so we must disable BH
from other l2tp\_xmit\_skb() users.

commit 52f7719832d949815e989b18587bfcc67f6af64a

vti: get rid of nf mark rule in prerouting
[ Upstream commit 7263a5187f9e9de45fcb51349cf0e031142c19a1 ]
This patch fixes and improves the use of vti interfaces (while
lightly changing the way of configuring them).
Currently:
- it is necessary to identify and mark inbound IPsec
packets destined to each vti interface, via netfilter rules in
the mangle table at prerouting hook.
- the vti module cannot retrieve the right tunnel in input since
commit b9959fd3: vti tunnels all have an i\_key, but the tunnel lookup
is done with flag TUNNEL\_NO\_KEY, so there no chance to retrieve them.
- the i\_key is used by the outbound processing as a mark to lookup
for the right SP and SA bundle.
This patch uses the o\_key to store the vti mark (instead of i\_key) and
enables:
- to avoid the need for previously marking the inbound skbuffs via a
netfilter rule.
- to properly retrieve the right tunnel in input, only based on the IPsec
packet outer addresses.
- to properly perform an inbound policy check (using the tunnel o\_key
as a mark).
- to properly perform an outbound SPD and SAD lookup (using the tunnel
o\_key as a mark).
- to keep the current mark of the skbuff. The skbuff mark is neither
used nor changed by the vti interface. Only the vti interface o\_key
is used.
SAs have a wildcard mark.
SPs have a mark equal to the vti interface o\_key.
The vti interface must be created as follows (i\_key = 0, o\_key = mark):
ip link add vti1 mode vti local 1.1.1.1 remote 2.2.2.2 okey 1
The SPs attached to vti1 must be created as follows (mark = vti1 o\_key):
ip xfrm policy add dir out mark 1 tmpl src 1.1.1.1 dst 2.2.2.2 \
proto esp mode tunnel
ip xfrm policy add dir in mark 1 tmpl src 2.2.2.2 dst 1.1.1.1 \
proto esp mode tunnel
The SAs are created with the default wildcard mark. There is no
distinction between global vs. vti SAs. Just their addresses will
possibly link them to a vti interface:
ip xfrm state add src 1.1.1.1 dst 2.2.2.2 proto esp spi 1000 mode tunnel \
enc "cbc(aes)" "azertyuiopqsdfgh"
ip xfrm state add src 2.2.2.2 dst 1.1.1.1 proto esp spi 2000 mode tunnel \
enc "cbc(aes)" "sqbdhgqsdjqjsdfh"
To avoid matching "global" (not vti) SPs in vti interfaces, global SPs
should no use the default wildcard mark, but explicitly match mark 0.
To avoid a double SPD lookup in input and output (in global and vti SPDs),
the NOPOLICY and NOXFRM options should be set on the vti interfaces:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vti1/disable\_policy
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/vti1/disable\_xfrm
The outgoing traffic is steered to vti1 by a route via the vti interface:
ip route add 192.168.0.0/16 dev vti1
The incoming IPsec traffic is steered to vti1 because its outer addresses
match the vti1 tunnel configuration.

Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"
[ Upstream commit 454594f3b93a49ef568cd190c5af31376b105a7b ]
While this commit was a good attempt to fix issues occuring when no
multicast querier is present, this commit still has two more issues:
1) There are cases where mdb entries do not expire even if there is a
querier present. The bridge will unnecessarily continue flooding
multicast packets on the according ports.
2) Never removing an mdb entry could be exploited for a Denial of
Service by an attacker on the local link, slowly, but steadily eating up
all memory.
Actually, this commit became obsolete with
"bridge: disable snooping if there is no querier" (b00589af3b)
which included fixes for a few more cases.
Therefore reverting the following commits (the commit stated in the
commit message plus three of its follow up fixes):
====================
Revert "bridge: update mdb expiration timer upon reports."
This reverts commit f144febd93d5ee534fdf23505ab091b2b9088edc.
Revert "bridge: do not call setup\_timer() multiple times"
This reverts commit 1faabf2aab1fdaa1ace4e8c829d1b9cf7bfec2f1.
Revert "bridge: fix some kernel warning in multicast timer"
This reverts commit c7e8e8a8f7a70b343ca1e0f90a31e35ab2d16de1.
Revert "bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received"
This reverts commit 9f00b2e7cf241fa389733d41b615efdaa2cb0f5b.

bridge: update mdb expiration timer upon reports.
[ Upstream commit f144febd93d5ee534fdf23505ab091b2b9088edc ]
commit 9f00b2e7cf241fa389733d41b615efdaa2cb0f5b
bridge: only expire the mdb entry when query is received
changed the mdb expiration timer to be armed only when QUERY is
received. Howerver, this causes issues in an environment where
the multicast server socket comes and goes very fast while a client
is trying to send traffic to it.
The root cause is a race where a sequence of LEAVE followed by REPORT
messages can race against QUERY messages generated in response to LEAVE.
The QUERY ends up starting the expiration timer, and that timer can
potentially expire after the new REPORT message has been received signaling
the new join operation. This leads to a significant drop in multicast
traffic and possible complete stall.
The solution is to have REPORT messages update the expiration timer
on entries that already exist.

dma\_unmap\_page never reached because condition to detect last fragment
in page is wrong. offset+frag\_stride can't be greater than size, need to
make sure no additional frag will fit in page => compare offset +
frag\_stride + next\_frag\_size instead.
next\_frag\_size is the same as the current one, since page is shared only

xen-netback: Don't destroy the netdev until the vif is shut down
[ upstream commit id: 279f438e36c0a70b23b86d2090aeec50155034a9 ]
Without this patch, if a frontend cycles through states Closing
and Closed (which Windows frontends need to do) then the netdev
will be destroyed and requires re-invocation of hotplug scripts
to restore state before the frontend can move to Connected. Thus
when udev is not in use the backend gets stuck in InitWait.
With this patch, the netdev is left alone whilst the backend is
still online and is only de-registered and freed just prior to
destroying the vif (which is also nicely symmetrical with the
netdev allocation and registration being done during probe) so
no re-invocation of hotplug scripts is required.

sit: amend "allow to use rtnl ops on fb tunnel"
Amend backport to 3.11.y of
[ Upstream commit 205983c43700ac3a81e7625273a3fa83cd2759b5 ]
The discussion thread in the upstream commit mentions that in
backports to stable-\* branches, the line
- unregister\_netdevice\_queue(sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev, &list);
must be omitted if that branch does not have commit 5e6700b3bf98
("sit: add support of x-netns"). This line has correctly been omitted
in the backport to 3.10, which indeed does not have that commit.
It was also removed in the backport to 3.11.y, which does have that
commit.
This causes the following steps to hit a BUG at net/core/dev.c:5039:
`modprobe sit; rmmod sit`
The bug demonstrates that it causes a device to be unregistered twice.
The simple fix is to apply the one line in the upstream commit that
was dropped in the backport to 3.11 (3783100374653e2e7fbdf68c710f5).
This brings the logic in line with upstream linux, net and net-next
branches.

batman-adv: set up network coding packet handlers during module init
[ Upstream commit 6c519bad7b19a2c14a075b400edabaa630330123 ]
batman-adv saves its table of packet handlers as a global state, so handlers
must be set up only once (and setting them up a second time will fail).
The recently-added network coding support tries to set up its handler each time
a new softif is registered, which obviously fails when more that one softif is
used (and in consequence, the softif creation fails).
Fix this by splitting up batadv\_nc\_init into batadv\_nc\_init (which is called
only once) and batadv\_nc\_mesh\_init (which is called for each softif); in
addition batadv\_nc\_free is renamed to batadv\_nc\_mesh\_free to keep naming
consistent.

tcp: fix incorrect ca\_state in tail loss probe
[ Upstream commit 031afe4990a7c9dbff41a3a742c44d3e740ea0a1 ]
On receiving an ACK that covers the loss probe sequence, TLP
immediately sets the congestion state to Open, even though some packets
are not recovered and retransmisssion are on the way. The later ACks
may trigger a WARN\_ON check in step D of tcp\_fastretrans\_alert(), e.g.,
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=989251
The fix is to follow the similar procedure in recovery by calling
tcp\_try\_keep\_open(). The sender switches to Open state if no packets
are retransmissted. Otherwise it goes to Disorder and let subsequent
ACKs move the state to Recovery or Open.

tcp: do not forget FIN in tcp\_shifted\_skb()
[ Upstream commit 5e8a402f831dbe7ee831340a91439e46f0d38acd ]
Yuchung found following problem :
There are bugs in the SACK processing code, merging part in
tcp\_shift\_skb\_data(), that incorrectly resets or ignores the sacked
skbs FIN flag. When a receiver first SACK the FIN sequence, and later
throw away ofo queue (e.g., sack-reneging), the sender will stop
retransmitting the FIN flag, and hangs forever.
Following packetdrill test can be used to reproduce the bug.
$ cat sack-merge-bug.pkt
`sysctl -q net.ipv4.tcp\_fack=0`
// Establish a connection and send 10 MSS.
0.000 socket(..., SOCK\_STREAM, IPPROTO\_TCP) = 3

First, a typo inverted left/right of one OR operation, then
code forgot to advance end\_seq if the merged skb carried FIN.

tcp: must unclone packets before mangling them
[ Upstream commit c52e2421f7368fd36cbe330d2cf41b10452e39a9 ]
TCP stack should make sure it owns skbs before mangling them.
We had various crashes using bnx2x, and it turned out gso\_size
was cleared right before bnx2x driver was populating TC descriptor
of the \_previous\_ packet send. TCP stack can sometime retransmit
packets that are still in Qdisc.
Of course we could make bnx2x driver more robust (using
ACCESS\_ONCE(shinfo->gso\_size) for example), but the bug is TCP stack.
We have identified two points where skb\_unclone() was needed.
This patch adds a WARN\_ON\_ONCE() to warn us if we missed another
fix of this kind.
Kudos to Neal for finding the root cause of this bug. Its visible
using small MSS.

tcp: TSQ can use a dynamic limit
[ Upstream commit c9eeec26e32e087359160406f96e0949b3cc6f10 ]
When TCP Small Queues was added, we used a sysctl to limit amount of
packets queues on Qdisc/device queues for a given TCP flow.
Problem is this limit is either too big for low rates, or too small
for high rates.
Now TCP stack has rate estimation in sk->sk\_pacing\_rate, and TSO
auto sizing, it can better control number of packets in Qdisc/device
queues.
New limit is two packets or at least 1 to 2 ms worth of packets.
Low rates flows benefit from this patch by having even smaller
number of packets in queues, allowing for faster recovery,
better RTT estimations.
High rates flows benefit from this patch by allowing more than 2 packets
in flight as we had reports this was a limiting factor to reach line
rate. [ In particular if TX completion is delayed because of coalescing
parameters ]
Example for a single flow on 10Gbp link controlled by FQ/pacing
14 packets in flight instead of 2
$ tc -s -d qd
qdisc fq 8001: dev eth0 root refcnt 32 limit 10000p flow\_limit 100p
buckets 1024 quantum 3028 initial\_quantum 15140
Sent 1168459366606 bytes 771822841 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0
requeues 6822476)
rate 9346Mbit 771713pps backlog 953820b 14p requeues 6822476
2047 flow, 2046 inactive, 1 throttled, delay 15673 ns
2372 gc, 0 highprio, 0 retrans, 9739249 throttled, 0 flows\_plimit
Note that sk\_pacing\_rate is currently set to twice the actual rate, but
this might be refined in the future when a flow is in congestion
avoidance.
Additional change : skb->destructor should be set to tcp\_wfree().
A future patch (for linux 3.13+) might remove tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes

tcp: TSO packets automatic sizing
[ Upstream commits 6d36824e730f247b602c90e8715a792003e3c5a7,
02cf4ebd82ff0ac7254b88e466820a290ed8289a, and parts of
7eec4174ff29cd42f2acfae8112f51c228545d40 ]
After hearing many people over past years complaining against TSO being
bursty or even buggy, we are proud to present automatic sizing of TSO
packets.
One part of the problem is that tcp\_tso\_should\_defer() uses an heuristic
relying on upcoming ACKS instead of a timer, but more generally, having
big TSO packets makes little sense for low rates, as it tends to create
micro bursts on the network, and general consensus is to reduce the
buffering amount.
This patch introduces a per socket sk\_pacing\_rate, that approximates
the current sending rate, and allows us to size the TSO packets so
that we try to send one packet every ms.
This field could be set by other transports.
Patch has no impact for high speed flows, where having large TSO packets
makes sense to reach line rate.
For other flows, this helps better packet scheduling and ACK clocking.
This patch increases performance of TCP flows in lossy environments.
A new sysctl (tcp\_min\_tso\_segs) is added, to specify the
minimal size of a TSO packet (default being 2).
A follow-up patch will provide a new packet scheduler (FQ), using
sk\_pacing\_rate as an input to perform optional per flow pacing.
This explains why we chose to set sk\_pacing\_rate to twice the current
rate, allowing 'slow start' ramp up.
sk\_pacing\_rate = 2 \* cwnd \* mss / srtt
v2: Neal Cardwell reported a suspect deferring of last two segments on
initial write of 10 MSS, I had to change tcp\_tso\_should\_defer() to take
into account tp->xmit\_size\_goal\_segs
