Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's improper validation of permissions under specific conditions. This can allow scripts to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The core issue is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should have within the Internet Explorer process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their privileges within the context of Internet Explorer.
- **Combined with RCE:**  This vulnerability, by itself, doesn't allow arbitrary code execution. However, when combined with a separate remote code execution vulnerability, it allows the attacker to execute their arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. For example, a separate RCE might run code with low integrity. The EoP vulnerability could then be used to re-run the code at medium integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website or inject malicious content into compromised websites.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website, typically through phishing or social engineering tactics such as:
    - Tricking a user into clicking on a link in an email or instant message
    - Tricking a user into opening an attachment in an email
 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attacker needs the ability to host or control a website that contains the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs the ability to persuade a victim into visiting the website.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, explaining how this vulnerability would be used in conjunction with an RCE to achieve full code execution at a higher integrity level.
- The vulnerability is listed as "Important" in severity, and could impact both client and server versions of Windows.

- It is also noted that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time the security bulletin was issued.
