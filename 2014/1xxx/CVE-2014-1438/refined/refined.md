{
  "CVE-2014-1438": {
    "Root cause": "Missing handling of FPU exceptions during task switch at the `emms` instruction on AMD K7/K8 platforms.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inappropriate handling of Floating Point Unit(FPU) exceptions during task switch at 'emms' instruction",
      "Missing sanitation of CPU state during task switch"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (task kill, system crash) or privilege escalation. A user/program could use this flaw to kill tasks at random, leading to DoS. Potentially, if allowed to map NULL page (`mmap_min_addr=0`), root privileges could be gained.",
     "Attack vectors": [
          "Local user execution of specially crafted application",
           "Through the vm86 syscall",
           "Triggering FPU exceptions just before process exit"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unprivileged local user on affected AMD K7/K8 systems."
  }
