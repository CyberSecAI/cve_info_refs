systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Mathy Vanhoef discovered an error in the the way the ath9k driver was

handling the BSSID masking. A remote attacker could exploit this error to

discover the original MAC address after a spoofing atack. ([CVE-2013-4579](/security/CVE-2013-4579))

Andrew Honig reported an error in the Linux Kernel's Kernel Virtual Machine

(KVM) VAPIC synchronization operation. A local user could exploit this flaw

to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2013-6368](/security/CVE-2013-6368))

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol

implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-7339](/security/CVE-2013-7339))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the

Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD

based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain

privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](/security/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1444-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1444.63](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1444.63)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

(KVM) VAPIC synchronization operation. A local user could exploit this flaw

to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2013-6368](/security/CVE-2013-6368))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the

Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD

based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain

privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](/security/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-239-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-239.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-239.55)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-47.71~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Introduction

## Problem description:

The initial observation was, that
the linux vm86 syscall, which allows to use the virtual-8086 mode
from userspace for emulating of old 8086 software as done with dosemu,
was prone to trigger FPU errors. Closer analysis showed, that in
general, the handling of the FPU control register and unhandled
FPU-exception could trigger CPU-exceptions at unexpected locations,
also in ring-0 code. Key player is the *emms* instruction, which
will fault when e.g. cr0 has bits set due to unhandled errors.
This only affects kernels on some processor architectures, currently
only AMD K7/K8 seems to be relevant.

# Methods

<Virtual86SwitchToEmmsFault.c>
was the first POC, that triggers kernel-panic via vm86 syscall.
Depending on task layout and kernel scheduler timing, the program
might just cause an OOPS without heavy side-effects on the system.
OOPS might happen up to 1min after invocation, depending on the
scheduler operation and which of the other tasks are using the FPU.
Sometimes it causes recursive page faults, thus locking up the
entire machine.

To allow reproducible tests on at least a local machine, the
random code execution test tool
(<Virtual86RandomCode.c>)
might be useful. It still uses the vm86-syscall, but executes
random code, thus causing the FPU and task schedule to trigger
a multitude of faults and to faster lock-up the system.
When executed via network, executed random data
can be recorded and replayed even when target machine locks up
completely. Network test:

socat TCP4-LISTEN:1234,reuseaddr=1,fork=1 EXEC:./Virtual86RandomCode,nofork=1
tee TestInput < /dev/urandom | socat - TCP4:x.x.x.x:1234 > ProcessedBlocks

An improved version allows to bring the FPU into the same state
without using the vm86-syscall. The key instruction is *fldcw*
(floating point unit load control word). When enabling exceptions
in one process just before exit, the task switch of two other
processes later on might fail. It seems that due to that failure,
the *task->nsproxy* ends up being NULL, thus causing
NULL-pointer dereference in *exit\_shm* during *do\_exit*.

When the NULL-page is mapped, the NULL-dereference could be used
to fake a rw-semaphore data structure. In *exit\_shm*, the
kernel attemts to *down\_write* the semaphore, which adds
the value 0xffff0001 at a user-controllable location. Since the
NULL-dereference does not allow arbitrary reads, the task memory
layout is unknown, thus standard change of EUID of running task
is not possible. Apart from that, we are in *do\_exit*, so
we would have to change another task. A suitable target is the
*shmem\_xattr\_handlers* list, which is at an address known
from System.map. Usually it contains two valid handlers and a
NULL value to terminate the list. As we are lucky, the value
after NULL is 1, thus adding 0xffff0001 to the position of the
NULL-value plus 2 will will turn the NULL into 0x10000 (the
first address above mmap\_min\_addr) and the following 1 value
into NULL, thus terminating the handler list correctly again.

The code to perform those steps can be found in
<FpuStateTaskSwitchShmemXattrHandlersOverwriteWithNullPage.c>

The modification of the *shmem\_xattr\_handlers* list is
completely silent (could be a nice data-only backdoor) until someone
performs a *getxattr* call on a mounted tempfs. Since such
a file-system is mounted by default at */run/shm*, another
program can turn this into arbitrary ring-0 code execution. To
avoid searching the process list to give EUID=0, an alternative
approach was tested. When invoking the xattr-handlers, a single
integer value write to another static address known from System.map
(*modprobe\_path*) will change the default modprobe userspace
helper pathname from */sbin/modprobe* to */tmp//modprobe*.
When unknown executable formats or network protocols are requested,
the program /tmp//modprobe is executed as root, this demo just
adds a script to turn */bin/dd* into a SUID-binary. dd could
then be used to modify libc to plant another backdoor there. The
code to perform those steps can be found in
<ManipulatedXattrHandlerForPrivEscalation.c>.

# Results, Discussion

A closer analysis of the initial vm86-syscall problem showed,
that root cause was missing handling of FPU exceptions during task
switch at *emms* instruction. That was confirmed by
[Borislav Petkov](https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/1/9/590).
According to discussion on LKML, the problem should affect only
AMD CPUs, both in i386 and amd64-mode, see also
[patch](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=26bef1318adc1b3a530ecc807ef99346db2aa8b0).

Exploitation of the bug allowed to kill tasks at random on
all affected kernels under test, thus leading to a denial of
service when killing e.g. init or the idle task. At least on
i386 architectures without SMP (Debian Sid i486 kernel), the
bug also triggers a NULL-pointer dereference, which was proven
useful to gain root privileges when NULL-page was mapped, see
[POC](FpuStateTaskSwitchShmemXattrHandlersOverwriteWithNullPage.c).

Since only some architectures are affected and local exploitation
usually only results in DOS (*mmap\_min\_addr* set to zero
should be rare on most systems, so escalation should be very
uncommon) this vulnerability should not have a high impact on
total system security.

sched: Guarantee new group-entities always have weight
commit 0ac9b1c21874d2490331233b3242085f8151e166 upstream.
Currently, group entity load-weights are initialized to zero. This
admits some races with respect to the first time they are re-weighted in
earlty use. ( Let g[x] denote the se for "g" on cpu "x". )
Suppose that we have root->a and that a enters a throttled state,
immediately followed by a[0]->t1 (the only task running on cpu[0])
blocking:
put\_prev\_task(group\_cfs\_rq(a[0]), t1)
put\_prev\_entity(..., t1)
check\_cfs\_rq\_runtime(group\_cfs\_rq(a[0]))
throttle\_cfs\_rq(group\_cfs\_rq(a[0]))
Then, before unthrottling occurs, let a[0]->b[0]->t2 wake for the first
time:
enqueue\_task\_fair(rq[0], t2)
enqueue\_entity(group\_cfs\_rq(b[0]), t2)
enqueue\_entity\_load\_avg(group\_cfs\_rq(b[0]), t2)
account\_entity\_enqueue(group\_cfs\_ra(b[0]), t2)
update\_cfs\_shares(group\_cfs\_rq(b[0]))
< skipped because b is part of a throttled hierarchy >
enqueue\_entity(group\_cfs\_rq(a[0]), b[0])
...
We now have b[0] enqueued, yet group\_cfs\_rq(a[0])->load.weight == 0
which violates invariants in several code-paths. Eliminate the
possibility of this by initializing group entity weight.

sched: Fix hrtimer\_cancel()/rq->lock deadlock
commit 927b54fccbf04207ec92f669dce6806848cbec7d upstream.
\_\_start\_cfs\_bandwidth calls hrtimer\_cancel while holding rq->lock,
waiting for the hrtimer to finish. However, if sched\_cfs\_period\_timer
runs for another loop iteration, the hrtimer can attempt to take
rq->lock, resulting in deadlock.
Fix this by ensuring that cfs\_b->timer\_active is cleared only if the
\_latest\_ call to do\_sched\_cfs\_period\_timer is returning as idle. Then
\_\_start\_cfs\_bandwidth can just call hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel and wait for
that to succeed or timer\_active == 1.

sched: Fix race on toggling cfs\_bandwidth\_used
commit 1ee14e6c8cddeeb8a490d7b54cd9016e4bb900b4 upstream.
When we transition cfs\_bandwidth\_used to false, any currently
throttled groups will incorrectly return false from cfs\_rq\_throttled.
While tg\_set\_cfs\_bandwidth will unthrottle them eventually, currently
running code (including at least dequeue\_task\_fair and
distribute\_cfs\_runtime) will cause errors.
Fix this by turning off cfs\_bandwidth\_used only after unthrottling all
cfs\_rqs.
Tested: toggle bandwidth back and forth on a loaded cgroup. Caused
crashes in minutes without the patch, hasn't crashed with it.

netfilter: nf\_nat: fix access to uninitialized buffer in IRC NAT helper
commit 2690d97ade05c5325cbf7c72b94b90d265659886 upstream.
Commit 5901b6be885e attempted to introduce IPv6 support into
IRC NAT helper. By doing so, the following code seemed to be removed
by accident:
ip = ntohl(exp->master->tuplehash[IP\_CT\_DIR\_REPLY].tuple.dst.u3.ip);
sprintf(buffer, "%u %u", ip, port);
pr\_debug("nf\_nat\_irc: inserting '%s' == %pI4, port %u\n", buffer, &ip, port);
This leads to the fact that buffer[] was left uninitialized and
contained some stack value. When we call nf\_nat\_mangle\_tcp\_packet(),
we call strlen(buffer) on excatly this uninitialized buffer. If we
are unlucky and the skb has enough tailroom, we overwrite resp. leak
contents with values that sit on our stack into the packet and send
that out to the receiver.
Since the rather informal DCC spec [1] does not seem to specify
IPv6 support right now, we log such occurences so that admins can
act accordingly, and drop the packet. I've looked into XChat source,
and IPv6 is not supported there: addresses are in u32 and print
via %u format string.
Therefore, restore old behaviour as in IPv4, use snprintf(). The
IRC helper does not support IPv6 by now. By this, we can safely use
strlen(buffer) in nf\_nat\_mangle\_tcp\_packet() and prevent a buffer
overflow. Also simplify some code as we now have ct variable anyway.

netfilter: fix wrong byte order in nf\_ct\_seqadj\_set internal information
commit 23dfe136e2bf8d9ea1095704c535368a9bc721da upstream.
In commit 41d73ec053d2, sequence number adjustments were moved to a
separate file. Unfortunately, the sequence numbers that are stored
in the nf\_ct\_seqadj structure are expressed in host byte order. The
necessary ntohl call was removed when the call to adjust\_tcp\_sequence
was collapsed into nf\_ct\_seqadj\_set. This broke the FTP NAT helper.
Fix it by adding back the byte order conversions.

mfd: rtsx\_pcr: Disable interrupts before cancelling delayed works
commit 73beb63d290f961c299526852884846b0d868840 upstream.
This fixes a kernel panic when resuming from suspend to RAM.
Without this fix an interrupt hits after the delayed work is canceled
and thus requeues it. So we end up freeing an armed timer.

commit e70988d1aaf73221355e06125c9937bd4b27761c upstream.
It can be a problem when a pattern is loaded via the firmware interface.
LP55xx common driver has already locked the mutex in 'lp55xx\_firmware\_loaded()'.
So it should be deleted.
On the other hand, locks are required in store\_engine\_load()
on updating program memory.

Commit 6d9252bd9a4bb (clk: Add support for power of two type dividers)
merged in v3.6 added the \_get\_val function to convert a divisor value to
a register field value depending on the flags. However it used the type
u8 for the div field, causing divisors larger than 255 to be masked
and the resultant clock rate to be too high.
E.g. in my case an 11bit divider was supposed to divide 24.576 MHz down
to 32.768KHz. The divisor was correctly calculated as 750 (0x2ee). This
was masked to 238 (0xee) resulting in a frequency of 103.26KHz.

parisc: Ensure full cache coherency for kmap/kunmap
commit f8dae00684d678afa13041ef170cecfd1297ed40 upstream.
Helge Deller noted a few weeks ago problems with the AIO support on
parisc. This change is the result of numerous iterations on how best to
deal with this problem.
The solution adopted here is to provide full cache coherency in a
uniform manner on all parisc systems. This involves calling
flush\_dcache\_page() on kmap operations and flush\_kernel\_dcache\_page() on
kunmap operations. As a result, the copy\_user\_page() and
clear\_user\_page() functions can be removed and the overall code is
simpler.
The change ensures that both userspace and kernel aliases to a mapped
page are invalidated and flushed. This is necessary for the correct
operation of PA8800 and PA8900 based systems which do not support
inequivalent aliases.
With this change, I have observed no cache related issues on c8000 and
rp3440. It is now possible for example to do kernel builds with "-j64"
on four way systems.
On systems using XFS file systems, the patch recently posted by Mikulas
Patocka to "fix crash using XFS on loopback" is needed to avoid a hang
caused by an uninitialized lock passed to flush\_dcache\_page() in the
page struct.

bridge: use spin\_lock\_bh() in br\_multicast\_set\_hash\_max
[ Upstream commit fe0d692bbc645786bce1a98439e548ae619269f5 ]
br\_multicast\_set\_hash\_max() is called from process context in
net/bridge/br\_sysfs\_br.c by the sysfs store\_hash\_max() function.
br\_multicast\_set\_hash\_max() calls spin\_lock(&br->multicast\_lock),
which can deadlock the CPU if a softirq that also tries to take the
same lock interrupts br\_multicast\_set\_hash\_max() while the lock is
held . This can happen quite easily when any of the bridge multicast
timers expire, which try to take the same lock.
The fix here is to use spin\_lock\_bh(), preventing other softirqs from
executing on this CPU.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a bridge with several interfaces (I used 4).
2. Set the "multicast query interval" to a low number, like 2.
3. Enable the bridge as a multicast querier.
4. Repeatedly set the bridge hash\_max parameter via sysfs.
# brctl addbr br0
# brctl addif br0 eth1 eth2 eth3 eth4
# brctl setmcqi br0 2
# brctl setmcquerier br0 1

ipv4: fix tunneled VM traffic over hw VXLAN/GRE GSO NIC
[ Upstream commit 7a7ffbabf99445704be01bff5d7e360da908cf8e ]
VM to VM GSO traffic is broken if it goes through VXLAN or GRE
tunnel and the physical NIC on the host supports hardware VXLAN/GRE
GSO offload (e.g. bnx2x and next-gen mlx4).
Two issues -
(VXLAN) VM traffic has SKB\_GSO\_DODGY and SKB\_GSO\_UDP\_TUNNEL with
SKB\_GSO\_TCP/UDP set depending on the inner protocol. GSO header
integrity check fails in udp4\_ufo\_fragment if inner protocol is
TCP. Also gso\_segs is calculated incorrectly using skb->len that
includes tunnel header. Fix: robust check should only be applied
to the inner packet.
(VXLAN & GRE) Once GSO header integrity check passes, NULL segs
is returned and the original skb is sent to hardware. However the
tunnel header is already pulled. Fix: tunnel header needs to be
restored so that hardware can perform GSO properly on the original
packet.

vlan: Fix header ops passthru when doing TX VLAN offload.
[ Upstream commit 2205369a314e12fcec4781cc73ac9c08fc2b47de ]
When the vlan code detects that the real device can do TX VLAN offloads
in hardware, it tries to arrange for the real device's header\_ops to
be invoked directly.
But it does so illegally, by simply hooking the real device's
header\_ops up to the VLAN device.
This doesn't work because we will end up invoking a set of header\_ops
routines which expect a device type which matches the real device, but
will see a VLAN device instead.
Fix this by providing a pass-thru set of header\_ops which will arrange
to pass the proper real device instead.
To facilitate this add a dev\_rebuild\_header(). There are
implementations which provide a ->cache and ->create but not a
->rebuild (f.e. PLIP). So we need a helper function just like
dev\_hard\_header() to avoid crashes.
Use this helper in the one existing place where the
header\_ops->rebuild was being invoked, the neighbour code.
With lots of help from Florian Westphal.

net: rose: restore old recvmsg behavior
[ Upstream commit f81152e35001e91997ec74a7b4e040e6ab0acccf ]
recvmsg handler in net/rose/af\_rose.c performs size-check ->msg\_namelen.
After commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c
(net: rework recvmsg handler msg\_name and msg\_namelen logic), we now
always take the else branch due to namelen being initialized to 0.
Digging in netdev-vger-cvs git repo shows that msg\_namelen was
initialized with a fixed-size since at least 1995, so the else branch
was never taken.
Compile tested only.

ipv6: always set the new created dst's from in ip6\_rt\_copy
[ Upstream commit 24f5b855e17df7e355eacd6c4a12cc4d6a6c9ff0 ]
ip6\_rt\_copy only sets dst.from if ort has flag RTF\_ADDRCONF and RTF\_DEFAULT.
but the prefix routes which did get installed by hand locally can have an
expiration, and no any flag combination which can ensure a potential from
does never expire, so we should always set the new created dst's from.
This also fixes the new created dst is always expired since the ort, which
is created by RA, maybe has RTF\_EXPIRES and RTF\_ADDRCONF, but no RTF\_DEFAULT.

net: inet\_diag: zero out uninitialized idiag\_{src,dst} fields
[ Upstream commit b1aac815c0891fe4a55a6b0b715910142227700f ]
Jakub reported while working with nlmon netlink sniffer that parts of
the inet\_diag\_sockid are not initialized when r->idiag\_family != AF\_INET6.
That is, fields of r->id.idiag\_src[1 ... 3], r->id.idiag\_dst[1 ... 3].
In fact, it seems that we can leak 6 \* sizeof(u32) byte of kernel [slab]
memory through this. At least, in udp\_dump\_one(), we allocate a skb in ...
rep = nlmsg\_new(sizeof(struct inet\_diag\_msg) + ..., GFP\_KERNEL);
... and then pass that to inet\_sk\_diag\_fill() that puts the whole struct
inet\_diag\_msg into the skb, where we only fill out r->id.idiag\_src[0],
r->id.idiag\_dst[0] and leave the rest untouched:
r->id.idiag\_src[0] = inet->inet\_rcv\_saddr;
r->id.idiag\_dst[0] = inet->inet\_daddr;
struct inet\_diag\_msg embeds struct inet\_diag\_sockid that is correctly /
fully filled out in IPv6 case, but for IPv4 not.
So just zero them out by using plain memset (for this little amount of
bytes it's probably not worth the extra check for idiag\_family == AF\_INET).
Similarly, fix also other places where we fill that out.

This is because we hold the rtnl\_lock() before ndo\_change\_mtu() and try to flush
the work in netvsc\_change\_mtu(), in the mean time, netdev\_notify\_peers() may be
called from worker and also trying to hold the rtnl\_lock. This will lead the
flush won't succeed forever. Solve this by not canceling and flushing the work,
this is safe because the transmission done by NETDEV\_NOTIFY\_PEERS was
synchronized with the netif\_tx\_disable() called by netvsc\_change\_mtu().

tg3: Initialize REG\_BASE\_ADDR at PCI config offset 120 to 0
[ Upstream commit 388d3335575f4c056dcf7138a30f1454e2145cd8 ]
The new tg3 driver leaves REG\_BASE\_ADDR (PCI config offset 120)
uninitialized. From power on reset this register may have garbage in it. The
Register Base Address register defines the device local address of a
register. The data pointed to by this location is read or written using
the Register Data register (PCI config offset 128). When REG\_BASE\_ADDR has
garbage any read or write of Register Data Register (PCI 128) will cause the
PCI bus to lock up. The TCO watchdog will fire and bring down the system.

This changes ensures that the routing entry investigated by the suppress

fixing a possible kernel oops situation when verifying the interface group
associated with a routing table entry.
According to Daniel Golle, this Oops can be triggered by a user process trying
to establish an outgoing IPv6 connection while having no real IPv6 connectivity
set up (only autoassigned link-local addresses).

packet: fix send path when running with proto == 0
[ Upstream commit 66e56cd46b93ef407c60adcac62cf33b06119d50 ]
Commit e40526cb20b5 introduced a cached dev pointer, that gets
hooked into register\_prot\_hook(), \_\_unregister\_prot\_hook() to
update the device used for the send path.
We need to fix this up, as otherwise this will not work with
sockets created with protocol = 0, plus with sll\_protocol = 0
passed via sockaddr\_ll when doing the bind.
So instead, assign the pointer directly. The compiler can inline
these helper functions automagically.
While at it, also assume the cached dev fast-path as likely(),
and document this variant of socket creation as it seems it is
not widely used (seems not even the author of TX\_RING was aware
of that in his reference example [1]). Tested with reproducer
from e40526cb20b5.

br: fix use of ->rx\_handler\_data in code executed on non-rx\_handler path
[ Upstream commit 859828c0ea476b42f3a93d69d117aaba90994b6f ]
br\_stp\_rcv() is reached by non-rx\_handler path. That means there is no
guarantee that dev is bridge port and therefore simple NULL check of
->rx\_handler\_data is not enough. There is need to check if dev is really
bridge port and since only rcu read lock is held here, do it by checking
->rx\_handler pointer.
Note that synchronize\_net() in netdev\_rx\_handler\_unregister() ensures
this approach as valid.

We must clear local\_df when passing the skb between namespaces as the

rds: prevent BUG\_ON triggered on congestion update to loopback
[ Upstream commit 18fc25c94eadc52a42c025125af24657a93638c0 ]
After congestion update on a local connection, when rds\_ib\_xmit returns
less bytes than that are there in the message, rds\_send\_xmit calls
back rds\_ib\_xmit with an offset that causes BUG\_ON(off & RDS\_FRAG\_SIZE)
to trigger.
For a 4Kb PAGE\_SIZE rds\_ib\_xmit returns min(8240,4096)=4096 when actually
the message contains 8240 bytes. rds\_send\_xmit thinks there is more to send
and calls rds\_ib\_xmit again with a data offset "off" of 4096-48(rds header)
=4048 bytes thus hitting the BUG\_ON(off & RDS\_FRAG\_SIZE) [RDS\_FRAG\_SIZE=4k].
The commit 6094628bfd94323fc1cea05ec2c6affd98c18f7f
"rds: prevent BUG\_ON triggering on congestion map updates" introduced
this regression. That change was addressing the triggering of a different
BUG\_ON in rds\_send\_xmit() on PowerPC architecture with 64Kbytes PAGE\_SIZE:
BUG\_ON(ret != 0 &&
conn->c\_xmit\_sg == rm->data.op\_nents);
This was the sequence it was going through:
(rds\_ib\_xmit)
/\* Do not send cong updates to IB loopback \*/
if (conn->c\_loopback
&& rm->m\_inc.i\_hdr.h\_flags & RDS\_FLAG\_CONG\_BITMAP) {
rds\_cong\_map\_updated(conn->c\_fcong, ~(u64) 0);
return sizeof(struct rds\_header) + RDS\_CONG\_MAP\_BYTES;
}
rds\_ib\_xmit returns 8240
rds\_send\_xmit:
c\_xmit\_data\_off = 0 + 8240 - 48 (rds header accounted only the first time)
= 8192
c\_xmit\_data\_off < 65536 (sg->length), so calls rds\_ib\_xmit again
rds\_ib\_xmit returns 8240
rds\_send\_xmit:
c\_xmit\_data\_off = 8192 + 8240 = 16432, calls rds\_ib\_xmit again
and so on (c\_xmit\_data\_off 24672,32912,41152,49392,57632)
rds\_ib\_xmit returns 8240
On this iteration this sequence causes the BUG\_ON in rds\_send\_xmit:
while (ret) {
tmp = min\_t(int, ret, sg->length - conn->c\_xmit\_data\_off);
[tmp = 65536 - 57632 = 7904]
conn->c\_xmit\_data\_off += tmp;
[c\_xmit\_data\_off = 57632 + 7904 = 65536]
ret -= tmp;
[ret = 8240 - 7904 = 336]
if (conn->c\_xmit\_data\_off == sg->length) {
conn->c\_xmit\_data\_off = 0;
sg++;
conn->c\_xmit\_sg++;
BUG\_ON(ret != 0 &&
conn->c\_xmit\_sg == rm->data.op\_nents);
[c\_xmit\_sg = 1, rm->data.op\_nents = 1]
What the current fix does:
Since the congestion update over loopback is not actually transmitted
as a message, all that rds\_ib\_xmit needs to do is let the caller think
the full message has been transmitted and not return partial bytes.
It will return 8240 (RDS\_CONG\_MAP\_BYTES+48) when PAGE\_SIZE is 4Kb.
And 64Kb+48 when page size is 64Kb.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-37.53~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-37.53~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Before we do an EMMS in the AMD FXSAVE information leak workaround we
need to clear any pending exceptions, otherwise we trap with a
floating-point exception inside this code.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Mathy Vanhoef discovered an error in the the way the ath9k driver was

handling the BSSID masking. A remote attacker could exploit this error to

discover the original MAC address after a spoofing atack. ([CVE-2013-4579](/security/CVE-2013-4579))

Andrew Honig reported an error in the Linux Kernel's Kernel Virtual Machine

(KVM) VAPIC synchronization operation. A local user could exploit this flaw

to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2013-6368](/security/CVE-2013-6368))

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol

implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-7339](/security/CVE-2013-7339))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the

Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD

based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain

privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](/security/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM

driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](/security/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-60-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-60.91)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-239-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.5.0-239.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-239.55)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

Saran Neti reported a flaw in the ipv6 UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFI) in

the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2013-4563](/security/CVE-2013-4563))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
