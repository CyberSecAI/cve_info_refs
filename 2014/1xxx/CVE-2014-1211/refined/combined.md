##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware ESXi and ESX NFC NULL pointer dereference

VMware ESXi and ESX contain a NULL pointer dereference in the handling of the Network File Copy (NFC) traffic. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and modify the NFC traffic between ESXi/ESX and the client. Exploitation of the issue may lead to a Denial of Service.

To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components should be deployed on an isolated management network.

VMware would like to thank Alex Chapman of Context Information Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2014-1207 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

##### b. VMware VMX process denial of service vulnerability

Due to a flaw in the handling of invalid ports, it is possible to cause the VMX process to fail. This vulnerability may allow a guest user to affect the VMX process resulting in a partial denial of service on the host.

VMware would like to thank Recurity Labs GmbH and the Bundesamt Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) for reporting this issue to us

##### c. VMware vCloud Director Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

VMware vCloud Director contains a vulnerability in the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http) session management. An attacker may trick an authenticated user to click a malicious link, which would result in the user being logged out. The user is able to immediately log back into the system.

VMware would like to thank Mattia Folador for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2014-1211 to this issue.
