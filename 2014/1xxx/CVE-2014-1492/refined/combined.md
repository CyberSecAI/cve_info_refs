User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86\_64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130803192641
Steps to reproduce:
The implementation of cert\_TestHostName() at <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3d20597e0a07/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c#l1384> does not handle IDNA domain prefixes according to RFC 6125, section 6.4.3 "Checking of Wildcard Certificates". <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.3>
Actual results:
A CN or subjectAltName DNS wildcard such as 'x\*.example.org' should not match a IDNA A-label like 'xn--www-una.example.org'.
Expected results:
cert\_TestHostName() should not use wildcard matching if the first fragment of a hostname is an IDNA A-label. Chromium has such a special case in <http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/cert/x509_certificate.cc?revision=212341#l640>

Confirming, this is indeed what the RFC says. Thankfully people generally don't get prefix wildcards like x\*, they go ahead and get the full \* if they're going to pay for it. In practice this may not affect that many real certs or domains.
In current NSS code x\*, xn\*, xn-\*, and xn--\* will match all IDNA labels.
Spec-compliant behavior would mean that you could \_never\_ have a wildcard cert match an IDNA label unless it was simply "\*". Seems a bit unfair to folks with non-roman alphabets but ACE-encoding doesn't really make for workable prefixes and suffixes I guess.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csec-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csec-other&resolution=---),

Thanks for your confirmation, Daniel.
I agree with you. It is unlikely that many sites will be affected by the issue. In fact I haven't seen any partial wildcards like 'x\*' in the wild, yet. The attached patch should take care of the issue. Do you have some sort of unit tests for hostname matching in NSS, too?

What's the status on this issue? Firefox 24 has been released without a fix.

The status is that it is "new," which means it is unfixed as of yet. It is currently not assigned to a developer. Given that it was reported when Firefox 24 was well under development, it was always unlikely to be fixed there. We still need to decide how we want to address this.

Thank you very much. I'm not familiar with your release schedule and release policy, hence my question.

We have a six week cycle and a "train" model of shipping. Bugs are fixed on trunk. Once every six weeks, trunk is ported to the Aurora branch. After another six weeks, the Aurora branch becomes the Beta branch. After another six weeks, the Beta branch is released as the release branch. See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process>
For serious security issues, we'll fix it on trunk (when the bug will be resolved as "fixed") and then port it to the other branches. This is a sec-moderate issue so it is unlikely to be ported once it is a fixed without a special need.

Christian, thank you for the patch, however, the patch needs a modification.
>+ /\* RFC 6125 IDN matching \*/
>+ int firstace = PORT\_Strcasecmp('xn--', cn);
The result of this call will never be zero, because the common name will never be equal to 'xn--'.
If you want to limit the comparison to the first 4 characters, it should be
int firstace = PORT\_Strncasecmp('xn--', cn, 4);
Besides that, your approach looks correct to me.
Because the other comparisons already use '!', it might be more consistent to write
&& !firstace

Yes, your patch looks fine.

Thanks a lot Kai and Al!
The fix has been pushed to hg by Kai. That is as public as it can get. :)

Well, no, since no one who uses NSS is using the version with this fix yet.

Attached patch

[v3: Use C string literal "xn--" instead of Python string literal 'xn--'](attachment.cgi?id=8381010&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8381010&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=903885&attachment=8381010)

Patch v2 has two bugs.
1. It uses the Python string literal 'xn--'.
2. It still allows the pattern "x\*.python.org" to match the hostname
"xn--tda.python.org".
This patch fixes the first problem by using the C string literal "xn--".

To match the Chromium code that Christian cited in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=903885#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hostname matching code violates RFC 6125 for IDNA"), I think
we can replace the last line with this:
&& (PORT\_Strncasecmp(hn, "xn--", 4) || wildcard == cn)) {
The firstcndot - wildcard == 1 test above ensures that '\*' is followed
by the first dot in |cn|, so the wildcard == cn test implies that
there is nothing before '\*' in |cn|.
If you think this makes sense, I'll add this change to my patch. Note
that this will allow the pattern "\*.python.org" to match the hostname
"xn--tda.python.org".

You're right, because the comparison is currently made against the common name, but the comparison must be done against the actual hostname...

I need to translate it into human language to be certain about it.
This means:
- if the hostname doesn't start with "xn--" (not equal) the comparison returns != 0,
meaning the comparison results in a "true" value,
this sub-expression will be true (second part ignored),
and the overall "if statement expression" will allowed to become true, meaning
a valid match.
- if the hostname starts with "xn--" (equal) the comparison returns 0,
meaning the comparison results in a "false" value,
meaning the hostname is IDNA,
and the second part (after "||") will decide about the result of the expression.
If the wildcard is found at the beginning of the common name (cn),
then we allow the overall if-statement-expression to become true meaning a valid match.
However, if the wildcard position differs from the beginning of the common name,
there are characters in front of the wildcard, and we don't allow that,
the expression will be false, and will cause the overall if-statement-expression
to be false, and rejected as not matching.
I agree your patch makes sense.
Please feel free to add my explanation as a comment to the patch.
I might also be helpful to add some additional comments:
- && firstcndot - wildcard == 1
- && secondcndot - firstcndot > 1
- && PORT\_Strrchr(cn, '\*') == wildcard
+ && firstcndot - wildcard == 1 /\* no chars between \* and . \*/
+ && secondcndot - firstcndot > 1 /\* not .. \*/
+ && PORT\_Strrchr(cn, '\*') == wildcard /\* only one wildcard in cn \*/
> Note

Yes, and I understand Dan already agreed this makes sense, when he said in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=903885#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hostname matching code violates RFC 6125 for IDNA"):
> Spec-compliant behavior would mean that you could \_never\_ have a wildcard cert match

A shorter version of my longer explanation, suitable for a code comment:
/\* If hn starts with xn--, then cn must start with wildcard \*/
Since our builds are currently broken, I'm going to check your changes in.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=903885&attachment=8381492)

This is Wan-Teh's patch v3, an incremental patch on top of v2.
It contains the additional change that Wan-Teh proposed in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=903885#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hostname matching code violates RFC 6125 for IDNA").
My changes on top of those are limited to comments.

Nit: it may be clearer to say "wildcard is the last char in the first component". You can omit "the" to shorten this comment.

This comment should say "the second component is non-empty".
By the way, this test and the secondcndot[1] test (which
ensures the third component is non-empty) don't seem necessary
to me.

Sorry, I don't have time to think about this. If it's important, let's file a follow-up bug, or I'd appreciate if someone else can ponder and confirm.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-03-24 07:01:08 UTC  ``` In a wildcard certificate, the wildcard character should not be embedded within the U-label of an internationalized domain name. This was not properly implemented in NSS, as a result it did not handle IDNA domain prefixes according to RFC 6125, section 6.4.3 "Checking of Wildcard Certificates". <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.3>  Upstream patch: <https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/15ea62260c21> <https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/2ffa40a3ff55> <https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/709d4e597979>  Upstream bug (not public): <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903885>  This issue was fixed upstream in NSS 3.16: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/NSS_3.16_release_notes>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-24 21:05:47 UTC  ``` The problem here is that NSS did not previously follow recommendation (SHOULD NOT rather than MUST NOT) related to handling of certificates with names including wildcards against IDNA hostnames.  The problem can occur under following conditions: - user instructs an application with support for internationalized domain names (IDN) to visit a URL containing non-ASCII characters - server for the domain presents a wildcard certificate with a wildcard label that contains characters followed by *  For example: - user enters URL: <https://bücher.example.de> - URL with unicode character is ASCII encoded as: <https://xn--bcher-kva.example.de> - server presents a certificate for name x*.example.de - NSS versions before 3.16 accept certificate as valid for the specified host even though RFC 6125 section 6.4.3 recommends it SHOULD NOT be accepted  Few other factors that limit impact of this issue: - use of wildcard certificates that contains label with both normal characters and wildcard character is uncommon, many applications do not support those at all - anyone able to get a certificate for x*.example.de from a trusted CA is also likely to be able to obtain certificate for *.example.de from the same CA.  Per RFC 6125, applications may accept such certificate when asked to connect to bücher.example.de  This fix is more of a security hardening than a vulnerability fix, especially considering that the cited RFC discourages, but does not forbid previous behavior.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-24 21:09:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-04-29 18:51:20 UTC  ``` MFSA for fixes applied to Firefox 29 and Seamonkey 2.26:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-45.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-07-22 18:00:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0917 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0917.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1079851#c10)  Martin Prpič    2014-07-28 11:37:12 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125 recommendations.

Package        : nss
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1741 CVE-2013-5606 CVE-2014-1491 CVE-2014-1492

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network
Security Service library:

CVE-2013-1741

    Runaway memset in certificate parsing on 64-bit computers leading to
    a crash by attempting to write 4Gb of nulls.

CVE-2013-5606

    Certificate validation with the verifylog mode did not return
    validation errors, but instead expected applications to determine
    the status by looking at the log.

CVE-2014-1491

    Ticket handling protection mechanisms bypass due to the lack of
    restriction of public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges.

CVE-2014-1492

    Incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates could
    allow specially-crafted invalid certificates to be considered as
    valid.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2:3.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

\* bmo#903885 - (CVE-2014-1492) In a wildcard certificate,
the wildcard character should not be embedded within
the U-label of an internationalized domain name. See
the last bullet point in RFC 6125, Section 7.2.
\* Supports the Linux x32 ABI. To build for the Linux x32
target, set the environment variable USE\_X32=1 when
building NSS. New Functions:
\* NSS\_CMSSignerInfo\_Verify New Macros
\* TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA,
TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, etc., cipher suites that
were first defined in SSL 3.0 can now be referred to
with their official IANA names in TLS, with the TLS\_
prefix. Previously, they had to be referred to with
their names in SSL 3.0, with the SSL\_ prefix. Notable
Changes:
\* ECC is enabled by default. It is no longer necessary to
set the environment variable NSS\_ENABLE\_ECC=1 when
building NSS. To disable ECC, set the environment
variable NSS\_DISABLE\_ECC=1 when building NSS.
\* libpkix should not include the common name of CA as DNS
names when evaluating name constraints.
\* AESKeyWrap\_Decrypt should not return SECSuccess for
invalid keys.
\* Fix a memory corruption in sec\_pkcs12\_new\_asafe.
\* If the NSS\_SDB\_USE\_CACHE environment variable is set,
skip the runtime test sdb\_measureAccess.
\* The built-in roots module has been updated to version
1.97, which adds, removes, and distrusts several
certificates.
\* The atob utility has been improved to automatically
ignore lines of text that aren't in base64 format.
\* The certutil utility has been improved to support
creation of version 1 and version 2 certificates, in
addition to the existing version 3 support.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are generally cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 113 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Please note that on April 18, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160 OpenSSL "Heartbleed"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-0160.html). This Critical Patch Update includes an update to MySQL Enterprise Server 5.6 and this update includes a fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-0160. Customers of other Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the [fixes](/security-alerts/opensslheartbleedcve-2014-0160.html)  that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-0160.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 20 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4170&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# Network Security Services (NSS)[](#network-security-services-nss "Link to this heading")

Warning

This NSS documentation was just imported from our legacy MDN repository. It
currently is very deprecated and likely incorrect or broken in many places.

**Network Security Services** (**NSS**) is a set of libraries designed to
support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSL v3, TLS, PKCS #5,
PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other
security standards.

NSS is available under the Mozilla Public License v2 (MPLv2).

# USN-2159-1: NSS vulnerability

2 April 2014

NSS could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) - Network Security Service library

## Details

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled wildcard certificates when

used with internationalized domain names. If a remote attacker were able to

perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to spoof

SSL servers.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [2:3.15.4-0ubuntu0.13.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/2%3A3.15.4-0ubuntu0.13.10.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -

# USN-2185-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

29 April 2014

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij,

Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, John Schoenick, Karl Tomlinson, Vladimir

Vukicevic and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in

Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1518](/security/CVE-2014-1518), [CVE-2014-1519](/security/CVE-2014-1519))

An out of bounds read was discovered in Web Audio. An attacker could

potentially exploit this cause a denial of service via application crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1522](/security/CVE-2014-1522))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1523](/security/CVE-2014-1523))

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL

object as an XBL object. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1524](/security/CVE-2014-1524))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Text Track Manager when

processing HTML video. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1525](/security/CVE-2014-1525))

Jukka Jylänki discovered an out-of-bounds write in Cairo when working

with canvas in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1528](/security/CVE-2014-1528))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can

run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. An attacker

could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1529](/security/CVE-2014-1529))

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load

a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting or phishing

attacks. ([CVE-2014-1530](/security/CVE-2014-1530))

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some

circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1531](/security/CVE-2014-1531))

Christian Heimes discovered that NSS did not handle IDNA domain prefixes

correctly for wildcard certificates. An attacker could potentially exploit

this by using a specially crafted certificate to conduct a machine-in-the-middle

attack. ([CVE-2014-1492](/security/CVE-2014-1492))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during

host resolution in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1532](/security/CVE-2014-1532))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the debugger bypassed XrayWrappers for some

objects. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website

whilst using the debugger, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1526](/security/CVE-2014-1526))

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 33 new security fixes for Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2016 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include  [Oracle Database](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015.html#AppendixDB) and  [Oracle Fusion Middleware](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015.html#AppendixFMW) components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This new release breaks my firefox. Add ons do not all work and it alsohas removed addon bar and bunched everything onto the menue bar. I expect addon should stay compatable and addon bar should only be removed by my choice.

             CVE-2013-4238
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vSphere product updates address a Cross Site Scripting issue,
   a certificate validation issue and security vulnerabilities in
   third-party libraries.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server Appliance 5.1 Prior to Update 3

   VMware vCenter Server 5.5 prior to Update 2
   VMware vCenter Server 5.1 prior to Update 3
   VMware vCenter Server 5.0 prior to Update 3c

   VMware ESXi 5.1 without patch ESXi510-201412101-SG

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      vCSA           5.0        any       Not Affected

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM
      service.

      VMware would like to thank The Google Security Team for reporting
      this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-45

## Incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates

Announced
April 29, 2014
Reporter
Christian Heimes
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 29
* SeaMonkey 2.26

### Description

Security researcher  **Christian Heimes** reported that the [Network Security
Services (NSS) library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Overview_of_NSS) does not handle IDNA domain prefixes according to [RFC 6125](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6125.txt) for wildcard
certificates. This leads to improper wildcard matching of domains when they
should not be matched in compliance with the specification. This issue was fixed
in NSS version 3.16.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle has received specific reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply these Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

Oracle acknowledges Dana Taylor of netinfiltration.com for bringing to Oracle's attention a number of sites that were vulnerable to disclosure of sensitive information because Oracle CPU fixes were not applied to those sites for more than a year.

This Critical Patch Update contains 154 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on September 26, 2014, Oracle released a [Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169 "Bash"](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2014-7169.html) and other publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting GNU Bash. Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in the Security Alert for CVE-2014-7169.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1912224.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1912224.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Oracle Fusion Middleware](#AppendixFMW) sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2014 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (October 2014), [My Oracle Support Note 1923805.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1923805.1).

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 22 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
