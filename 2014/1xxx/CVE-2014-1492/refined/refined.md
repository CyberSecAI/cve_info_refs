## Analysis of CVE-2014-1492

Here's an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2014-1492:

### Summary:

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications) hostname matching logic within the Network Security Services (NSS) library, specifically concerning wildcard certificates. This flaw could allow specially crafted, invalid certificates with international characters to be accepted as valid.

### Root cause of vulnerability:

The root cause is that the NSS library's `cert_TestHostName()` function did not properly implement the checks specified in RFC 6125 section 6.4.3, which governs how wildcard certificates should behave when matched against IDNA domain names, particularly A-labels (ASCII-compatible encoding of internationalized domain names). Specifically, the code incorrectly handled wildcard characters embedded within the U-label (Unicode representation) of an internationalized domain name, allowing invalid matches.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:

*   **Incorrect Wildcard Matching:** The primary weakness was that wildcard matching was performed even when the first fragment of the hostname was an IDNA A-label, which should have been excluded for partial wildcard matches like `x*.example.org` and `xn--www-una.example.org` or `x*.example.org` and `xn--tda.example.org` as mentioned in the bug report. This allowed certificate validation to pass when it should have failed as it violates the RFC.
*   **Improper handling of IDNA prefixes:** The code failed to recognize and exclude "xn--" prefixes from wildcard matching, leading to incorrect certificate validation.
*   **Lack of strict enforcement of RFC 6125**: NSS did not strictly adhere to the recommendations for IDNA hostname matching against wildcard certificates, treating `SHOULD NOT` as `MAY`.
    *   _Note that the RFC states `A client SHOULD NOT consider a match legitimate if the wildcard character is not the first character of the presented identifier.`_

### Impact of exploitation:

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by presenting a specially crafted certificate with a wildcard that incorrectly matches the target domain.
*   **Spoofing SSL Servers:** Attackers could potentially spoof legitimate SSL servers by using a certificate that incorrectly validates because of this flaw. This can lead to sensitive information being transmitted to the attacker.
*   **Acceptance of Invalid Certificates:** Invalid certificates with internationalized characters could be accepted as valid.

### Attack vectors:

*   **Network-based attacks:** By intercepting and modifying network traffic between a client and a server.
*   **MitM attack scenario:** An attacker intercepts the traffic, presenting a maliciously crafted certificate containing a wildcard to impersonate a server that has an internationalized domain name.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:

*   **Man-in-the-middle position:** The attacker must be positioned in the network path between a client and the server to be able to intercept and alter the traffic.
*   **Ability to obtain a malicious certificate:** The attacker needs the capability to generate or obtain a certificate with a wildcard pattern that allows the impersonation of internationalized domain names that are not allowed in the RFC.
*   **Target user interaction:** In some scenarios, the user needs to enter an IDN URL, or be tricked into connecting to a server with a malicious certificate.

### Additional Details

*   The vulnerability was discovered during comparisons of wildcard matching rules of browsers for a Python issue.
*   The fix involved modifying the  `cert_TestHostName()` function in `certdb.c` to correctly handle IDNA A-labels and wildcard certificates.
*   The fix specifically adds a check to ensure that if the hostname starts with "xn--", the common name must also start with a wildcard character.
*   Multiple patches were created and reviewed to address this issue, as some of the initial patches were found to be flawed, specifically in the handling of IDNA prefixes (e.g., `xn--`).
*   The fix was pushed to NSS with the following changesets:
    *   [15ea62260c21](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/15ea62260c21)
    *  [2ffa40a3ff55](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/2ffa40a3ff55)
    *   [709d4e597979](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/709d4e597979)
*   The vulnerability is classified as "sec-moderate" and was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2014-1492.
*   The fix was implemented in NSS 3.16 and propagated to several Firefox releases, such as Firefox 29+. It was marked as "wontfix" in earlier releases (e.g., Firefox 27 and 28).
*   The fix also applies to other products using the affected NSS library, such as Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.

### Relevant Code Snippet
```c
  if (wildcard && secondcndot && secondcndot[1] && firsthndot
      && firstcndot  - wildcard  == 1 /* wildcard is last char in first component */
      && secondcndot - firstcndot > 1 /* second component is non-empty */
      && PORT_Strrchr(cn, '*') == wildcard /* only one wildcard in cn */
      && !PORT_Strncasecmp(cn, hn, wildcard - cn)
      && !PORT_Strcasecmp(firstcndot, firsthndot)
         /* If hn starts with xn--, then cn must start with wildcard */
      && (PORT_Strncasecmp(hn, "xn--", 4) || wildcard == cn)) {
      /* valid wildcard pattern match */
      return SECSuccess;
  }
```
