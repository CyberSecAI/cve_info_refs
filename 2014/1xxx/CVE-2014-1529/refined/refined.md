Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2014-1529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper security checks within the Web Notification API. Specifically, sites granted notification permissions could bypass checks on the source components, allowing scripts to run within a privileged context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Websites with notification permissions could execute scripts in a privileged context, enabling arbitrary code execution on these sites.
*   **Bypassed Security Checks:** The vulnerability exists because the Web Notification API did not properly validate the origin or safety of the source components used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected application (Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey). This means an attacker could potentially run any code on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running the application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to run code in a privileged context leads to privilege escalation, where an attacker gains higher levels of access than they should normally have.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not the primary issue, the content mentions a related vulnerability in how browser history navigations are handled, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, this is covered under a different CVE (CVE-2014-1530).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Notifications:** A malicious website, granted permission to send notifications, could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted notification that includes malicious JavaScript within the icon URL.
*  **Clickjacking:** A malicious website could also try to clickjack the notification prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Notification Permission:** The attacker needs a website that the user has explicitly granted notification permissions to.
*  **Scripting Enabled:** For Thunderbird and Seamonkey, the vulnerability is potentially exploitable in browser or browser-like contexts because scripting is disabled by default in email contexts.

**Additional Details and Context**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher Mariusz Mlynski.
*   The issue affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
*   Patches were released to address the vulnerability in Firefox 29, Firefox ESR 24.5, SeaMonkey 2.26, and Thunderbird 24.5.
* Red Hat considers this to be a **Critical** vulnerability for Firefox and **Important** for Thunderbird.
* openSUSE considers this to be a **moderate** vulnerability.
* Ubuntu considers this to be an issue that could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  The fix involves ensuring that Javascript URLs are not treated as valid image sources
*  The patch involves changing how the javascript URI is treated from 'run in sandbox' to 'do not run'
*   There is discussion about the fact that the fix should not apply a temporary fix and instead the root cause should be fixed so this type of issue doesnt reappear.
