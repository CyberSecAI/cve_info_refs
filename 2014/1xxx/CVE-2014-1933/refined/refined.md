  "cveId": "CVE-2014-1933",
  "relatedCves": [
    "CVE-2014-1932"
  ],
  "description": "The (1) JpegImagePlugin.py and (2) EpsImagePlugin.py scripts in Python Image Library (PIL) 1.1.7 and earlier and Pillow before 2.3.1 uses the names of temporary files on the command line, which makes it easier for local users to conduct symlink attacks by listing the processes.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of temporary file names generated by `tempfile.mktemp()` being passed as arguments to external processes. This is an insecure practice since command-line arguments are often visible to other local users via tools like `ps`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposing temporary file names on the command line",
      "Potential for symlink attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability through a symlink attack. By monitoring process command lines (e.g., using tools like `ps`), the attacker can identify the temporary file names used by the application. They can then create a symbolic link pointing to a file they wish to overwrite or access and wait for the vulnerable application to write to that temporary file. This would allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files or potentially obtain sensitive data within those files.",
    "attackVectors": "Local access to the system.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to observe process command lines.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability affects `JpegImagePlugin.py` and `EpsImagePlugin.py`. The vulnerability is fixed by replacing tempfile.mktemp() with tempfile.mkstemp() which creates and opens the temporary file in one go, and prevents the race condition. The fix also removes the filename argument from the command line calls using the temporary file, which prevents the commandline exposure issue."
