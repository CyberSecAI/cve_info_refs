Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way Apache Cordova's event-based bridges handle access from iframes. Specifically, a malicious script within an iframe can bypass intended restrictions. The vulnerability arises from the fact that even if the framework's utility objects are not directly accessible from an iframe, the main JavaScript objects implementing the bridge remain accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing NoBridge Property:** The intended 'NoBridge' property enforcement for event-based bridges is circumvented. Malicious code can directly access main JavaScript objects that implement the bridge, despite running within an iframe.
*   **Synchronization Issue:** Malicious code in an iframe can block for a predefined interval if it cannot receive synchronization events from the framework's local half.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Native Resources:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious script in an iframe can gain access to native resources on the device, which the application is not designed to grant to the third party content loaded in the iframe. This can be used to steal data from the device, or potentially take control of the device in worst case scenarios.
*   **Bypass of Security Mechanisms:** The iframe's ability to directly access the bridge objects bypasses the intended security controls of the application framework.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious iframes:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into an iframe loaded within a hybrid application. This could be achieved through compromised ads or other third-party content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject scripts into iframes:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content loaded within an iframe of a vulnerable Cordova application. This can be achieved by acting as a malicious advertiser, or other third party provider of content loaded into the app.
*   **Knowledge of the Cordova bridge structure:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the Cordova framework's internal JavaScript objects and how they implement the bridge.

**Summary of CVE-2014-1881**

CVE-2014-1881 is about how malicious JavaScript within an iframe in an Apache Cordova application can bypass security measures and directly access the bridge to invoke native functionality through event based bridges.
