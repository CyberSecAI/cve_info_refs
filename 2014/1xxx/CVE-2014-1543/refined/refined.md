  "response": {
    "CVE-2014-1543": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the assumption that gamepad axes are contiguous (0..numAxes), but the DirectInput API can return non-contiguous axes due to missing entries. When a device presents non-contiguous axes and the application code tries to access an axis outside of the allocated size, a heap buffer overflow occurs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow in Gamepad API due to lack of validation of axis indices.",
        "Incorrect assumption that gamepad axes are always contiguous."
      ],
      "impact": "Heap memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Crashes with virtual table pointer corruption are also observed.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious web page can trigger the vulnerability by calling navigator.getGamepads() and interacting with the gamepad API with specific gamepad configurations, either a real one or a virtual one. The attacker needs to get the user to open this page in a vulnerable browser.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page and convince a user with a vulnerable browser (Firefox 29 or 30) on Windows with either a physical or virtual gamepad attached to open it. The vJoy driver is mentioned as a means to create a virtual gamepad."
