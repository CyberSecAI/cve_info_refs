The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Eventum, including the one associated with CVE-2014-1631.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to incorrect default permissions on the installation script (`/setup/index.php`). This script is not restricted after installation and not deleted, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The setup script is accessible to unauthenticated users after installation.
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):**  Insufficient sanitization of the `hostname` parameter during installation allows for injection of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Reinstallation:** A remote attacker can access the installation script and reinstall the application.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the code injection vulnerability in conjunction with the reinstallation process, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** Vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without authentication.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/setup/index.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Eventum instance.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
- **MySQL Server Access**: To fully exploit the code injection vulnerability, the attacker requires ability to specify the address of attacker-controlled MySQL server during the reinstall process.
