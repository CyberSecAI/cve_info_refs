Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Text relocation instructions in dynamic libraries may be loaded by `dyld` (the dynamic linker) without code signature validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of code signature validation for text relocation instructions in dynamic libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code signing requirements may be bypassed. This could allow execution of unsigned or modified code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to have a dynamic library containing malicious text relocation instructions.
- The vulnerable application using `dyld` would need to load this library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to introduce a malicious dynamic library into the system's library search path.
- An attacker may need to have some level of local access in order to get the malicious library loaded by a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Apple TV and iOS.
- The fix involves ignoring text relocation instructions during the loading process, preventing the unsigned code execution.
