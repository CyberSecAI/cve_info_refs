The provided content relates to CVE-2014-1836.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an arbitrary file deletion issue in ImpressCMS versions prior to 1.3.6. Additionally, the report mentions two cross-site scripting (XSS) issues, although these were difficult to exploit due to an inbuilt protection module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability
- Two Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: An attacker could potentially delete arbitrary files on the server.
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users which could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The file deletion vulnerability is likely exploitable through a crafted request to the web application.
- The XSS vulnerabilities are exploitable through injecting malicious scripts via the web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the arbitrary file deletion, the attacker would need to send a specially crafted request.
- For the XSS, the attacker would need to inject the malicious scripts in a place that is later rendered by the web application. The attacker might need to be an authenticated user.

**Additional notes:**
- The report indicates that the XSS issues were difficult to exploit because of built-in protections.
- The vulnerabilities were fixed in ImpressCMS version 1.3.6.
- The report includes links to the full report and related issue tickets.
