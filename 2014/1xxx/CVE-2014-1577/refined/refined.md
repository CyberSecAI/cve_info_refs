  "CVE-2014-1577": {
    "description": "The mozilla::dom::OscillatorNodeEngine::ComputeCustom function in the Web Audio subsystem in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read, memory corruption, and application crash) via an invalid custom waveform that triggers a calculation of a negative frequency value.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for negative frequencies in the `mozilla::dom::OscillatorNodeEngine::ComputeCustom` function within the Web Audio subsystem. When a negative frequency is provided, the calculation results in out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
        "Memory corruption",
	"Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read leading to a crash, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution and sensitive information disclosure.",
      "attack_vector": "By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website with a malicious custom waveform.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to open a malicious web page or email with scripting enabled.",
       "affected_products": [
          "Mozilla Firefox before 33.0",
          "Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.2",
          "Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2"
