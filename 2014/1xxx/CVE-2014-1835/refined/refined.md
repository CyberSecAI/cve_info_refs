Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ruby gem `echor` exposes login credentials by including the username and password directly in the command line arguments when using `curl` in `lib/echor/backplane.rb`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Exposure of credentials in process table:** When the `curl` command is executed with the username and password as command-line arguments, these credentials become visible in the process table, which can be accessed by local users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local user can steal the login credentials by monitoring the process table. This could allow the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to observe the process table.

**Additional Notes:**

- This content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying that the vulnerability is related to the way the `curl` command is used in the `echor` gem, revealing the credentials in the process table.
- The message also mentions a separate CVE, CVE-2014-1834 for a remote command injection vulnerability within the same gem.
