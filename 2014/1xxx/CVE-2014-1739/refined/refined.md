Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-1739, extracted from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization of the `struct media_entity_desc uent` within the `media_enum_entities()` ioctl handler in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `reserved` and `raw` fields of this structure are not initialized before being copied to userland.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leak:**  The lack of initialization in the `media_enum_entities()` ioctl results in the disclosure of 200 bytes of the kernel process stack to user space. This can expose sensitive information potentially residing on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to read 200 bytes of kernel stack memory. This leaked information could potentially include sensitive data, such as memory addresses which can help in further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The vulnerability is triggered through a specific ioctl call, `MEDIA_IOC_ENUM_ENTITIES`, which is made on a media device file (e.g., `/dev/media0`).
*   **File Permissions:** The attacker requires read access to the device file (e.g., `/dev/media0`). While many distributions ship with restrictive permissions on this file, some Android devices were known to have world-readable/writable permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **File Access:** The attacker must have read access to the `/dev/media0` or equivalent device file.
*  **No special capabilities required:** No root or sudo capabilities are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affected Linux kernel versions from 2.6.38 up to 3.15-rc3
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by adding `memset(&u_ent, 0, sizeof(u_ent));` before copying to userland, explicitly zeroing the structure and preventing information leakage.
*   **Android specific concern:** Some Android devices have world-readable/writable permissions set to `/dev/media0` making them vulnerable.
