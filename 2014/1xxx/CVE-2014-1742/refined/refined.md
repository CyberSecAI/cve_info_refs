Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1742:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the editing functionality of the Blink/Webkit engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory is freed, and then accessed again, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potential for exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process. This can lead to a variety of outcomes, including complete control of the affected system.
- A denial of service can also occur as a result of the crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can trigger this vulnerability through a crafted web page or other malicious content. The user would need to interact with this malicious content through their web browser.
- The vulnerability lies within the text editing feature of the Blink/Webkit engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious content to a vulnerable user.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, meaning it is likely the vulnerability can be triggered without special permissions.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by "cloudfuzzer".
