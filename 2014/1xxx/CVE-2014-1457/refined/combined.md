Dell SecureWorks Security Advisory SWRX-2014-006

[Counter Threat Unit Research Team](/author/Counter-Threat-Unit-Research-Team) February 13, 2014
### Advisory Information

* **Title:** Open Web Analytics Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* **Advisory ID:** SWRX-2014-006
* **Date published:** Thursday, February 13, 2014
* **CVE:** CVE-2014-1457
* **CVSS v2 base score:** 5.1
* **Date of last update:** Thursday, February 13, 2014
* **Vendors contacted:** Open Web Analytics
* **Release mode:** Coordinated

### Summary

[Open Web Analytics](http://www.openwebanalytics.com/) (OWA) is open source web analytics software that can track and analyze how visitors use websites and applications. OWA is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks conducted by an unauthenticated remote attacker. The vulnerability is due to insufficiently random nonce values that are used in a CSRF prevention scheme. The web application uses these nonce values to verify client requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by predicting nonce values and persuading a user to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website.

Dell SecureWorks researchers created a proof of concept video to illustrate the vulnerability, the exploit, and its outcome.
