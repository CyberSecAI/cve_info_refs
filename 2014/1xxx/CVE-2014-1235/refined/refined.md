Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-1235:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `yyerror()` function of Graphviz. This was caused by an improper fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2014-0978). The fix introduced a new `sprintf` call that could overflow a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `yyerror()` function.
- Improper fix for a previous vulnerability led to a new exploitable issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Unspecified impact, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted input (likely a graph description file) that causes `yyerror()` to be called with excessively long strings or values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input data processed by Graphviz. This could involve providing a malicious graph file to be processed by a vulnerable application or user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `lib/cgraph/scan.l` file.
- The vulnerable code was introduced by commit `d266bb2b4154d11c27252b56d86963aef4434750`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the vulnerable `sprintf` call.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not affected because it did not include the patch that introduced the flaw.
- The issue was mitigated in some cases by `FORTIFY_SOURCE` which would cause the application to abort.
