| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 09:38:43 UTC  ``` Graphviz, a collection of tools for the manipulation and layout of graphs, was recently reported to be affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability, which seem to have introduced in the fix for [CVE-2014-0978](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0978).  References: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/46>  Commit: <https://github.com/ellson/graphviz/commit/d266bb2b4154d11c27252b56d86963aef4434750>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 09:40:57 UTC  ```  Created graphviz tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1050873](show_bug.cgi?id=1050873 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-1235 CVE-2014-1236 graphviz: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1050874](show_bug.cgi?id=1050874 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-1235 CVE-2014-1236 graphviz: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c5)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-09 20:26:48 UTC  ``` This issue would affect graphviz in Fedora and EPEL testing because they would have used the initial patch for [CVE-2014-0978](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0978).  It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of graphviz as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it did not include the patch that introduced this flaw.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c7)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 19:16:03 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.12-10.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 22:59:34 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.34.0-8.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c9)  Fedora Update System    2014-02-11 23:01:37 UTC  ``` graphviz-2.30.1-12.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1050871#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2015-05-20 11:14:03 UTC  ``` This is mitigated by FORTIFY_SOURCE to an application abort (for further explanation see [bug 1049165 comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1049165#c21 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2014-0978 graphviz: stack-based buffer overflow in yyerror()") for the original [CVE-2014-0978](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0978)).  Hence reducing impact rating.   ``` |  |
