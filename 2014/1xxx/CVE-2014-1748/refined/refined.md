Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a UI spoofing issue within the `ScrollView::paint` function in `platform/scroll/ScrollView.cpp` of the Blink rendering engine, which is part of WebKit. Specifically, the function incorrectly handles scrollbar boundaries, allowing an attacker to extend scrollbar painting into a parent frame.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- UI Spoofing: The core weakness is the ability to draw the scrollbar outside its intended boundaries, causing visual deception.
- Inadequate Bounds Checking: The root cause is the lack of proper bounds checking when rendering scrollbars.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- UI Spoofing: By drawing scrollbars outside of their normal confines, an attacker can overlay malicious content on top of the legitimate UI elements, potentially tricking the user into taking unintended actions (e.g., clicking on a fake button).
- Potential for Phishing and Social Engineering: The spoofed UI could mimic login prompts, dialogue boxes, or other elements that could be used to trick users into giving up sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Web Pages: An attacker would create a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability when a user visits the site using a vulnerable web browser.
- Malicious iframes: The vulnerability could be triggered by embedding malicious content within iframes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, Unauthenticated: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via the internet. No authentication is required.
- Medium Access Complexity: The exploit might require some degree of skill in crafting the malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability. However, the Suse information lists the access complexity as "Low."

**Additional Details**

-   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before 6.2.4, 7.x before 7.1.4, and 8.x before 8.0.4, and Google Chrome before 35.0.1916.114, and Chromium based browsers, as well as WebKitGTK+ based applications.
-   **Mitigation:** Patches were released by Apple, Google, Debian, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and SUSE.
-  **CVSS Score:**  NIST lists this as a 5.0 score with AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N. SUSE lists the CVSS v2 as 6.8 with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
-  **Severity:** This is rated as "Moderate" by both SUSE and openSUSE, with a severity of "normal" by Gentoo.
