Package        : requests
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1829 CVE-2014-1830
Debian Bug     : 733108

Jakub Wilk discovered that in requests, an HTTP library for the Python
language, authentication information was improperly handled when a
redirect occured. This would allow remote servers to obtain two
different types of sensitive information: proxy passwords from the
Proxy-Authorization header (CVE-2014-1830), or netrc passwords from
the Authorization header (CVE-2014-1829).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.

Package: python3-requests
Version: 2.0.0-1
Tags: security

If site A redirects to site B, and user had a password for site A in
their ~/.netrc, then requests would send authorization information both
to site A and to site B.

I've attached a netrc file and a pair of test scripts that should help
reproducing the bug.

> It looks like the bug was fixed upstream in 2.3.0:

Thanks for taking care of closing this. I received the notification from
github, but I will work on requests (I plan to update to 2.4.1) on the
weekend.

To acknowledge the fix of this security bug, I should put something in the
changelog anyway, right?
Something like this:
  * Acknowledge fix for [CVE-2014-1829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1829) and [CVE-2014-1830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1830) in 2.3.0-1
    (Closes: #[733108](bugreport.cgi?bug=733108))

Developer reference[¹] says: "When closing security bugs include CVE numbers
as well as the Closes: #nnnnn. This is useful for the security team to track
vulnerabilities. If an upload is made to fix the bug before the advisory ID is
known, it is encouraged to modify the historical changelog entry with the next
upload."

So using "Closes: #733108" although the bug is arleady closed seems ok to me,
is that right?

Many thanks!

Kind regards,

Hi Daniele!

As the DevRef suggests, you should retroactively add the CVE reference
to the changelog entry for 2.3.0-1, so don't mention "in 2.3.0-1".

>So using "Closes: #733108" although the bug is arleady closed seems ok

Yup, that should be fine.
