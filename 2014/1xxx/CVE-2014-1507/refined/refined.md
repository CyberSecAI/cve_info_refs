Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1507:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox OS handled relative paths within the `DeviceStorage` API. The protection against directory traversal was incorrectly implemented in the child process instead of the parent process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** A compromised child process could supply a relative path containing `../` sequences, allowing it to escape the intended storage root directory.
*   **Incorrect Process Implementation:** The check for unsafe paths was performed in the child process, which is vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker if that child process is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker with a compromised application could bypass the media sandbox and potentially read or write any file on the device. This depended on the permission level of the compromised application and the storage location.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored on the device could be accessed without authorization.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially overwrite system files depending on the exploited application's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Application:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious or compromised Firefox OS application that has device-storage permissions.
*   **Manipulated Relative Paths:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting relative file paths containing `../` sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Application:** The attacker needs to have control over a Firefox OS application with the necessary device-storage permissions.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to execute malicious code within the compromised application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mozilla developer Ben Turner.
*   The fix involves implementing the path sanitization in the parent process to prevent a compromised child process from bypassing the checks.
*   The fix was applied in Firefox OS 1.2.2 and 1.3.
*   The bug report on bugzilla mentions "This affects a compromised child" and "the child was able to send a fully qualified path to the parent" which could be seen as a form of privilege escalation.
*   The provided patch "Don't allow unsafe paths when constructing DevcieStorageFile object." effectively neutralizes the vulnerability by preventing the use of unsafe paths when constructing `DevcieStorageFile` objects.
