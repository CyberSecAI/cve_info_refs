- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SIMATIC WinCC OA integrated Web server at Port 4999/TCP might allow attackers to perform remote code execution due to improper control of generation of code. This is triggered by sending specially crafted packets without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Control of Generation of Code ("Code Injection") (CWE-94)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to perform remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets over the network to port 4999/TCP without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any authentication. A low to moderate skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
