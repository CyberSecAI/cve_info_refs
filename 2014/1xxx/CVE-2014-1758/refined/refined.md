Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Word while parsing specially crafted Office files. This can lead to system memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: The vulnerability is specifically described as a stack overflow, which occurs when a program writes beyond the allocated buffer in memory, potentially overwriting other data or code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Improper memory handling: The core issue is the lack of proper memory management when parsing specially crafted files, which leads to exploitable memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email: An attacker can send a specially crafted file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a website containing a specially crafted Office file. The attacker would then have to trick a user into visiting the malicious website and opening the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Office file that triggers the stack overflow vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either via email or a web server.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open/preview the file for the exploit to work.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Word 2003.
- This vulnerability is distinct from the Microsoft Office File Format Converter Vulnerability (CVE-2014-1757) and the Word RTF Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2014-1761), which were addressed in the same security bulletin.
- Microsoft was not aware of any public exploitation when the bulletin was initially issued.
