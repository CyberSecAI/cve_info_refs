Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-1736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an **integer overflow** within the V8 JavaScript engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the integer overflow, which occurs when a mathematical operation attempts to store a value that exceeds the maximum size of the data type used to store it. This overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact of this integer overflow is not detailed, but integer overflows in JavaScript engines like V8 can often lead to **arbitrary code execution**. This means an attacker could potentially:
    *   Execute malicious code on the user's machine.
    *   Take control of the affected system.
    *   Steal sensitive information.
    *   Cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through malicious or crafted JavaScript code executed by a vulnerable version of the V8 engine in Chrome or other chromium based browsers. This could be via:
    *   Visiting a malicious website.
    *   Opening a malicious HTML file.
    *   Interacting with a malicious web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to deliver a crafted JavaScript payload to a user using a vulnerable version of the browser. This would typically involve:
    *   Hosting malicious javascript on a website
    *   Distributing malicious javascript via an HTML file
    *   Compromising a website to inject malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by "SkyLined working with HP's Zero Day Initiative" and was classified as a "High" severity issue.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 34.0.1847.131 for Windows and Mac and 34.0.1847.132 for Linux.
*   The Debian security advisory (DSA 2920-1) also mentions this vulnerability being fixed in their chromium-browser packages.
