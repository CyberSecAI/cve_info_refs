# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisories

### Impact key

* Critical
  Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
  software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
* High
  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html) .

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2037108.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2037108.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016

[Test demonstrating the problem (GTest)](attachment.cgi?id=8486180&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8486180&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064670&attachment=8486180)

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") +++
In some contexts, such as when decoding the AlgorithmIdentifier within a PKCS#1 signature, it is critical that we minimize the variance of possible encodings that are accepted when we parse a DER-encoded data stream. Usually "minimize the variance" means "only accept the legal DER encoding of the data, and reject any overly-long encodings or any other variant." In some contexts, failing to restrict variance in accepted encodings completely undoes the cryptography. See [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing"), [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), and [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)"), for example.
See the attached test, where I demonstrate that SEC\_QuickDERDecodeItem (a.k.a. QuickDER) accepts many malformed encodings of ASN.1 lengths. Note, in particular the test case where the length of the NULL item is encoded as { 0x90, <arbitrary junk>, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }, which is wrongly interpreted by QuickDER as equivalent to { 0x00 } on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. I believe it is likely that this would facilitate the same types of attacks as described in the aforementioned bugs.
In quickder.c, the function definite\_length\_decoder is used to decode tags and lengths. It decodes the length as follows:
unsigned int data\_len;
// [...]
data\_len = buf[used\_length++];
if (data\_len&0x80)
{
int len\_count = data\_len & 0x7f;
data\_len = 0;
while (len\_count-- > 0)
{
if (used\_length >= length)
{
return NULL;
}
data\_len = (data\_len << 8) | buf[used\_length++];
}
}
Note that there is no check that the encoding of the length is the shortest necssary encoding. And also note the integer overflow of data\_len.
In the case of PKCS#1 (i.e. the aforementioned bugs), we shouldn't even be doing DER decoding in the first place. However, it isn't obvious to me yet what contexts besides PKCS#1 are also problematic, so it prudent to fix QuickDER, regardless of the fix for the PKCS#1 decoder in [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing").
The attached GTest integrates into Gecko's mozilla::pkix test suite, for my own convenience. However, it doesn't use any of the mozilla::pkix or Gecko GTest utilities, so it should be easy to integrate it into other GTest-based test suites.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: If [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") is a exploitable, critical security vulnerability then this one almost definitely is too, because these bugs (this one, [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing"), [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), and [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)")) are all instances of the same general problem.

See [bug 1064636 comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing"), where Antoine is actually exploiting \*THIS\* bug ([bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data")), not that bug ([bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing")). In particular, here is the encoded DigestInfo from Antoine's forged certificate's forged signature:

}
Notice that Antoine's test certificate doesn't even include parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier. So, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud has demonstrated that this is this bug ([bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data")) is actually exploitable in a way that will allow people to forge certificates that Firefox will then trust.
Note that even if we have removed all the 1024-bit root CAs with e=3 RSA keys, there are unknown numbers of sub-CA certificates issued by them with e=3. Also, note that any end-entity certificates may also have e=3, and so ServerKeyExchange messages in TLS are also an issue. Similarly, S/MIME. Also, the signed packaged apps CA uses e=3. Finally, note that Antoine claimed that he also created a PoC for an e=65537 public key in the other bug.Flags: needinfo?(brian)

Oops, sorry. The patches in [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") will NOT fix this bug, but they will reduce the severity of this issue.
To fix this bug, NSS can copy the logic that mozilla::pkix's DER decoder uses:
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/pkix/lib/pkixder.cpp?rev=88c41feb981d#48>
Note that mozilla::pkix's decoder only handles lengths up to 2^16-1, so the logic would need to be extended to handle longer lengths.

That brings up an interesting question, what else is the QuickDER decoder used for in NSS? I wonder if there may be some other more exciting (or at least novel) exploit to make.

Please note that there were other DER failures mentioned in [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") that need to be fixed in the patch for this bug, either that I noticed when building an exploit or from the test cases Adam provided. From the top of my head:
- length encoding can be overlong regardless of the overflow problem (03 == 81 03 == 82 00 03), i.e. this bug
- INTEGER can have arbitrary many null bytes of padding. This is wrong, there can only be one byte of padding to distinguish between negative and positive values
- BITSTRING: the unused bits are not checked, and the computed length in bits is not verified either.
- the method check for non-universal tags is probably too weak
- I don't think there is support for default values in optional components. This is required to implement DER as optional fields that are equal to their default values must be omitted
- many checks are missing for primitive types. For instance, BOOL must be either 00 of FF; object identifiers must satisfy certain requirements, TIME types must be validated...
Overall, the DER parser in PKIX appears a lot more robust, and it would make sense to port other parts of NSS that rely on DER for non-malleability to use that instead of QuickDER.

A comment in the bug isn't the right approach this, for reasons someone with "use NEEDINFO?" in their user name ought to realize. Mailing nss-dev or security-group would be a better approach.

I've found an interesting thing: after writing a routine to catch padded ASN.1 integers that aren't DER-compliant, apparently they are moderately common. There's a comment in quickder.c's DecodeItem() that says:
> /\* remove leading zeroes if the caller requested
> siUnsignedInteger
> This is to allow RSA key operations to work \*/
Assuming that to be true and unavoidable, I added an else that checks for over-long (padded) integers. A simple check of
if ( item length > 1 && ( byte[0] == 0x00 || byte[0] == 0xFF ))
{
abort
}
aborts on Firefox startup with an error that an EV certificate wasn't available; I'm not certain what certificate is the source of the problem at this point, but clearly there are some compatibility issues.
Specifically for the INTEGER type, one way through this is to look for more than one padding byte at the front (0x00 or 0xFF) and to only fail if someone is padding more than a single byte. That would still limit the danger of a malicious certificate while not breaking the apparently common single-byte padding that I'm seeing.
That's how I'll move forward for part 2 of this patch until I hear otherwise.

Please see pkixder.cpp and pkixder.h to get an idea of what workarounds you need to do to deal with invalid DER in order to be backward compatible with existing certificates. If you implement workarounds that are different than the mozilla::pkix workarounds then please highlight them, as one of the goals of the mozilla::pkix project is to serve as a reference implementation for these types of things.

Brian,
As far as I can tell, the pkixder.h implementation of Integer right now only supports parsing positive numbers between 0 and 127 (<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/pkix/lib/pkixder.h?from=pkixder.h#258>), so that's a substantially different constraint than the quickder parser.
I haven't run into anything putting constraints on INTEGER types elsewhere yet, but I will keep my eyes open.

Wan-Teh, thank you! This is why we code review. And also, I'm still getting used to there being different styles in different places. Sorry for the poor style hygiene. It will improve. Unless otherwise noted below, I took all of your changes.

It appears to be how the rest of NSS finds delineates the end-of-content, that all ASN.1 strings end with a NULL that will be read as the next tag.

It seems to appear both ways on the Internet. FWIW, Moz::pkix denies the high tags, but to-date NSS allows them. The safe way to resolve the TOODO is to remove this block. In the updated patch it will be gone (for now). Thoughts?

This patch intends to cover what Antoine brought up in [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), particularly DER-compliance for INTEGER, BIT STRING and BOOLEAN. It's a follow-on to the first patch, 8513137: bug\_1064670 (not folded).
Note that per [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), this patch has a weakened check for INTEGER DER-compliance, allowing one extra padding byte. I chose this by experimentation (since single-byte padding seems to readily exist). I worry that allowing one byte may even not be flexible enough. It may be that we need to do some certificate analysis in the population before choosing a strategy on the INTEGER validation.
The BIT STRING and BOOLEAN validations are equivalent to mozilla::pkix's approaches.Flags: needinfo?(brian)

This should be

NSS still needs to support C compilers that require declaring variables
at the beginning of a block. (We may remove this restriction soon.)

Use += here.
You misunderstood an earlier suggestion of mine. I suggested replacing += with =
in that case because we don't need to use the initial value of that variable there.
Here we need to increment the variable, so += is more concise.

My apologies; practically all of my C, C++ (and assembly) code has been for US gov't high assurance projects, where high comment-to-code ratios are mandatory. Habits die hard, as they say. I'll be less comment heavy in the future.
Thanks for taking the time to go through this with me. I appreciate your patience!
I'll be back with another updated review probably early AM tomorrow (interrupted for the afternoon).

NSS and Gecko (including mozilla::pkix) are separate products. Please file another bug in the "Core: Security:PSM" product:component for the changes to pkixder\_input\_tests.cpp, which are much appreciated. Also, please move the NSS tests from security/pkix/test/gtest to security/nss/test/<something>, for the same reason.

1. Please identify which certificate is causing the check to fail. You should be able to do this by setting a breakpoint where you put your abort(), and then looking at the stack trace to find which certificate is being parsed.
2. If the most significant bit of the first byte of a positive integer would be set (i.e. that byte's value is 0x80 or higher) then there must be a leading 0x00 to disambiguate it from a negative number. So a leading 0x00 is sometimes necessary.

I think that a stricter check will probably work: check that there's a leading zero only if the high bit of the second byte is set. See the function CertificateSerialNumber in pkixder.h:
// Check for overly-long encodings. If the first byte is 0x00 then the high
// bit on the second byte must be 1; otherwise the same \*positive\* value
// could be encoded without the leading 0x00 byte. If the first byte is 0xFF
// then the second byte must NOT have its high bit set; otherwise the same
// \*negative\* value could be encoded without the leading 0xFF byte.
if (value.GetLength() > 1) {
Reader valueInput(value);
uint8\_t firstByte;
rv = valueInput.Read(firstByte);
if (rv != Success) {
return rv;
}
uint8\_t secondByte;
rv = valueInput.Read(secondByte);
if (rv != Success) {
return rv;
}
if ((firstByte == 0x00 && (secondByte & 0x80) == 0) ||
(firstByte == 0xff && (secondByte & 0x80) != 0)) {
return Result::ERROR\_BAD\_DER;
}
}

Right. It turns out that the Integer values we care about in certificates are all very small, so I didn't bother trying to parse bigger integers in that function. Because QuickDER needs to be more general, it needs to support a larger range of values. But, other than the expanded range, I expect that it should be made to work like the functions in pkixder.h/pkixder.cpp.Flags: needinfo?(brian)

I highly recommend this document for learning the details of ASN.1 DER encoding/decoding: <http://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html>. Also, the ASN.1 reference information on Microsoft's MSDN site was very helpful to me. As a final fallback, the actual specifications for ASN.1 and DER are available for free online, but they are not as accessible as the first two. If you diverge in any way from what the Layman's Guide says, please document that divergence very clearly, as we've done in pkixder.h. I believe the main divergences that are needed are about DEFAULT values (they are not supposed to be explicitly encoded, but they often are in real-world certificates) and empty SEQUENCEs/SETs (some SEQUENCEs/SETs are defined as not being allowed to be empty, but some certificates have encoded them as empty anyway).

As for the high tag number form and indefinite encoding (which isn't even allowed in DER): I believe that it is likely that none that use QuickDER have any need for the high tag number form or indefinite encoding, so I agree that you can just hard-code simple logic to always forbid them, as we've done in mozilla::pkix.

QuickDER must forbid the indefinite length form. As for high
tag numbers, I don't think QuickDER needs to support them, but
we should detect them and return an (unsupported) error.

Sylvestre - I'm not entirely sure; I'm doing the newbie thing with moving the new unit test to NSS currently. It's my top priority, but my lack of familiarity (e.g., fighting with even the NSS/gtest build environment) is hindering making an estimate.Flags: needinfo?(jjones)

Attached patch

This patch moves the quickder code and test to properly apply to the tip of NSS as of now, and uses the ssl\_gtest to validate it. I folded Brian's test into this patch to move it to NSS as well.
I rolled in all of Wan-Teh's comments from [comment #28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c28 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data").
I am afraid I haven't addressed the INTEGER, BIT STRING or BOOLEAN issues in this patch. I still need to go through Brian's [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data") and handle the issues he identified in the "part 2", so that is not ready. Since Sylvestre is asking after the original bug, I hope this "part 1" will be close to ready to apply, and maybe I can open follow-up bugs for the new PKIX tests and the other DER compliance issues.

Brian, thank you for the helpful links on ASN.1. You're totally correct, I had forgotten about the need for a leading zero. I've verified the issues I saw with Firefox are all from certificates that needed a leading zero to indicate they were positive, so all is well.
I've adjusted the implementation of the INTEGER checks per your suggestion in [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), and this patch applies on top of the one from earlier today in NSS.
Thanks again Brian and Wah-Teh for all the help as I fumble my way around here.

Following up Wah-Teh's review, I've restructured the tests a little bit than Kai had them in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1057584#c37](/show_bug.cgi?id=1057584#c37 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add gtest framework and initial tests optionally compiled") .
Specifically, I've renamed external\_tests/ssl\_gtest to external\_tests/gtests/ and created subdirs ssl/ and asn1/. All associated scripts are updated, and I've also edited and updated the tests' README.
> I seem to remember we are following Google's C++ Style Guide for

That appears to be the intention, per the above [bug 1057584](/show_bug.cgi?id=1057584 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add gtest framework and initial tests optionally compiled") which I hadn't found until this morning. I've adjusted quickder\_unittest.cc and made minor adjustments for compliance into ssl\_loopback\_unittest.cc. (Technically, clang-format wants to adjust a bunch of spacing too).
I've addressed the other nits as well. Thanks a lot for the pointer to SEC\_ASN1\_SUB -- I had no idea that's what that did.
At this point should I open a follow-on for the INTEGER, BIT STRING and BOOLEAN compliance checks?

Please name the new directory "gtest" (singular) because "gtest" is
the name of the test framework.

That's a good idea. Your current patch should focus on the tag and length
decoding function.

Nit: perhaps "nss\_gtests" can be shortened to just "gtest"? The "nss\_" part is implied.
Or is this referring to the name of the nss\_gtest executable program?
Update: after reading the entire patch, I think this should be named "nss\_gtest". This
requires renaming the nss\_gtests.sh script to nss\_gtest.sh as well.

Now that I understand what this test case is testing, I suggest
you use exactly four 0x00 bytes at the end, because that's
sufficient to make the original quickder.c code compute a
data length of 0. (The 'data\_len' local variable is four bytes
long.)

Just wanted to stress this point: I am fine with you not renaming the
directories and scripts as I suggested in my review comments. If you
agree with the new names, you can rename them later.

Attached patch

[bug\_1064670 - be more strict on DER length decoding in quickder.c](attachment.cgi?id=8518918&action=diff)

(Carrying forward r=wtc from [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"))
Wan-Teh: I accepted all of your changes on quickder.c, they're here in the patch.
Per wtc's last [comment 43](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670#c43 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), I've moved everything that isn't the quickder.c changes into [Bug 1095118](/show_bug.cgi?id=1095118 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add ASN.1 GTest for non-DER complaint lengths"). Doing that last env variable rename spilled out to yet more files (init.sh and cert.sh), so it seemed best to just stabilize the real important part here.

I guess it doesn't hurt to have it on that branch since we may want this fixed on ESR31, but it needs to land on the 3.18 mainline for sure.

Clarification:
The patch was added to the 3.16.2 branch, but it was added on the branch after the creation of the 3.16.2.3 release.
It could potentially become part of a 3.16.2.4 release, if we decided to create one.

Lukas: It's included in NSS 3.173 ([bug 1088969](/show_bug.cgi?id=1088969 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Mozilla 36 to use NSS 3.17.3")) but that has larger changes that we probably don't want to uplift.

Thanks JC. Given that we've wontfixed it for several cycles and we're very late in the 35 cycle, it's not worth the risk to mess around here and instead let it ride to general release in 36.

### [PKCS#1 signature validation](/2014/09/26/pkcs1.html) (26 Sep 2014)

On Wednesday, Chrome and Mozilla did [coordinated](https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html) [updates](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2014/09/stable-channel-update_24.html) to fix an RSA signature verification bug in NSS — the crypto library that handles SSL in Firefox and (currently) Chrome on most platforms. The updates should be well spread now and the bug has been [detailed on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/2hd1m8/rsa_signature_forgery_in_nss/cksnr02), so I think it's safe to talk about.

(Hilariously, on the same day, *bash* turned out to have a little security issue and so hardly anyone noticed the NSS one!)

The NSS bug is another variant of Bleichenbacher's 2006 attack on RSA signature validation. To recap: an RSA signature is roughly the cube root of the message hash modulo the RSA modulus. Verification involves cubing the signature and checking that the result is the hash that you expected. Cubing modulo an RSA modulus is easy but finding a cube root is infeasible.

There's a little more to it because one needs to eliminate some properties of the RSA operation by formatting the hash that you're going to sign — called padding.

The standard for RSA signing and encryption is PKCS#1 version 1.5. The PKCS series of standards are amazing. Although I've no doubt that the people writing them were doing their best, it was a long time ago and mistakes were made. In a modern light, they are *all* completely terrible. If you wanted something that was plausible enough to be widely implemented but complex enough to ensure that cryptography would forever be hamstrung by implementation bugs, you would be hard pressed to do better. If you can find some implementers, just say "PKCS#11!" or "PKCS#12!" as punchlines. You'll get a good laugh, although possibly also a few panic attacks.

(PKCS#1 version 2 is much better, but only because they took it from Bellare and Rogaway and slapped the PKCS#1 title on it.)

PKCS#1 version 1.5 wanted to include an identifier for the hash function that's being used, inside the signature. This is a fine idea, but they did it by encoding the algorithm and hash value with ASN.1. This caused many implementations to include the complexity of an ASN.1 parser inside signature validation and that let the bugs in.

Bleichenbacher's [original attack](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html) was based on the observation that the ASN.1 parsers, in many cases, didn't reject extra trailing data. This is reasonable behaviour for a generic ASN.1 parser, but a disaster in signature verification. Because the parser could ignore so much of the signature, Bleichenbacher could arrange for a perfect cube to have a suitable prefix and thus calculate the cube root over the integers — ignoring the RSA modulus completely!

That was fixed, but there was another common bug: the ASN.1 structure used to identify the hash was a standard structure called AlgorithmIdentifier, which includes an optional parameter. Implementations were ignoring the parameter and that also introduced a vulnerability: arbitrary bytes could be inserted as a parameter and that was sufficient to forge signatures. (See section five of [this paper](https://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reports/reports/sigflaw.pdf) for details.)

This week's vulnerability was similar. Antoine Delignat-Lavaud (who, by the way, has been doing stellar work along with the [Prosecco](http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr) team at INRIA: see [Triple Handshake](https://secure-resumption.com/), [Cookie Cutter, SPDY and virtual host attacks](https://bh.ht.vc/) and [miTLS](http://www.mitls.org/wsgi/home)) noticed that the check on the contents of the parameters in NSS wasn't very strict — it was only checking that the length was at most two bytes. This is because, due to complexity, there wasn't universal agreement on what the the parameter should be. The ASN.1 for the parameter is an ANY type (with the concrete type depending on a preceding object id) but also optional. So, when not needed, should it be an ASN.1 NULL (which is two bytes long), or should it be omitted completely? The answer is the former, but it was underspecified for a long time.

Once Antoine had put a spotlight on the code, Brian Smith noticed something worse: an integer overflow in the ASN.1 parser. ASN.1 (in DER form at least, because, of course, ASN.1 has multiple defined encodings) has variable-length lengths, and NSS was using a generic ASN.1 parser which didn't check for overflow. So you could specify that a length was arbitrarily long and the parser would do something similar to:

```
unsigned length = 0;
for (i = 0; i < length_of_length; i++) {
  length <<= 8;
  length |= length[i];
}
```

Thus, as long as the last 4 or 8 bytes (depending on whether the system was 32 or 64 bit) encoded the correct length, the bytes before that would be ignored. That allows arbitrary bytes in the signature again and the attack from section 5 of [the previous paper](https://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reports/reports/sigflaw.pdf) can be still be used to make forged signatures.

(Intel's ATR group also reported the same issue to Mozilla a little bit later. Bugs often seem to work like [scientific discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery).)

#### The moral of the story

The moral here is that an ASN.1 parser should never have been put somewhere so sensitive; [parsing is dangerous](http://langsec.org/). It was a mistake to have defined PKCS#1 that way, but it can be ameliorated: rather than parsing, generate the expected signature contents and compare it against the plaintext. Go has always done this. I believe that SSH does this. Bouncy Castle reportedly does this. BoringSSL does this because I changed it from OpenSSL (prior to learning about the NSS issue — it's just a good idea). NSS does it now, although they're still worried about the omitted parameter vs NULL parameter confusion so they serialise two ASN.1 outputs and compare against both.

I generated [a number of tests](/binary/sigtests.tar.bz2) of different possible points of flexibility in signature parsing so that other libraries can be tested. For example, you can test OpenSSL (which still uses an ASN.1 parser) against them like this:

```
for cert in $(ls *.crt | grep -v root2048.crt); do
  openssl verify -CAfile root2048.crt $cert 2>> /dev/null | grep -q "$cert: OK"
  if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
    echo "$cert accepted"
  fi
done
```

The file control.crt should always be accepted. The file missingnull.crt will be accepted if you allow the parameter to be omitted. (I recommend against that. BoringSSL doesn't allow it and we'll see whether we can make that stick.) Nothing else should be accepted.

Sadly, OpenSSL 1.0.1 also accepts highvaltag.crt (ordinary ASN.1 tags in high-value form) and indeflen.crt (BER indefinite lengths rather than DER). The OpenSSL development branch also accepts bernull.crt (superfluous zero bytes in a length). To be clear, there is no known vulnerability here, but it's unwelcome flexibility in something that should be rigid. (I let OpenSSL team know on Wednesday and that they're welcome to use the code from BoringSSL.)

Remember, we use PKCS in browsers because we have to deal with the world as we find it, not as we want it. If you are not so encumbered, consider [something](http://doc.libsodium.org/) [simpler](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Fusion Middleware

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 39 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 36 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2015 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products,[My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1)

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
