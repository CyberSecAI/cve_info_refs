{
  "CVE-2014-1831": {
    "Description": "Phusion Passenger before 4.0.37 allows local users to write to certain files and directories via a symlink attack on (1) control_process.pid or a (2) generation-* file.",
    "Root cause": "The application creates a temporary directory in /tmp with a semi-predictable filename during startup, which is used to store working files. If a local attacker can predict this filename and pre-create a symlink with the same name pointing to an arbitrary directory, Passenger will write files and create subdirectories inside that target directory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of temporary files and directories",
      "Predictable file names for temporary directories",
      "Lack of proper symlink handling when creating the server instance directory",
       "Race condition between lstat and stat checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can write files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting existing files, and create subdirectories in locations they would not normally have access to.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local symlink attack via hijacking of temporary directories.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a symlink and predict the filename of the temporary directory. The attacker needs local access to the system."
