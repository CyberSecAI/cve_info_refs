Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-1811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows TCP/IP stack's improper handling of specially crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation or processing of incoming TCP/IP packets. Specifically, the TCP/IP stack fails to handle a particular sequence of malformed packets which can be leveraged by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The targeted system will stop responding.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and network-based.
- An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets to the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target.
- No authentication or prior access is needed. The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows operating systems, including Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1.
- The security update addresses the issue by modifying the way the Windows TCP/IP stack handles these specially crafted packets.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
- There were no reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited when the bulletin was issued.
