Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-1649

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ManagementAgentServer.putFile` XMLRPC method of the Symantec Workspace Streaming Agent (`as_agent.exe`). This method allows for uploading arbitrary files to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The `putFile` method does not require authentication, allowing remote attackers to upload files without valid credentials.
- **Insecure XMLRPC Method:** The XMLRPC interface exposes a method that allows for the writing of arbitrary files to the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `putFile` method doesn't properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to specify the destination path of the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious WAR file to the JBoss auto-deploy directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This is achieved by abusing the auto-deploy feature in the JBoss instance (`as_ste.exe`).
- **Configuration Overwrite:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite configuration files of the Symantec Workspace Streaming server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM allows an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending crafted XMLRPC requests to the vulnerable service.
- **XMLRPC:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted XMLRPC request to the `as_agent.exe` service on port 9855 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system running the Symantec Workspace Streaming Agent service.
- **Ability to Craft XMLRPC Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific XMLRPC request to exploit the `putFile` method, using the `ManagementAgentServer.putFile` method.
- **Knowledge of Deployment Path:** While the Metasploit module attempts to leak the JBoss deployment path, an attacker with prior knowledge can use a hardcoded path.
- **Exploitation Chain:** The exploit requires two steps, first using `ManagementAgentServer.putFile` to upload a malicious WAR file to the JBoss deployment directory, and then triggering the WAR file using a separate request to execute the code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Metasploit module leverages the `getFile` XMLRPC method to leak the JBoss deployment path.
- The vulnerability exists in Symantec Workspace Streaming 6.1 SP8 and has been confirmed on Windows 2003 SP2. However, other versions may be affected.
- A patch from Symantec is available to correct the vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS has a filter ID ['13556'] to protect against this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod).
