Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Request_Curl` class in FuelPHP. Specifically, the auto-formatting mechanism of cURL responses can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. When a cURL request is made to a potentially malicious URL, or a compromised website, the response's content might be crafted to exploit the auto-formatting process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated cURL Responses:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper validation of responses received via cURL requests. The application automatically processes and formats these responses without ensuring they are safe.
*   **Insecure Auto-Formatting:** The auto-formatting feature in `Request_Curl` interprets the response, potentially executing malicious code embedded within it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious response from a website controlled by the attacker, or by exploiting a compromised website.
*   **File Deletion:** In addition to code execution, the vulnerability can be used to delete arbitrary files on the application server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the application, causing it to make a cURL request to the attacker's server.
*   **Compromised Website:** The application may make a request to a legitimate website that has been compromised, with the compromised site returning a malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make the application send a cURL request to a malicious or compromised server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs to understand how the auto-formatting mechanism works in `Request_Curl` to craft a malicious response.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects FuelPHP versions 1.1 through 1.7.1.
*   The provided documentation links to a fix that disables auto-formatting by default, requiring developers to explicitly enable it with caution and to add response validation.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity by JVN iPedia with a base score of 5.1.
*   The issue was reported by Masaaki Chida of GREE, Inc. to IPA.
