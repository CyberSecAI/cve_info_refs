# JVN#94791545 FuelPHP vulnerable to remote code execution

## Overview

FuelPHP contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an issue in the Request\_Curl class.

## Products Affected

FuelPHP applications that are created using the following versions are affected:

* FuelPHP versions 1.1 through 1.7.1

## Description

FuelPHP is a PHP web framework for creating web applications. FuelPHP applications contain an issue in the Request\_Curl class, which may result in arbitrary code execution.

## Impact

When specially crafted input is processed, arbitrary files may be deleted or arbitrary code may be executed on the application server.

## Solution

**Update to the latest version of the framework and address any applications that use the Request\_Curl class**
Update the framework to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.
After updating, search for all controllers in the application that use the Request\_Curl class. For each instance found, verify if the response from the cURL call can be trusted. If so, auto formatting can be enabled on the instance manually. If not, validation code needs to be added to validate the response received after executing the request. After succesful validation auto formatting can be enabled and set\_response() can be called manually to construct the response in the correct format.

The developer has provided [documentation](http://fuelphp.com/dev-docs/classes/request/curl.html#/method_set_auto_format) on the safety implications of these settings.

# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

IT Security Center

Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

# Security Advisories

##### Reported or discovered security issues. Did you discover one? Use the contact form to report it, so it can be addressed.

##### Updated: 17-04-2018

#### Security Advisories

### **SEC-CORE-009**: Unzip vulnerable to slip-zip attack

When extracting a ZIP file using the Unzip class, a prepared zip file could overwrite arbitrary files as the basedir wasn't enforced.

**All released versions starting with 1.0 are affected**. The issue is addressed in release v1.8.1.6. You can modify earlier versions by implementing the changes from [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/95945e137a4cd28696860dccfeadbb3f0a3e9a1c).

### **SEC-CORE-008**: Crypt encryption compromised

With the right knowledge, code, and GPU calculation power, Crypt encryption can be broken in minutes.

**All released versions starting with 1.0 are affected**. The issue will be addressed in release v1.8.1. You can modify earlier versions by implementing the changes from [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/59112c96d0a6f2b0ead6a57edd8ac465678bdcb0), and install the "paragonie/sodium-compat" composer package if you are on PHP < 7.2.

### **SEC-CORE-007**: ImageMagick driver does not escape all shell arguments

This vulnerability may cause OS commands to be executed when you pass unvalidated image filenames containing specially crafted strings to the ImageMagick driver.

**All released versions starting with 1.1 are affected**. The issue will be addressed in hotfix v1.8.0.4. You can modify ealier versions by implementing the changes from [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/95c134e9e087f3c4523fe6cd86ed4e9e1e7af91c).

### **SEC-CORE-006**: Monolog version used has vulnerabilities

The default composer.json file installs Monolog v1.5, which contains known vulnerabilities. Monolog will be upgraded to v1.18 in the next release. You can do this yourself now by manually changing your composer.json, and run "composer update".

Kenji Suzuki

<= 1.8.0

### **SEC-CORE-005**: specially crafted sessions can cause access to files via path traveral

Using a special crafted cURL request it is under strict conditions possible to access arbitrary files the webserver has access to. This requires you to use file-based sessions, a specific directory to exist on your server, and session payload encryption to be switched off.

**All released versions starting with 1.0 are affected**. Given the severity, this will been addressed in next release. You can modify current and earlier versions by applying [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/1fe9c89c0f4d60be2900488f871f8c41234b80d9).

Takayuki Uchiyama (JPCERT/CC)

<= 1.7.3
t.b.a.

### **SEC-CORE-004**: auto-format of Curl responses may lead to code execution

When executing a cURL request using the Request\_Curl class with an unvalidated URL provided by user input, or a request to a malicious or a legitimate but hacked website, a specially crafted response can lead to auto-execution of malicious code, due to the way the auto formatting mechanism works.

**All released versions starting with 1.1 are affected**. This will been addressed in the 1.7.2 codebase, where the default will be changed to not automatically format the response. This can be modified in earlier versions by applying [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/8bb42dcf5edaa6787516a22f1b1660a8ef34a98a).

Since this will disable auto-format, you have to scan your code for instances of Request\_Curl, and either use set\_format(true) to re-enable auto-formatting on a per instance basis (only do this if you are **absolutely sure** you can trust the source of the response), or add additional code after the execute() call to validate the contents of the response body, and convert it to the correct format manually only after succesful validation.

[CVE-2014-1999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1999)

### **SEC-CORE-003**: $\_GET not cleaned when parsed from REQUEST\_URI

When none of the default methods of determining the request URI have succeeded, the framework will fallback to parsing the raw request URI as passed by the webserver. If this URI has a query string, it will be parsed and $\_GET will be updated. In this process, the $\_GET variables are not cleaned, making it possible to inject malicious data.

**All released versions are affected**. This will been addressed in the 1.7.1 codebase, and can be fixed in earlier versions by applying [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/aab6b1541afe410c088c26c83edb5c0a9b779d3b)

### **SEC-CORE-002**: xss\_clean() doesn't clean unicode EM-spaces

On some browsers, this can cause javascript execution if send unencoded to the browser. Since FuelPHP encodes everything send to a view by default, we don't think it's an immediate risk.

**All released versions are affected**. XSS cleaning in FuelPHP is done by the external library htmlLawed. We have been in contact with the author, who has fixed this in release [v1.1.16](http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/). This release is included in the 1.7 codebasse. You can upgrade manually by replacing "./fuel/core/vendor/htmlawed/htmlawed.php" (note the lowercase!)

<= 1.6.1

### **SEC-CORE-001**: DB quote\_identifier(), possible injection

The method "quote\_identifier()" which is used in the DB class to make sure identifiers are quoted can be vulnerable for injection if uncleaned GET variables are passed to it, due to the way preg\_replace() has been used with the "/e" modifier.

**All released versions are affected**. This has been addressed in the 1.7 codebase, and can be fixed in earlier versions by applying [this change](https://github.com/fuel/core/commit/270ba79b39e93317e88260a162872ea48e8cfb2c).

*[Harro Verton](http://wanwizard.eu/)

**Project Lead***

Continuity, Framework Architecture, Framework Core libraries

Harro Verton has been programming for more than 30 years, when he got hold of a TRS80. He started his professional development career writing IBM mainframe assembler.

Via a short stint writing mainframe Cobol, he moved into writing in C, developing software to integrate the mainframe and PC world, mainly writing drivers for network operating systems like Novell Netware and Banyan Vines. This caused a gradual carreer shift from programming into networking. WanWizard is now professionally active as infrastructure architect.

However, the programming virus has never left him. At the end of the last century he picked up programming again, and decided to go for the then upcomming language for the web, PHP. And he's been developing applications in PHP ever since.

*Emlyn West

**Core Developer***

ORM, Fieldset, Validation

After being active in the community for quite some time, Emlyn officially joined the team of Core Developers in November 2013.

Emlyn started out working on the ORM, for which he introduced the Soft and Temporal models. Soon after that he started picking up some version 2 work, notably the Fieldset and Validation packages. The quality of his work wasn't missed by the team, and shortly after the introduction of the new Validation code, Emlyn has formally asked to become an official core developer. Having graduated university Emlyn stepped right into developer role and has not looked back since.

#### Alumni

Unfortunately, people move on. We would like to thank these former members of the team, without them FuelPHP wouldn't be what it is today.

*Márk Sági-Kazár

**Core Developer***

Email

Coming from CodeIgniter, Mark picked up FuelPHP in 2011. Since 2014, he actively develops for FuelPHP, starting with the Email package.

Mark started to play with programming at the age of 6. While in high school, he worked with several Microsoft languages, amongst them Visual Basic. After finishing high school, he switched to PHP as his program language of choice. Starting with CodeIgniter, he quickly switched to FuelPHP, and delivered his first production appliaction (an eCommerce site) in 2012, followed by IndigoPHP in 2013, an application framework and CMS build on top of FuelPHP. Besides his work on FuelPHP v2, he's currently working on some good quality packages like a supervisor client, queue manager, shopping cart abstraction, to name some.

**Core Developer***

After being the "Docs Guy" for a couple of months Frank joined the team of Core Developers in September 2011.

While having a background in design his main focus has been writing code ever since he laid his eyes on the web. Frank mainly develops sites for creative agencies. When he's not working or contributing to the framework, he works on tiny projects like [Snipr.it](http://snipr.it/).

![jelmer.jpg](https://fuelphp.com/addons/shared_addons/themes/fuel/img/jelmer.jpg)

*[Jelmer Schreuder](http://jelmerschreuder.nl/)

**Core Developer***

Jelmer was introduced to the internet early and build his very first website at age 12, years before his parents would give him internet privileges.

It would take another five years to start making some money, but ever since early 1999 he's been writing PHP. In 2006 he was introduced to CodeIgniter which became his framework of choice for the next couple of years. He developed a closed source CMS which he licences as SaaS, while at the same time contributing back parts of it to the community. In the middle of 2010 he was in search of a new framework, having tried writing his own and trying many others he settled on bugging Dan on IRC about Fuel.
