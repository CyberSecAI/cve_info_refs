Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the `_position_down_id` HTTP POST parameter in the `/dg-admin/index.php` script of doorGets CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of proper sanitization of the `_position_down_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated user via a CSRF attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries in the application's database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Reading sensitive data from the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Possibly gaining higher access levels within the application or the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/dg-admin/index.php` script with a malicious SQL query embedded within the `_position_down_id` parameter.
- **CSRF:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking an authenticated administrator into submitting the crafted POST request, even without the administrator's knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable doorGets CMS instance.
- **CSRF attack:** The attacker needs a way to trick a logged in administrator into making the vulnerable request (ex: a malicious link)

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) using a CSRF attack and DNS exfiltration to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The provided PoC specifically targets Windows systems due to the use of the `load_file()` function for DNS exfiltration. It shows a form that when submitted will exfiltrate the database version.
- The vendor patched the vulnerability on January 15, 2014, directly in the source code.
