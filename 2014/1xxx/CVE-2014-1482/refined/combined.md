## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen and Sotaro Ikeda

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.

([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

Fabián Cuchietti and Ateeq ur Rehman Khan discovered that it was possible

to bypass Javascript execution restrictions when replying to or forwarding

mail messages in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to steal confidential information or modify message content.

([CVE-2013-6674](/security/CVE-2013-6674))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-04

## Incorrect use of discarded images by RasterImage

Announced
February 4, 2014
Reporter
Fredrik Lönnqvist
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 27
* Firefox ESR 24.3
* SeaMonkey 2.24
* Thunderbird 24.3

### Description

**Fredrik 'Flonka' Lönnqvist** discovered an issue with image
decoding in `RasterImage` caused by continued use of discarded
images. This could allow for the writing to unowned memory and a potentially
exploitable crash.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Image decoding causing FireFox to crash with Goo Create

Core
Shared components used by Firefox and other Mozilla software, including handling of Web content; Gecko, HTML, CSS, layout, DOM, scripts, images, networking, etc. Issues with web page layout probably go here, while Firefox user interface issues belong in the [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox) product.

[Component:](/describecomponents.cgi?product=Core&component=Graphics%3A%20ImageLib#Graphics%3A%20ImageLib)

Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

2. Create a new project by clicking on the "create new project" button on the bottom right of the "manage projects" dialog which is popped up upon logging in.
3. Click on the red asset library button in the bottom right, and click on the zombie or goon to add either of them to the scene. (A model with textures is needed)
4. Using the menu bar on the left side of the screen, find and click the material button to open up the material panel. (shiny sphere icon in the middle)
5. On the right top menu, under the project header, find and click the display textures button to be able to view the textures in the current project. (checkered square icon).
6. Click on the now visible textures , may have to click between them swiftly. In some cases it instantly craches, in some cases after a few clicks.
Actual results:
FireFox crashes (shuts down instantly), followed by a dialog for submitting a crash report.
Expected results:
I should still be in Goo Create, with the material panel showing settings and a preview image of the selected texture.

It looks to me in most of these crash reports like we're attempting to access an imgFrame that's already been freed. Quite concerning. We've seen a number of bugs lately that result from inadequate locking in RasterImage/Decoder/etc., especially on error-related code paths, and this is very possibly another of those cases. Being cautious and treating this as a security bug (thanks Daniel!) until we understand the cause.

Seth, given that this is in image decoding, is your fix in [bug 896268](/show_bug.cgi?id=896268 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: NS_IsMainThread() and crash [@mozilla::image::Decoder::AllocateFrame]") connected to this one here?

I suspect that I know the origin of this problem, because I have found a \_severe\_ design flaw in RasterImage that pretty much throws all of our invariants out the window. I'm fixing a special case of it in [bug 896268](/show_bug.cgi?id=896268 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: NS_IsMainThread() and crash [@mozilla::image::Decoder::AllocateFrame]"), because there is a special-case fix there that actually makes the code cleaner anyway.
However, the general solution is that we need to use recursive locking for mDecodingMutex in RasterImage so that we do not have to unlock while sending notifications. This is the only good option. The other three options, for reference, are:
(1) Never synchronously notify, which will hurt our page load performance.
(2) Radically rewrite RasterImage to be more safe for concurrency and parallelism using fine-grained locking. In the long term, sure, this might be a better choice. It's also a huge undertaking and a potential quagmire. Even if we ultimately want to do this, I don't think this is realistic as a solution to our immediate problems.
(3) Keep crashing. =(
I'll cook up a patch shortly that switches RasterImage over to use ReentrantMonitor. I'm currently (perhaps over-optimistically) hoping that this can be accomplished without too much pain.

Attached patch

[Use a reentrant monitor instead of unlocking for notifications in RasterImage.](attachment.cgi?id=8346976&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8346976&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=943803&attachment=8346976)

In this patch I've replaced RasterImage::mDecodingMutex with a ReentrantMonitor. This eliminates the requirement that we unlock before sending notifications, which was necessary because notifications could cause calls back into RasterImage to methods that would acquire the lock.
As usual recursive locking is not to be used without good reason, but until such time as we significant refactoring in RasterImage, this is the safest path forward. I strongly suspect that the crash in this bug has at its root the fact that we unlock to send notifications, which breaks every invariant that we use the decoding mutex to maintain. This patch will eliminate that problem and will thus solve not only this issue, but other mysterious imagelib crashes. The same issue has been confirmed to be the root cause of [bug 896268](/show_bug.cgi?id=896268 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: NS_IsMainThread() and crash [@mozilla::image::Decoder::AllocateFrame]"), which is much easier to reproduce.

Attached patch

[Don't force discard images when they have a decoder open.](attachment.cgi?id=8350418&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8350418&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=943803&attachment=8350418)

I reproduced the crash and determined that there is an additional problem. We are displaying the same image on the page twice, once as a WebGL texture with non-premultiplied alpha and once as a content image with premultiplied alpha. Because we only store one decoded version of the image at a time, whenever we try to draw the content version of the image it kicks out the WebGL version, and vice versa. This causes us to want to ForceDiscard() twice in a short span of time, but CanForciblyDiscard() doesn't make sure the image is fully decoded, so when we do so the second time we hit an assert in debug builds (because the decoder is still open) or a crash in release builds.
This patch just makes CanForciblyDiscard() return false if the image is not fully decoded.

Don't force discard images when they have a decoder open.
So if we do call Discard from Draw then it looks like we will null out mDecodeRequest in Discard, but the thread in Discard doesn't own mDecodingMonitor. That seems like the larger correctness issue that we need to fix.

The crash reports show we're writing to unowned memory which is usually an exploitable security problem. The ones I saw, though, are "near null" which generally isn't exploitable IFF it's guaranteed the bug always happens with a null pointer (plus fixed offset) not some other bogus value.Keywords: [verifyme](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verifyme&resolution=---) → [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---)

If mDecoder is null (like the NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE's at the start of RasterImage::Discard) guarantee then there probably can't be decoder threads around, so we are probably the only thread that can acquire the monitor in that situation. But that invariant is not easy to show is true. There is a ton of access to the "locked" members as RasterImage.h claims that is completely unlocked. None of them seemed like they were an immediate problem. I tried adding all the required locks (and asserting elsewhere) but I ran into a problem. We technically need to lock in RasterImage::Discard. RasterImage::Discard is called from DiscardTracker functions that own the list mutex for the discard tracker. So in order to prevent deadlock we want to enforce that we acquire the discard tracker list mutex before the RasterImage monitor, never after. (We have asserts that check this). But we also have call chains like RasterImage::ShutdownDecoder (which asserts it is in the monitor) -> Decoder::Finish -> RasterImage::DecodingComplete -> DiscardTracker::Reset which needs to acquire the discard tracker list mutex. Untangling that so that the Reset call happens outside of the monitor is tricky, and likely makes the code harder to understand. And that is just the first call chain I came across.

Hello Timothy! Glad to inform you that I could not reproduce the texture preview crash with that build of the nightly (firefox-29.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe used).
Do you have any estimate of when this fix will reach the stable version of firefox?Flags: needinfo?(flonka)

Given the sec-crit nature, this happening with a tool that advertise ourselves via the gaming contest, and the fact that we seem to have a patch that helps, requesting tracking all the way up to current beta (27).
Fredrik, if the patch can get into the current beta, this fix should be in stable/release in February.

check mDecoder
It's not clear to me that this patch actually fixes a security problem. So I'm guessing the first patch that landed in this bug fixed the sec crash (but we still crashed in a different way), and this patch fixes a crash that doesn't appear to be sec. Since this is still a sec bug, out of caution, I will use the sec-approval process.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
A smart person could realize that there is a problem when using an image as both a regular image and as a texture in webgl if they understood the code, although that is not directly clear. I'm not sure what other specifics are needed to make this crash. Although it seems like this is a safe crash to me.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The checkin comment basically describes the code change, no more, no less.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This specific code has been like this for a while, I think it's the same on all currently supported branches, so this specific problem has existed for quite a while. However, [bug 716140](/show_bug.cgi?id=716140 "VERIFIED FIXED - Multithreaded image decoding") (multi threaded image decoding) (which has target milestone 22) probably made this more likely to come up. Other code changes also could have made this more likely to happen, I haven't put any time into determining exactly what exposed this old issue.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
See previous answer.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Trivial to create.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
In the situations where this patch would change behaviour we would have hit an NS\_ABORT\_IF\_ELSE, so it should be mostly upside with the patch after it is verified that it fixes the initial bug.

The try build from [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=943803#c27 "VERIFIED FIXED - Image decoding causing FireFox to crash with Goo Create") also had the patch for [bug 958758](/show_bug.cgi?id=958758 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebGL ABORT: Calling InitDecoder() but already decoded!: '!mDecoded'") in it. It would be useful to know if we should expedite that patch as well, or if just this patch fixes the problems you are seeing.

If this isn't a sec-critical at all, we should re-rate this. If you aren't even sure if this is still a security issue, it is hard to see it as critical.

It probably was sec-critical, but the first patch that landed from his bug fixed that aspect of it (however a safe crash remained).

It's confusing, but there are two patches. The second fixes an issue which is likely not sec-critical. The first patch looks like it does fix a sec-critical issue.

IMO the reentrant monitor patch is not all that risky to uplift. On Windows our mutexes are recursive by default anyway, so we've had essentially the same situation on our most important platform for quite some time now.

Use a reentrant monitor instead of unlocking for notifications in RasterImage.
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): The root cause is [bug 716140](/show_bug.cgi?id=716140 "VERIFIED FIXED - Multithreaded image decoding").
User impact if declined: Crashes, memory corruption. Bad news.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): On m-c for 1 month.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Fairly low risk. On Windows we were already using recursive mutexes, so the real impact is restricted to moving an additional chunk of code inside the lock. If this introduced a deadlock I suspect we would have encountered it in the past month, given how hot this code path is.
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: None.

Agreed that the second is probably not sec-critical but it \*does\* solve a crash, and a crash in a product that we promote and partner with. IMO it's worth pushing to beta if it sticks around on m-c for a while with no issues. I'm inclined to request uplift on Monday.

And I agree with Seth - esp. as this crash has erratic signatures and therefore is hard to track, we'd like to have it resolved as soon as it's reasonable, ideally in 27.

Use a reentrant monitor instead of unlocking for notifications in RasterImage.
Approving given the low-risk and as it resolves a crasher.
:seth I would like this to get in tomorrow's beta 8 but don't think the sheriff will be around to land it due to US holiday.

check mDecoder
If we are landing the first patch for the last better I think the ideal thing to do would be to land this patch as well (if we are planning on landing it anyway, may as well do it sooner rather than later). A few days on m-c is enough testing.
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): revealed by the first patch in this bug
User impact if declined: crash sometimes when webgl uses images as textures
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): been on m-c
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): we add two conditions to an if, if those conditions don't pass we will call NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE in ForceDiscard on the next line, so this is almost a no brainer, shouldn't make anything worse.
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: none

Based on [comment 33](/show_bug.cgi?id=943803#c33 "VERIFIED FIXED - Image decoding causing FireFox to crash with Goo Create"), this affects esr24 as well, so we probably need to backport there as well. Timothy, what about b2g18 (v1.1)? From what you're saying, it might be possibly affected as well (albeit not as easily)? We are still backporting security fixes to that branch, so please let us know :)

Actually before multi-threaded image decoding ([bug 716140](/show_bug.cgi?id=716140 "VERIFIED FIXED - Multithreaded image decoding")) we obviously didn't even have locking at all, so where ever that landed is where we need this.

This landed in 22 - so I guess esr24 is affected but b2g18 not.

The first patch fixing a potential sec-critical does not affect b2g18. The second patch, fixing a safe crash, might affect b2g18. But I think the situation may come up a lot less frequently (or not at all?) before multi-threaded image decoding ([bug 716140](/show_bug.cgi?id=716140 "VERIFIED FIXED - Multithreaded image decoding")) (and possibly other more recent landings have made it more likely to occur as well). I'm not sure what the criteria are for b2g18, so could someone please tell me if the second patch meets them.
Similarly for esr24, we want the first patch for the sec critical, but do we want the second patch which fixes the safe crash that we will get after that is fixed?Flags: needinfo?(tnikkel) → needinfo?(abillings)

Use a reentrant monitor instead of unlocking for notifications in RasterImage.
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-critical
User impact if declined: Crashes and/or memory corruption.
Fix Landed on Version: 27
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Fairly low risk. On Windows we were already using recursive mutexes, so the real impact is restricted to moving an additional chunk of code inside the lock. If this introduced a deadlock I suspect we would have encountered it in the past month, given how hot this code path is.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None.

The crash is expected, no? In [comment 68](/show_bug.cgi?id=943803#c68 "VERIFIED FIXED - Image decoding causing FireFox to crash with Goo Create"), you only approved the security fix for esr24, not the crash fix.Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm) → needinfo?(abillings)

The first four are access violation read at 0x24, so probably safe I'm guessing.
These last two are access violation write at 0x1822d000 and 0x1cb79000. Sounds unsafe. They happen on the decoding thread. The safe crash that the "check mDecoder" patch prevents is on the main thread. So if a decoder thread is able to make progress before the main thread crashes it looks like we can unsafely crash here.
So I think we need to re-evaluate and do further uplift of the "check mDecoder" patch.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

check mDecoder
[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: More crashes, possibly severe security ones
Fix Landed on Version: 27 and on
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): This is a low-risk patch
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none
On mainline (Firefox 27 and up) we've taken a 2-part fix, but on ESR-24 we only took the larger part. We're still seeing scary crashes with this bug's STR on ESR-24 and it's /possible/ -- not guaranteed -- that the missing part will help. This patch is small, safe, and tested on mozilla-central through beta. We know it will make ESR-24 less crashy and given the smallness of the patch we probably shouldn't have skipped it in the first place.

## Synopsis

Critical: firefox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0132)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error messages related to web
workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy,
which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox. When combined with other
vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security implications.
(CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly handled window
objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain security
checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 24.3.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 24.3.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-2102-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced a

regression which could make Firefox crash under some circumstances. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060945#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 01:57:39 UTC  ``` Security researcher Arthur Gerkis, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, reported a use-after-free during image processing from sites with specific content types in concert with the imgRequestProxy function. This causes a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

# BMO

From MozillaWiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This is the main public page for all things related to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>, aka BMO, Mozilla's customized version of [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org).

BMO is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. It is used to track not only bugs and feature requests but also many other tasks across various teams.

The BMO source is a slightly modified fork of Bugzilla with many custom extensions. It is currently based on Bugzilla 4.2 but with many features backported from 4.4 and master. All the BMO devs are also involved in the Bugzilla project, and we contribute features and fixes upstream where they are generally applicable, that is, not too specific to Mozilla's particular needs.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

# B-Team

The team that works on BMO is called the B-Team, because of past affiliation with the defunct Automation and Tools team (A-Team).

* dkl: Dave Lawrence (Owner/Engineer)
* glob (Manager)

The Low-level, security, and quality tools team contributes tooling, and development:

* calixte: Calixte Denizet, (AutoNag)
* marco: Marco Castelluccio, (BugBug)

We also also have some volunteers, that we consider to be part of the B-Team as well:

* seban: Sebastin Santy (long-term volunteer, past GSoC student)
* atoll: Richard Solderberg (Reviewer-at-Large, slightly borrowed from Mozilla IT)
* kohei: Kohei Yoshino, (UX Designer)
* *... and you can be one too!*

There are also some people that still have some involvement with BMO,
but their day-to-day attention is directed to other parts of Mozilla.

* zeid: Zeid Zabaneh (Engineer)

Past contributors include:

* mary: Mary Umoh (Intern, Summer 2017)
* gerv: Gervase Markham
* mcote: Mark Côté
* dylan: Dylan Hardison
* imadueme: Israel Madueme (Engineer)
* justdave: Dave Miller

# New Users

Getting used to Bugzilla can be a bit daunting. We have a short [introductory video](https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6) available that is as gentle as possible. You may also be interested in the [[MDN section about Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Bugzilla)], which contains information more suitable as an introduction to a general audience. Of special interest is the MDN article, [What to do and what not to do in Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/What_to_do_and_what_not_to_do_in_Bugzilla), which contains instructions on getting elevated privileges.

# New Bots

If you have a bot that uses BMO, be sure to add it to the [BMO/Bot Registry](/BMO/Bot_Registry "BMO/Bot Registry")
so we know who to contact about it!

# User Guide

We're putting together a [user guide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide") with helpful information on various aspects of Bugzilla. New and experienced users alike should benefit from it. There's a lot to go through, so please feel free to contribute!

# Road Map

We keep a yearly [road map](/BMO/Road_Map "BMO/Road Map") with our medium-term plans (1-2 years), at a high level. Also see our [current projects](/BMO#Current_Projects "BMO") for some of the big items we are working on in the current quarter.

# Browser Support For BMO

Full Support includes: The current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, and Edge; and the latest Firefox ESR.

Limited Support includes: The previous versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, Edge, and Firefox ESR; and Firefox Nightly.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported, though some features may still work with IE 11.

See [bug 1359310](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359310) and [bug 1422435](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422435).

## JavaScript and Analytics

JavaScript is required to use bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The `Do Not Track` header sent by your browser is honored.

# Third-Party Applications

Lots and lots of web apps and general tools have been written to interface with BMO. We have started [cataloguing them](/BMO/ThirdPartyApps "BMO/ThirdPartyApps"). If you're looking for different ways to interface with BMO, check it out; similarly, if you are thinking about writing an app, check the catalogue to see if something similar exists that you could use, contribute to, or fork before setting out on your own.

There's one in particular that is particularly important: [Phabricator](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html), Mozilla's new and growing code-review tool.

# More Information about BMO

Our discussion forum is mozilla.tools.bmo [[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-bmo)] [[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.tools.bmo)] [USENET].

We also have answers to [Frequently Asked Questions](/BMO/FAQ "BMO/FAQ") and a slightly-but-not-too-out-of-date [hardware diagram](http://people.mozilla.org/~justdave/BugzillaPhysicalDiagram-rev110504.png).

If you're building an application or tool that interfaces with BMO, you may be interested in the following:

* [Best practices and etiquette](/BMO/Integration_Best_Practice "BMO/Integration Best Practice") for integrating external apps with BMO
* Info and plans on Bugzilla's [REST API](/Bugzilla%3AREST_API "Bugzilla:REST API"), and the older, deprecated [BzAPI](/Bugzilla%3ABzAPI "Bugzilla:BzAPI").

Looking for another way to access Bugzilla's raw data? Try the [ElasticSearch cluster](/BMO/ElasticSearch "BMO/ElasticSearch").

# Contributing to BMO

If you'd like to help out with BMO specifically (as opposed to the general upstream [Bugzilla project](/Bugzilla "Bugzilla")), you can find us in #bmo on irc.mozilla.org. If you plan on contributing patches, see the documentation in the [README.rst](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/blob/master/README.rst). You can file bugs under the [bugzilla.mozilla.org product](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org). Don't file them under the Bugzilla product unless you are sure it's a bug in the general Bugzilla product. In particular, all administrative changes should be filed under bugzilla.mozilla.org (see below for more).

# Policies and Procedures

## Code Updates

Code updates are normally deployed to bugzilla.mozilla.org late Monday/early Tuesday, US/Pacific time, at no specific time, if changes need to be pushed out. Security fixes or other fatal type errors will always go out as soon as possible.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [BMO/Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

## Administrative Changes

If you need changes to BMO's configuration to support your team, project, etc., please consult this page before filing bugs:

* [General information on requesting Changes to BMO](/BMO/Requesting_Changes "BMO/Requesting Changes")

## BMO Administrative Processes

* [Adding a new product](/BMO/new-product "BMO/new-product")
* [Adding a new "rapid release" version](/BMO/new-version "BMO/new-version")
* [Adding a new BMO security group](/BMO/new-security-group "BMO/new-security-group")
* [Retiring Products and Components](/BMO/RetiringComponents "BMO/RetiringComponents"): moving things to the Graveyard classification.
* [Restoring Disabled Accounts](/BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts "BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts")
* [Merging Accounts](/index.php?title=BMO/MergingAccounts&action=edit&redlink=1 "BMO/MergingAccounts (page does not exist)")
* [Disabling Accounts](/BMO/DisablingAccounts "BMO/DisablingAccounts")

See also [BMO on Mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45845955) (requires LDAP).

## BMO Development and Other Processes

* [Overall Development Processes](/BMO/Development_Processes "BMO/Development Processes")

* [Planning a BMO outage](/BMO/OutagePlanning "BMO/OutagePlanning")
* [Reset the development branch to master](/BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch "BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch")
* [Maintaining Perl Dependencies for BMO](/BMO/Perl_Dependencies "BMO/Perl Dependencies")

## Custom Bug Entry Forms

In the past, BMO developers supported writing custom bug entry forms specific for the needs of different projects and groups within Mozilla. In order to focus more on other important features, we will no longer be providing that support going forward. For more information on why this change was made, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools.bmo/tp4dSwUfKSA).

There is a new [custom form framework](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/custom-form-example) being developed by an outside contributor named Sebastin Santy. It is still in the early stages but it eventually will be very useful for users who want to create a customized bug entry form that can be used to submit bugs to BMO.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1477 CVE-2014-1479 CVE-2014-1481 CVE-2014-1482
                 CVE-2014-1486 CVE-2014-1487 CVE-2014-1490 CVE-2014-1491

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.

This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0133)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled error messages related to
web workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
policy, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird. When combined with
other vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security
implications. (CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly handled
window objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain
security checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.3.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.3.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
