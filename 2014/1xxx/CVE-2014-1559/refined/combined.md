# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-65

## Certificate parsing broken by non-standard character encoding

Announced
July 22, 2014
Reporter
Christian Holler
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 31
* Thunderbird 31

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **Christian Holler** discovered
several issues while fuzzing the parsing of SSL certificates. Two of these
issues were a result of using characters that are not UTF-8 in certificates when
various functions expected all strings to be UTF-8 format. The third issue was a
result of using characters that were not ASCII in certificates while a function
expected only ASCII formatted text. All of these issues causes the certificates
to be incorrectly parsed, leading to a potential inability to use valid SSL
certificates.

This issue is similar to [bug 1015973](/show_bug.cgi?id=1015973 "VERIFIED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file ../../../dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 422") but has a different cause according to [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!!

Well, it looks like a couple of things are wrong here:
1. nsStdURLParser::ParseURL shouldn't be happy parsing a url like '[http:\257/ocsp.verisign.com](http:///%5C257/ocsp.verisign.com)' (it ends up saying the host is '\257'
2. nsDNSService::AsyncResolve does this:
683 nsAutoCString hostACE;
684 if (idn && !IsASCII(\*hostPtr)) {
685 if (NS\_SUCCEEDED(idn->ConvertUTF8toACE(\*hostPtr, hostACE)))
686 hostPtr = &hostACE;
687 }
It probably shouldn't assume that a string is automatically UTF8 if it isn't ASCII.
Also, I discovered plenty of places in nsNSSCertHelper.cpp that make similar mistakes (i.e. assuming something is ASCII or UTF8 without actually checking).

Patrick - is there someone on the networking team that can work on this? Basically what's happening is PSM is opening a channel for an OCSP request to a url specified in a certificate which is causing problems (see [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427")). (The issues in nsNSSCertHelper.cpp can be dealt with separately.)Flags: needinfo?(mcmanus)

I'm happy to look into the issue.
It's also interesting that clicking on the link '[http:\257/ocsp.verisign.com](http:///%5C257/ocsp.verisign.com)' and copying it in another tab leads to different behaviours (first goes to \257 the second to www..com/ocsp... )

that seems right. We certainly don't handle any other cases now (I don't believe there are other legitimate cases, but I'm not positive). so fixing the precondition checks on the existing code is the right thing.

Check string is UTF8
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily, considering javascript strings are utf16, and the code path isn't obvious.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No. While it's expected that the string should be UTF8, the method of triggering the assertion isn't obvious.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
In all supported branches. Blame lists [Bug 542222](/show_bug.cgi?id=542222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Reduce recursion in makefiles") but the code is a lot older than that.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?

How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely to cause regressions, as there is no relevant change in functionality.

Thanks Ryan. I had requested approval for that one because it's the one that can be applied to aurora/beta. Sorry if that's not the correct procedure.

The way I did it was to set up a https website using nginx, with the specified certificate, and alias uwl.weblio.jp to localhost, then access it.
I think decoder had a slightly different method, but this one works too.

Thanks Valentin.
I was able to add the cert to a local apache instance, set up the hosts file to mimic that cert's domain, and connected successfully to my local site. I had to override an error message, as the cert itself is not trusted, but after that, no crash.
decoder - let me know if there's a better way to reproduce this.

I've tried going through this using nodejs + express and couldn't reproduce the issue either. Used the cert from [comment # 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427") and created a localhost using port 8000. Once accessed, I received an error message indicating that the cert wasn't trusted. After that, I couldn't reproduce the crash either.

I tried the following:
- installed nginx via Ubuntu 14.10
- changed -> ssl\_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/mutant1542.pem; (under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled)
- changed -> ssl\_certificate\_key /etc/nginx/ssl/mutant1542.pem; (under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled)
- Added "127.0.0.1 uwl.weblio.jp" into /etc/hosts
- Visiting <https://uwl.weblio.jp> would direct me to an "Untrusted website Exception" page
- Once the certificate was confirmed, <https://localhost> loaded without any crashes/issues
Valentin, does this seem correct? I've used linux asan builds from around June 12, June 16 and June 25.. Downloaded them from:

I just saw this old needinfo for verification. This is a typical example for a bug that should not require manual verification at all. There is a simple testcase attached, which can be used in an xpcshell test to verify that the assertion does not happen anymore. You don't even need to add a complicated full-browser test for this. I suggest the developers add this test as a regression test.Flags: needinfo?(choller)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

```

All seamonkey-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How do you know the encoding of certName is UTF-8? IIRC, there are several possible encodings and it isn't clear how to know which one it is.
Also, if certName is the result of CERT\_GetCommonName then it might not even be a domain name, in which case we shouldn't display it.
Internally, when we match names, aren't we doing the name matching in CERT\_on the assumption that the names are ASCII? See CERT\_VerifyCertName and cert\_TestHostName. If so then it seems wrong to be decoding UTF-8 here.

test1.pem
Looking at the certificate, there is not subjectAltName and the CN is not a domain name or an IPv4 or IPv6 address; it's "CN=AC Raíz Certicámara S.A.". Thus, it shouldn't be listed as a domain name in this message. (The full subject name is "CN=AC Raíz Certicámara S.A.;O=Sociedad Cameral de Certificación Digital - Certicámara S.A.;C=CO".)

cleanup-names (v2)
AFAICT, this patch is not correct for the reasons I gave above: (1) It isn't any more correct to assume UTF-8 than it was to assume ASCII, AFAICT; (2) We shouldn't be assuming the common name is a domain name or IP address without testing it. Also, (3) in the case of a certificate that is not valid for any domain names, we shouldn't allow the cert error override UI.

Thanks for your time an insight brian. I is always refreshing. Unfortunately
I only say your feedback after I had landed this to central.
Let me reply by parts
1. In this case we are reading the subject's common name, it is more correct to assume
it utf8 than ascii, as utf8 encodings (the rfc states that conforming CAs MUST use
PrintableString or UTF8String encoding) so it it better, Not perfect. I think
this as an intermediate step is a good change.
2. Agreed
3. Agreed with you
So I propose: let this patch stay on central (and be uplifted to aurora/beta) and
file a new bug to address issues 2 and 3( to improve UI errors on
bad invalid cert domain (we might need a new i10n string?)).
We can also reopen this.

There's no sec rating here and it's not obvious how far back this goes - is ESR24 affected and does this need to be uplifted? Keep in mind that FF31 (where this is fixed) is the next ESR version.

No it has been in the code since 2008.

decoder, how did you load this cert? I've tried hosting it on a site as well as manually importing it, but neither causes a crash, only errors.
If you have instructions on how to verify, I'd be happy to do that. Or if you can easily verify the fix yourself, that would be good too. Either way. Thanks.Flags: needinfo?(choller)
