Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-1591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Firefox, specifically the C++ backend introduced in Firefox 33, had a flaw in how it handled redirects when generating violation reports. The `blocked-uri` parameter in the report was including path and query string parameters of the redirected URL instead of just the origin. This reintroduced a vulnerability similar to one fixed previously in Firefox 14 (CVE-2012-1963), indicating a regression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:**  The primary weakness was the inclusion of the full redirected URL (including path and query parameters) in the CSP violation report's `blocked-uri`.
- **Cross-Origin Information Exposure:**  This information leak occurred even when the redirect target was a different origin, exposing potentially sensitive data from other sites.
- **Regression:** The issue was a regression, meaning a fix from a previous issue (CVE-2012-1963) was reintroduced with a new implementation of CSP in C++.
- **Incomplete Spec Implementation:** The implementation did not fully comply with the CSP specification, which mandates that only the origin of the blocked URI should be included in violation reports after a redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially obtain sensitive information like usernames, session identifiers, OAuth tokens, or other data present in the redirected URL's path or query parameters.
- **Phishing:** Malicious sites could use this vulnerability in phishing attacks to identify users who visited them, potentially enabling targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious website with an `object` tag pointing to a resource on another domain. If the resource redirects, the vulnerable browser would send a CSP violation report revealing data about the redirected URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker only needs to host a malicious webpage.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the malicious page in a vulnerable browser.
- **Knowledge of Redirects:** The attacker needs to set up a scenario where a resource on another domain will cause a redirect.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack doesn't require any user authentication

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved ensuring that the `blocked-uri` parameter in CSP violation reports only contains the origin (prepath) of the redirected resource, as specified by the CSP specification.
- Patches were created and applied to multiple Firefox versions (34, 35, 36) and Firefox OS 2.2.
- The vulnerability was assigned a severity of "sec-high" by Mozilla and considered a regression.
- The fix was initially landed in mozilla-inbound and uplifted to Aurora and Beta release channels.
- The fix was later backported to other affected branches (b2g-v2.1 and b2g-v2.2).
- The reporter of the bug, Muneaki Nishimura, was awarded a security bounty for reporting the issue.
- Test cases were also created to prevent future regressions.
- The fix also addressed another issue where the document-uri in the report was not correct.
