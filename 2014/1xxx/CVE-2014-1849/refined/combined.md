CVE-2014-1849 Foscam Dynamic DNS predictable credentials vulnerability

Date Published: 05-08-2014

Class: Design error

Remotely Exploitable: yes

Vulnerability Description:

Foscam IP camera vendor provides a Dynamic DNS (DynDNS) service. Every
Foscam camera has a preassigned FQDN of
xx####.myfoscam.org<<http://xxyyyy.myfoscam.org/>> format,
where 'x' is an alphabetic ASCII character and '#' is a digit. Each camera
has a unique host name associated with it. That host name is flashed into
the camera memory and is printed on a sticker on the bottom of the camera.
The corresponding unique entry is created in Foscam DNS server for every
manufactured camera. If the Foscam DynDNS option on the camera is enabled
then that entry is updated with the current IP address of the user on every
camera boot.

For updating DNS entries Foscam employs a custom protocol over UDP. This
custom protocol uses the camera subdomain as a username and password to
verify the authenticity of the request thus making it possible for an
attacker to overwrite an arbitrary camera record in the Foscam DNS server.
Existing setup doesn't have a mechanism to change the username/password
neither on DynDNS nor on the camera.

Several attack scenarios are possible using this vulnerability:

- Attacking the camera: rewrite the DNS entry to point to fake camera login
page to steal credentials/respond with HTTP 401 to capture credentials
cached by the browser

- Attacking the browser: set up a reverse proxy that injects script element
in the original response pointing to malicious script to do ui redress
attacks, hook with BeEF, etc.

- Attacking third party website: rewrite multiple DynDNS records to a
victim IP address and HTTP request flood DDoS. Not confirmed, as our ISP
filters IP packets with spoofed source. UDP proxies to the rescue, may be

With >250K active DynDNS entries, it looks quite promising.

Report timeline:

* January 30th, 2014 - Foscam was notified

* February 6th, 2014 - Vendor acknowledges the receipt of the email and
asks for technical details

* February 19th, 2014 - Vendor contacted again and asked to confirm the
vulnerability

* February 19th, 2014 - Vendor acknowledges the vulnerability and outlines
the plan to address the issue. Vendor asks to withhold the disclosure until
May 1st, 2014 so that the fix can be rolled out.

* April 30th, 2014 - Vendor notifies that newly manufactured cameras will
contain the fix. Vendor confirms that the existing cameras will not be
fixed.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
