| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1059410#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-29 19:55:42 UTC  ``` These aren't security flaws, precisely, due to some of the other defaults that Fedora has that other distros/vendors may not, but upstream recently did some hardening to the defaults they provide (and we don't change) based on Martin Carpenter's report.   <https://git.enlightenment.org/core/enlightenment.git/commit/?id=9456e88504cb5daddbac3f49373a3a9a8577e27a> commit 9456e88504cb5daddbac3f49373a3a9a8577e27a Author: Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman) <raster> Date:   Fri Dec 6 09:19:08 2013 +0900      e_sys - fix busy spin problem with security clamp-down   <https://git.enlightenment.org/core/enlightenment.git/commit/?id=666df815cd86a50343859bce36c5cf968c5f38b0> commit 666df815cd86a50343859bce36c5cf968c5f38b0 Author: Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman) <raster> Date:   Sun Dec 1 11:48:49 2013 +0900      e_sys - address security concerns with environment - more      add more environment variables to nuke and add alternate envrionment     nuke method to raise security level.   <https://git.enlightenment.org/core/enlightenment.git/commit/?id=bb4a21e98656fe2c7d98ba2163e6defe9a630e2b> commit bb4a21e98656fe2c7d98ba2163e6defe9a630e2b Author: Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman) <raster> Date:   Sat Nov 30 22:26:30 2013 +0900      e_sys - address security concerns with environment and gdb      1. clear out environment as best is possible before executing     anything. especially PATH and IFS are set to minimal base defaults.     also use clearenv() if available and unsetenv()      2. remove gdb method as it's just too dangerous. run it as normal as     the user and if the kernel / distro dny that - then sorry. too bad.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1059410#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-05 16:26:23 UTC  ``` Just to note that these issues received two CVE names from MITRE [1]:  >  1. clear out environment as best is possible before executing >     anything. especially PATH and IFS are set to minimal base defaults. >     also use clearenv() if available and unsetenv()  Use [CVE-2014-1845](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1845) for this issue in which the environment isn't properly restricted.   > 2. remove gdb method as it's just too dangerous. run it as normal as >    the user and if the kernel / distro dny that - then sorry. too bad.  Use [CVE-2014-1846](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1846) for this issue in which gdb is available unsafely in the unpatched codebase.  [1] <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/03/19>  These issues do not affect Fedora in any significant way, so the filing of this bug is to include these as hardening (so as to prevent a user/admin from shooting their own foot) but not necessarily because we ship Fedora in a vulnerable way.  I'm adding the CVEs as aliases to this bug only because it makes it easy to find the bug due to the association, not because this affects Fedora as a security flaw.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1059410#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2015-05-29 10:44:12 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 20 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 20. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '20'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 20 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1059410#c3)  Fedora End Of Life    2015-06-29 14:52:02 UTC  ``` Fedora 20 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2015-06-23. Fedora 20 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |

No one from another distribution responded with specific details that were
different from this "aren't security flaws, precisely" statement.
So, we will make the CVE assignments on the basis of the original report.

Use CVE-2014-1845 for this issue in which the environment isn't
properly restricted.

Use CVE-2014-1846 for this issue in which gdb is available unsafely in
the unpatched codebase.

In this interpretation, "and (b) a weak default configuration. Users
in select groups could exploit this to execute arbitrary programs as
root" means that at least one not-equivalent-to-root user is able to
execute the helper program. In other words, it is not an independent
vulnerability.

A specific Linux distribution might, for example, have an
implementation error in determining who is allowed to execute the
helper program. If anything like that is reported, additional CVE
assignments would be possible.
