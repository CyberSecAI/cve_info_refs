- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `paratrooper-pingdom` Ruby gem uses the `curl` command within the `setup` and `teardown` functions to interact with the Pingdom API. The API key, username, and password are included directly in the `curl` command as command-line arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is that the API credentials (API key, username, and password) are exposed as command-line arguments to the `curl` process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user with access to the system can monitor the process tree and extract the API key, username, and password. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to the Pingdom account and potentially perform actions on the monitored services.
- **Attack vectors:** Monitoring the process tree of the running ruby application/script using `paratrooper-pingdom`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to monitor the process tree on the system where the Ruby gem is being used. This typically means they require some level of local access to the system where the application runs.
