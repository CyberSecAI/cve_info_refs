Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1978:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way NTT DOCOMO's "sp mode mail" application handles data exchange with external applications during email creation. When a user selects an application to link with, the email content and any attachments are saved to the SD card. This data is then accessible to other Android applications due to insufficient access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Data Storage:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive email data (including content and attachments) on the SD card without proper access restrictions. This makes the data accessible to other applications installed on the same device.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The application fails to implement proper access control mechanisms to protect the stored email data, leading to a confidentiality breach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious Android application, if installed on the device, can access and obtain the contents of emails being created by the user. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious Android application being installed on the user's device. This application then gains access to the exposed email data stored on the SD card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious App Installation:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application on their Android device.
*   **SD Card Access:** The malicious application must have the necessary permissions to read files from the SD card.
*   **No specific position or authentication is required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any malicious app once installed on the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor states that they will not be providing a patch, and instead provide a warning message.
*   The analysis by JPCERT/CC considers the exploit complexity to be "Mid-High", as it would require some expertise to craft a working exploit, and user interaction by convincing the user to install the malicious app, rated as "Low".
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 2.6 (Low).
