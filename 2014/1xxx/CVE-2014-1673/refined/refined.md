Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-1673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Check Point Session Authentication agent versions 4.1 and higher utilize anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suites for SSL communication, which do not provide peer authentication. This means neither the agent nor the gateway authenticates the other during the SSL handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Peer Authentication:** The primary weakness is the use of anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5, TLS_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5, TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA, TLS_DH_anon_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA, TLS_DH_anon_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA) which don't require mutual authentication.
*   **Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** The lack of peer authentication allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate security gateway and establish an encrypted communication channel with the agent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Stealing:** An attacker can impersonate the security gateway and prompt the user for their login credentials. The attacker can then intercept and steal these credentials.
*   **Control of Agent:** The attacker gains control of the agent through the encrypted channel and can perform actions such as prompting for user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack occurs over the network by establishing a connection with the Session Authentication agent.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the agent and the legitimate gateway or to be able to directly connect to the agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to connect to the machine where the Session Authentication agent is running. This could be achieved by being on the same network or by having network access through other means.
*   **MitM Position (potentially):** If the attacker is not directly connecting to the agent, they need to be in a position to intercept traffic between the agent and the real security gateway.
*   **Agent accessibility:** In some scenarios, the agent might be configured to allow connections from any IP address ("Allow any IP" option). If the agent has IP restrictions, the attacker would need to bypass those.

**Additional details:**
The provided text also contains a proof-of-concept script that simulates a security gateway to demonstrate the vulnerability. The vendor was informed, but stated that due to a small user base, and the introduction of newer technology, legacy session authentication would be deprecated rather than patched in a timely manner.
