# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*

# [CVE-2014-1673] Check Point Session Authentication Agent vulnerability

---

*From*: Jakub Jozwiak <jozwiack () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 27 Jan 2014 21:57:28 +0000

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Product Information
- -------------------

Check Point Session Authentication agent is a service that is installed on
endpoint system in order to communicate with security gateway and allow it to
request and obtain user's credentials. Session Authentication is a part of
Legacy Authentication suite which provides different authentication methods to
allow or deny access to network resources.

R76 Security Gateway Technical Administration Guide[1] defines typical Session
Authentication operation in the following way:

    1. The user initiates a connection directly to the server
    2. The Security Gateway intercepts the connection
    3. The Session Authentication agent challenges the user for authentication
       data and returns this information to the gateway
    4. If the authentication is successful, the Security Gateway allows the
       connection to pass through the gateway and continue to the target server

Issue description
- -----------------

Check Point Session Authentication agent version 4.1 and higher contains a flaw
which is caused by lack of peer authentication in SSL communication. Encrypted
communication between agent and security gateway has been introduced due to
several issues (e.g. [2], [3]) which were revealed in the previous versions
(4.0 and lower) of the product. Research showed that it is still possible to
exploit previously known vulnerabilities - gateway impersonation and credential
stealing - even though communication between agent and security gateway is
utilizing SSL.

Communication between Session Authentication agent and security gateway is
performed using proprietary protocol. Since version 4.1 this communication
scheme uses SSL as an underlying protocol to enable encryption of both protocol
commands and user provided data. When SSL communication is negotiated between
gateway and agent following cipher suites are visible in SSL Client Hello
message as supported by Session Authentication agent:

    TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
    TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

RFC2246 refers to listed cipher suites:

    "The following cipher suites are used for completely anonymous
    Diffie-Hellman communications in which neither party is
    authenticated. Note that this mode is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
    attacks and is therefore deprecated."

Taking into account above information it's possible to connect to Session
Authentication agent from attacker's machine, initiate SSL-based communication,
pass SSL handshake without being authenticated and use encrypted channel to
control agent (e.g. prompt user for login and password).

For attack to be successful attacker's machine must be allowed to connect to
machine on which agent is running. Newer versions of Session Authentication
agent include option to define three IP addresses which are allowed to issue
authentication requests to agent. When this option is used it limits possibility
of exploitation. Agent software has also "Allow any IP" option - when enabled
attacker doesn't need to take additional measures in order to be able to connect
to agent.

Proof of Concept
- ----------------

Attached PoC script simulates security gateway and allows credential stealing to
be performed over encrypted communication channel against Session Authentication
agent version 4.1 or higher.

Affected versions
- -----------------

Check Point Session Authentication agent, version 4.1 and higher

Vendor response
- ---------------

Vendor has been informed about the issue on 8/8/2013. On 14/8/2013 vendor
informed about expected fix date: 15/10/2013. On 28/10/2013 vendor informed that
due to small user base and introduction of the Identity Awareness Software
Blade[4] legacy session authentication will be deprecated in the major release
of 2014.

Additionally vendor published SecureKnowledge article[5].

Credits
- -------

It should be noted that this finding is partially based on work of
individuals who reported issues in the previous versions of Session
Authentication agent as referenced in [2] and [3].
