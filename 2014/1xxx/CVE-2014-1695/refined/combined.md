##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Success Stories

[SIEVERS-GROUP](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

The challenge

Continuous improvement is the credo of the SIEVERS-GROUP: support should be more efficient and of a higher quality for customers. It also strives to optimize the services and products provided. In order to be able to control these factors in a targeted manner, the relevant KPIs (key performance indicators) first had to be made visible and measurable.

1.200 tickets per month

90 agents

The solution

This has now been achieved. “With the help of OTRS, we were able to model and implement standardized processes for ticket processing throughout the company,” reports Henrik Kindt. This results in two key advantages: First, thanks to OTRS, it is possible to communicate with customers much more transparently and efficiently. Secondly, by measuring relevant KPIs, the SIEVERS-GROUP is able to monitor its service quality in a targeted manner and improve it immediately if necessary.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[DLRG](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

With OTRS as our central helpdesk solution, we can respond quickly to inquiries and offer our volunteers a first-class service.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

The challenge

The DLRG teams are spread across Germany. They need fast IT service and use a variety of hardware.

2,000 tickets per month

126 agents

The solution

With OTRS as a central software solution, those responsible can improve IT service delivery through excellent organization and quick request processing.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[H. Gautzsch Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The customization options were important in our decision for OTRS. The price-performance ratio then tipped the scales.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The Challenge

Sales teams did not have a sufficient overview of customer inquiries and processes, sometimes duplicating work.

7000 tickets per month

30 agents

The Solution

OTRS provides an organized overview of all processes and their processing status, and it has noticeably increased efficiency.

Solution[Customer Service & Support](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/customer-service-support/)[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[ALPHA COM](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

Optimally structured communication and efficient support for greater customer and employee satisfaction at ALPHA COM Deutschland GmbH with OTRS

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

The Challenge

The ITSM solution used until 2017 was technologically insufficient as a support solution. It lacked transparency, led to communication outside the tool, and employees who were dissatisfied with the interface.

2,000 tickets per month

50 agents

The Solution

High transparency in inquiry handling, efficient escalation processes and structured communication – the use of OTRS leads to increased service quality and satisfied employees and customers.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[MET Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

Switching from ((OTRS)) Community Edition to the OTRS enterprise help desk solution improves CSAT and enables proactivity at a great value

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

The Challenge

The company was growing. It was time to evolve – from an open source ticketing system to an enterprise help desk solution – in order to better meet the growing needs of customers, management and IT.

1,000+ tickets per month

12 agents

The Solution

The customizable OTRS help desk solution was selected and support was added.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
