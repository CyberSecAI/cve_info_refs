Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within SOY CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a classic XSS issue, which allows the injection of arbitrary scripts into web pages rendered by SOY CMS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If a user views a page containing the malicious script while logged into SOY CMS, the attacker's script will be executed in the context of the user's browser session. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Data theft
*   Malicious actions performed on behalf of the user
*   Defacement of the website
*   Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to inject malicious script into a SOY CMS page. This script will execute when a victim visits the crafted page while logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a page accessible by users of the vulnerable SOY CMS installation.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability itself according to the CVSS vector string.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS score is relatively low (2.6), due to the high complexity.
*   The affected versions include SOY CMS Ver. 1.4.0c and earlier.
