Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the rexx Recruitment user registration page. The application fails to properly filter user-supplied input when pre-populating form fields after a submission error. Specifically, the application does not remove or sanitize HTML5 event handlers within the input, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The application inadequately filters user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application's domain.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to filter some characters like '<' and known event handlers like `onmouseover`, but it doesn't effectively block all malicious input, especially HTML5 event handlers like "oninput" and crafted "onfocus" events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
*   **Website Manipulation:** Attackers can fully manipulate the website's appearance, add malicious content, and potentially hijack user sessions.
*   **User Tracking:** Attackers could track user interactions and potentially steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** An attacker can create a URL with a payload injected into a registration parameter. The vulnerable application will then reflect this back in the registration form, triggering the JavaScript.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can persuade victims to click a specially crafted link or redirect them to it, resulting in the execution of malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft URLs:** Attackers need to be able to manipulate the registration URL by inserting malicious JavaScript code in query parameters.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** Attackers need the capability to convince users to click malicious links in order to execute the crafted javascript in their browser.

**Additional Details:**
* The application attempts to sanitize input by removing certain characters and event handlers, but it fails to recognize and filter HTML5 event handlers, leading to the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is triggered when the web application repopulates form fields, thus executing the malicious code.
* RedTeam Pentesting identified the vulnerability during a penetration test.
* The vendor released fixed versions R6.1 and R7 on 2014-01-15

This vulnerability is classified as high risk due to the potential for complete website manipulation and user tracking.
