- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iThoughtsHD application fails to sanitize map names before displaying them, specifically when using the WiFi browser transfer feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that will execute when a user views the files through the WiFi sharing feature, potentially leading to malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a file with a malicious script within its name through the iThoughtsHD web server's WiFi transfer feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device running the iThoughtsHD application, and the WiFi transfer feature of the application needs to be enabled. The attacker also needs to be able to upload a file with a malicious name through the web interface.
