- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A kernel pointer stored in an IOKit object could be retrieved from userland.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure, specifically of a kernel pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can read a kernel pointer, which can be used to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). This bypass weakens the security of the system, making other potential exploits easier to carry out.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the system.
