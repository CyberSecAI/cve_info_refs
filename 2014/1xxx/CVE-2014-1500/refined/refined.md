Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1500:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way JavaScript `onbeforeunload` events interact with page navigation. By using `onbeforeunload` to trigger a navigation event (like a reload) repeatedly, an attacker can create a loop that prevents a user from closing a malicious page's tab.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is that the `onbeforeunload` event handler allows modifications to the current document's location, leading to an infinite loop.
- The lack of proper control over the execution of the `onbeforeunload` handler, specifically navigation within the handler.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The continuous execution of JavaScript and page reloads consumes browser resources, causing the browser to become unresponsive.
-   **Inability to close tab:** Users are unable to close the malicious tab, effectively trapping them on the page, and preventing them from exiting the application normally.
-   **Resource consumption:** The loop can consume significant system resources, potentially impacting the overall performance of the user's device.

**Attack vectors:**
-   A malicious website can exploit this vulnerability.
-   A user must visit the attacker's crafted malicious web page in order to be impacted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to have the ability to host a malicious webpage with the exploit code
-   No special position or network access is required
-   The user has to visit the crafted website, so a form of social engineering could be involved.

**Technical Details:**
The malicious code uses a combination of the `onbeforeunload` event and a navigation trigger such as location.reload(). The onbeforeunload event is fired when a user attempts to close the tab, navigate away from the page, or reload the page. The code uses the onbeforeunload event to call reload. This causes the browser to repeatedly refresh the page, triggering the onbeforeunload event again, and creating an endless loop that keeps the user trapped and prevents them from closing the tab.
```html
<script>onbeforeunload=function(){location.reload();return "internetwache.org"};onload=function(){location.reload();}</script>
```
The fix for this issue prevents navigation during the onbeforeunload event, addressing the root cause of the loop and preventing the DoS. This was accomplished by checking the state of onbeforeunload handlers in the docshell.

The bug report also notes that form submissions during `onbeforeunload` events can behave unexpectedly but that this was deemed outside the scope of this specific vulnerability's fix.

This vulnerability has been addressed in Firefox 28 and later, as well as SeaMonkey 2.25 and later.
