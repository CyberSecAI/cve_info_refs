From: Intel Product Security Incident Response Team
<Intel.Product.Security.Incident.Response.Team@intel.com>
To: "'security@mozilla.org'" <security@mozilla.org>
Subject: NSS Issue
------/------
Intel Security’s Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team has discovered a variant of the signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher, which enables this attack to be used to forge RSA certificates on multiple crypto libraries with incorrect implementation of verification. Due to the way affected libraries parse BER encoded fields, it is possible for an attacker to skip garbage bytes, enabling signature forgery. These attacks target RSA keys with a low exponent (such as 3). The vulnerability is due to the implementation of signature checking in particular crypto libraries; each library must be assessed separately for the conditions that allow for the issue. For that reason, the Intel ATR team continues to assess many other libraries.
Intel's ATR team has recently determined Mozilla NSS to be vulnerable, and the team has a proof of concept using Firefox root certificates. Details are in the attached document.
NOTE: This vulnerability has not been shared publicly, but the team plans to publish eventually. Because a large number of people/products may embed vulnerable libraries and thereby be affected by this issue, Intel PSIRT has requested that CERT/CC lead the coordination of this issue and assign CVEs. They will likely contact you shortly.
Please contact Intel PSIRT at secure@intel.com for updates or additional information. Our PGP key can be retrieved from our website <https://security-center.intel.com/PGPPublicKey.aspx>.
Thank you,

It seems other people are aware that many implementations have these issues. In the attachment, they describe exactly [bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data") and [bug 1067214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1067214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Certificate (and other) RSA PKCS#1 signature verification doesn't enforce a minimum of 8 padding bytes"). It clearly took Intel quite a bit of time to prepare the attached report, so I guess they've known about it for a while.Depends on: [CVE-2014-1569](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), [CVE-2014-1570](/show_bug.cgi?id=1067214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Certificate (and other) RSA PKCS#1 signature verification doesn't enforce a minimum of 8 padding bytes"), [CVE-2014-1568](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing")

Since July, according to them.

We've known about the general issue from looking at other libraries since July. We only became aware that NSS was affected more recently. In mid July, the Intel ATR team discovered the variant of Daniel Bleichenbacher's attack from 2006 which is enabled by incorrect parsing of ASN.1 encoded DigestInfo. Since then, the team has reviewed the implementations of many libraries in order to determine if they are affected.
Intel has made several non-public disclosures on this issue since September 3. Upon discovering the same issue in NSS, we became concerned that many parties may be affected. As a result, we have been attempting to start industry-wide coordination of the issue, so that affected parties will be aware of the need to quickly update products that embed the NSS crypto library. We provided information to CERT/CC on Sept 17, 2014. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear back from them.

Intel: who else is affected? We know that OpenSSL accepts high-valued tags at least but doesn't allow unlimited overflow so hopefully that's not critical. But we would want to know before we release updates for FF and Chrome and shine a large spotlight on the issue.

I take that back. At some point in 2006 or so, the parsing was changed from the old ASN.1 parser to QuickDER. I don't know if the old ASN.1 parser has the same problems. However, I think for your purposes of determining what Firefox/FirefoxOS/Thunderbird releases are affected, it is fair to say this has been in the product "forever."

For coordination purposes, we need to have a common publication date that we can tell all affected parties. What is the present thinking regarding when NSS can have an update ready? Are we planning to publish full details at that time or can we wait a bit to give other affected projects some time? We are meeting with CERT on Monday, and this would be helpful info. Similarly, if there is anything else we should relay to CERT regarding parties that should be contacted or anything else, just let me know.
Also, is there any way to share an early patch with others who may embed NSS into other applications, giving them a chance to prepare?

I believe that was changed as part of <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-60.html> (that is, [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)"), [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), and [bug 351848](/show_bug.cgi?id=351848 "RESOLVED FIXED - DecryptSigBlock does not check the message digest's length is correct")).

We were planning on landing the patches Monday and releasing on Tuesday, although that was after testing other browsers and not finding any affected by the same issue (other than Chrome on Linux? Chrome on Windows is OK). We had not thought about non-browser, non-openssl libraries.

We wouldn't publish full bug details for several weeks to help protect slow updaters, but the patch alone may be revealing enough.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Chrome is affected on all platforms except Android. Even though certificate verification might not be affected on Windows and OS X, verification of ServerKeyExchange messages is. (Additionally, we can't patch on Linux because we use the system libnss.)
I fear that Tuesday might be a quick since you're only giving notice now. If nothing else, I think you need to alert distros that an important NSS update is coming on Sept 2${x}th at a given time. If you plan on that being Tuesday then that notice should go out Monday morning. (If you don't have distro contacts to hand, please let me know; someone here certainly does.)

tracking-firefox-esr24 is affected too even if the tracking flags are not up to date and we will do a
Firefox ESR 24.8.1.
Daniel, it would be nice to warn distributors about this by the normal channel. For example, Debian security team is not aware of this issue yet and libnss is used a lot (libreoffice, chromium, openjdk, evolution, etc).
If needed, just like Adam, I can forward the information to the Debian security team (I know many folks there) and they can take care of forwarding the info to the other distributions.

Is Wednesday better then? There's some concerns that we don't want to slip to Thursday since that's the start of Rosh Hashanah and we'll be missing some folks (and other orgs might be as well).

I'll check here, but provisionally, I think that we can say Wednesday @ 10am is good. Are you planning on checking in the change in a public repo? Or are you going to build from a private copy of NSS and only release the code with the update?
A heads-up to the disto security list should probably happen today also once we've confirmed the time.

Why are we shipping an update to ESR24 when it is out of support? They should upgrade to ESR31 for security updates (which we have already been telling people).

I'm a bit worried that, at this point, Wednesday might still be early. A lot of NSS based projects could be potentially affected, and the patch reveals an issue that is likely present in other crypto libraries as well. It would be better to have a solid heads-up to affected projects and other crypto library maintainers first.
I'll be asking CERT to help contact as many as possible. To allow some flexibility, I will tell CERT that updates may be available "as early as mid this week" and that they should try to contact affected parties asap.
Do any of you have a relatively good list of parties/projects that are potentially impacted? Here's what I've got:
Red Hat, Debian, (every linux distro), Google, Oracle, ...
Similarly, other crypto libraries may have the same problem. Here's a preliminary list of libraries to contact and check with:
openssl, gcrypt, gnupg, discretix, wolfssl, axtls, ...
I'll ask CERT to do some research and contact others as well. Please reply with any additions/changes/concerns.

Because it's not out of support. We said we'd support a two-cycle overlap after releasing a new ESR, so ESR24 is supported until ESR31.2 is released. We didn't \_plan\_ another 24-based release, but "support" means "it gets a chemspill if necessary".

To second Intel's concern: Any chance of delaying public disclosure, even a week or two? I don't think I saw patches out yet in mozilla-central. Arguments for delaying include:
1. Assessing whether other non-NSS implementations are vulnerable to the same/similar bugs, and
2. giving major downstream users a bit more advance warning.
CERT will continue coordination with other crypto libraries with or without a disclosure delay.

We've already done this for the major libraries. Intel have even contacted a couple of more minor ones (discretix, wolfssl). I have a test suite on one of the other bugs if that's helpful. The only one that I haven't seen mentioned yet is CAPI, but it doesn't take more than an hour to test that. (I would - but a kernel update broke VMware for me.)

How is this helpful? Notice has been sent that something is coming, without details. Without the actual patch, what benefit do users get from more time? They can't do testing or impact analysis and we can't give details without giving the game away in this case.
On the other hand, we have two different reporters of this issue, a clear demo exploit and we're ready to go tomorrow with the update. Waiting needs a strong justification.
At this point, Chrome is still working on the assumption that we're doing an update tomorrow.

Adam,
Would you know if openssl is affected? (i saw a few previous comments about it being not affected, but they appeared vague to me, hence this direct question)

OpenSSL has too much flexibility in parsing the ASN.1 signatures (it accepts things like leading zeros in lengths, at least on trunk) but it doesn't appear to be exploitable because there's only a small amount of freedom. Nothing like NSS.
I'll give OpenSSL team the test cases when this is public so that they can tighten up, but it looks like they're fine.

We have not landed patches in public, but we're working off code that was posted to that bug. Whether it's the right code for NSS in the long term is unclear but we believe that it fixes the issue in the short term. The patches will be landed in public at 11am Wednesday.

There is a test site at <https://bad.ht.vc:666>. However, Brian remarked elsewhere that it might not work, even in unpatched versions of Firefox, because of an unrelated issue. Still, you might be able to see different errors between the patched and unpatched versions with that site.

yes, the test site in [comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1069405#c31 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA signature verification vulnerabilities due to ASN.1 parsing of DigestInfo") exhibits this bug up to Firefox 31, but doesn't connect in Firefox 32 for other unrelated issues.

That site - specifically port - seems to be unreachable. Maybe it's a firewall issue for me, not sure. Who owns this site?
This would be very useful for us to test with. We can at least verify the NSS change in ESR builds of Fx24 and Fx31, which ostensibly tells us that Fx versions >31 with latest NSS should be fixed as well.

<https://www.imperialviolet.org:4405/> is a server that requires the bug to function. However, it also requires TLS 1.2 so it will always fail in FF prior to 27. (Wikipedia says that FF 27 was the first to enable TLS 1.2 support. You may be able to enable via about:config in FF going back to 23 however.)

In order to verify this:
Using Fx32.0.2 go to <https://www.imperialviolet.org:4405/>
- You should see an error: "NSS RSA handshake bug test server. If you can see this message then you are affected."
Using Fx32.0.3 (build1) and going to the same URL
- You should see: "Secure Connection Failed. An error occurred during a connection to www.imperialviolet.org:4405. Peer's certificate has an invalid signature. (Error code: sec\_error\_bad\_signature)"
Using Fx31.1.0 ESR go to <https://www.imperialviolet.org:4405/>
- You should see an error: "NSS RSA handshake bug test server. If you can see this message then you are affected."
Using Fx31.1.1 (build1) ESR and going to the same URL
- You should see: "Secure Connection Failed. An error occurred during a connection to www.imperialviolet.org:4405. Peer's certificate has an invalid signature. (Error code: sec\_error\_bad\_signature)"
Using Fx24.8.0 ESR go to about:config and set the preference security.tls.version.max = 3, then go to <https://www.imperialviolet.org:4405/>
- You should see an error: "NSS RSA handshake bug test server. If you can see this message then you are affected."
Using Fx24.8.1 (build1) ESR and going to the same URL
- You should see: "Secure Connection Failed. An error occurred during a connection to www.imperialviolet.org:4405. Peer's certificate has an invalid signature. (Error code: sec\_error\_bad\_signature)"
This is a basic verification, but we'll do some exploratory testing around secure sites.

Even without upstream patches, some vendors can use additional time to even identify products that may be affected. This is a generic consideration, and like #1 doesn't seem to apply here. IOW, no strong justification for waiting.

CERT will wait to see what Mozilla and Google publish, and we'll either hold our publication or tone down the detail to match.

We've verified this using details from [comment 47](/show_bug.cgi?id=1069405#c47 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA signature verification vulnerabilities due to ASN.1 parsing of DigestInfo") on Win 7 x64, Win 8.1 x86, Mac OS X 10.9.4, Ubuntu 13.04 x64, on the following versions:
- 32.0.3 - BuildID=20140923175406
- ESR 31.1.1 - BuildID=20140923184509
- ESR 24.8.1 - BuildID=20140923194127
- 33 Beta 7 - BuildID=20140923222114
- 34 Aurora - BuildID=20140924004001
- 35 Nightly - BuildID=20140923165902
On older versions (32.0.2, ESR 24.8.0, ESR 31.1.0, yesterday's Aurora and Nightly) we get the "NSS RSA handshake bug test server. If you can see this message then you are affected." message, while on the new versions we get the "Secure Connection Failed" page as expected. This works fine on both clean install and after an update.
Also some smoke testing has been performed on 32.0.3, ESR 31.1.1, ESR 24.8.1 and partially so far on 33 Beta 7. Main focus was on browsing secure sites, but also verified stuff like: Web compatibility, Add-on & Plug-in compatibility, Common media format playback, Sync & Persona sign-on. There were several known issues encountered but no new ones. Detailed test results can be found at: <https://mozqa.etherpad.mozilla.org/Fx32-0-3>, <https://mozqa.etherpad.mozilla.org/ESR31-24-Testing>, and <https://mozqa.etherpad.mozilla.org/Fx33b7>.

The advisory is public: <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html>
I changed the comment in the second paragraph to match Intel's request. I did not change the reporter section as we'd already been working with Antoine on this issue and I've later noted Intel's report on its own line in the body of the advisory.
Firefox 32.0.3 is public at this point and other releases are in process.

FTR, this is because agl changed the server configuration, which now doesn't work with esr24.

#### Description

Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.16.2.1, 3.16.x before 3.16.5, and 3.17.x before 3.17.1, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0.3, Mozilla Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.1, Mozilla Thunderbird before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.2, Mozilla SeaMonkey before 2.29.1, Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.124 on Windows and OS X, and Google Chrome OS before 37.0.2062.120, does not properly parse ASN.1 values in X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof RSA signatures via a crafted certificate, aka a "signature malleability" issue.

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad](//linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad)

## Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) fails to properly verify RSA signatures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#772676

Original Release Date: 2014-09-24 | Last Revised: 2014-09-24

---

### Overview

The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library fails to properly verify RSA signatures due to incorrect ASN.1 parsing of DigestInfo. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge a RSA signature, such as a SSL certificate.

### Description

| [**CWE-295**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)**: Improper Certificate Validation**  RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. The Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 version 1.5 (PKCS#1 v1.5), which is defined in [RFC 2313](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2313.txt), specifies "the mathematical properties and format of RSA public and private keys (ASN.1-encoded in clear-text), and the basic algorithms and encoding/padding schemes for performing RSA encryption, decryption, and producing and verifying signatures" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS#1)). The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library incorrectly parses PKCS#1 v1.5 padded signatures due to the use of a vulnerable implementation of ASN.1 encoding of DigestInfo. Vulnerable implementations parse the DigestInfo field using the BER encoding, which allows multiple ways of encoding the same ASN.1 object. The parser implementation allows for bytes to skip validation, allowing an attacker to forge a signature when a RSA key with a low public exponent (e.g., three) is used.This vulnerability is a variant of the [Bleichenbacher vulnerability](http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg06063.html), where unvalidated bytes are allowed in the least significant bytes of the signature.Mozilla NSS is used by other software products including a number of Linux distributions and packages, Google Chrome, and Google Chrome OS. It is also possible that other cryptographic libraries may have similar vulnerabilities. |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Mozilla has released [patch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_Releases) for this vulnerability ([MSFA 2014-73](https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html)). Mozilla NSS is used by other software products including a number of Linux distributions and packages, Google Chrome, and Google Chrome OS. |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](https:///security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 98 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/)

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF.](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF)

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories.](https:///security-alerts/) An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a CVE# which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html)  Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html)

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible.

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](https:///security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html#JAVA)

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1354)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues is
now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services
and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide
environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue. (CVE-2014-6271)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still
allowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via
specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use
this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell
commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated
attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this
issue. (CVE-2014-7169)

A flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
input from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
forge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an
application using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)

It was discovered that the fixed-sized redir\_stack could be forced to
overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly
leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that
would not otherwise be run as code. (CVE-2014-7186)

An off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply
nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss
segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not
otherwise be executed by Bash. (CVE-2014-7187)

Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting CVE-2014-6271,
and the Mozilla project for reporting CVE-2014-1568. Upstream acknowledges
Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security Incident Response Team
as the original reporters of CVE-2014-1568. The CVE-2014-7186 and
CVE-2014-7187 issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
Security.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available. It
includes one version update.
Description:
Mozilla NSS was updated to version 3.16.5 to fix a RSA certificate forgery
issue.
MFSA 2014-73 / CVE-2014-1568: Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher
at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security
Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is
vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published
by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values
involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.
The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently
discovered and reported this issue.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-23 07:01:34 UTC  ``` via security and distros,  embargoed until 24th September (Wednesday)  Betreff: Chemspill releases for NSS bug (Firefox/Thunderbird/everything) Datum: Mon, 22 Sep 2014 11:30:08 -0700 Von: Daniel Veditz <dveditz@mozilla.com> An: security-group <security-group@mozilla.org>  We are currently planning a chemspill release of Firefox and Thunderbird to fix a critical NSS security problem. All downstream users of NSS will also need to pick up the patches when they have landed.  The patches have not yet landed. I expect those to happen overnight at the latest (tomorrow morning in Kai's CET), then build and test tomorrow, with a release on Wednesday.  The patches are currently in bug 1064636 (based on a problem reported by Antoine Delignat-Lavaud). Intel PSIRT reported the same issue independently in bug 1069405. Both research teams have produced forged certificates that work in Firefox.  The NSS team will land the patches in the nss repo and tag   3.16.2.1           for Firefox 31-ESR and below   3.16.5 (3.16.4.1?) for Firefox 32   3.17.1             for 33 and higher  We will then need to build  Firefox 32.0.3  Firefox ESR 31.1.1  Firefox ESR 24.8.1  Thunderbird 31.1.1  We will need to make these patches available to our Firefox OS partners.  1.3/1.4 should use NSS 3.16.2.1  2.0 should use NSS 3.16.5  2.1 should use NSS 3.17.1  Google will also be releasing Chrome on Wednesday.  Tor Browser Bundle will want these patches ASAP  Linux distros will need to push system-nss updates. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-23 08:49:12 UTC  ``` needs LTSS updates too. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-24 19:35:54 UTC  ``` <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html>  MFSA 2014-73 / CVE-2014-1568: Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-23 04:27:25 UTC  ``` Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.  The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently discovered and reported this issue.  Projects using NSS 3.17 should update the new 3.17.1 release.

This was in WooCommerce.  The WooCommerce PayPal logs indicated that SSL certificate validation was failing. This happened every time, over a period of 12 hours.  Theoretically this could indicate that someone was MITM-ing the connection, using this vulnerability. But that seems unlikely - there must be rather a lot of Digital Ocean servers in New York that want to connect to paypal.com. Is there any other possibility of how this update could have caused a problem?  In fact, the server had the same problem (certificate validation) connecting to stripe.com via HTTPS also, during that time.  When I rolled back the update, everything then worked again.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c9)  EJ Vincent    2014-09-28 01:09:23 UTC  ``` +1 David.  RHEL6 nss packages breaks Authorize.net / PayPal transactions. Apache service restart is required to clear the issue (or a roll back).  Users who are opted in to the automatic patching are getting a rude awakening on this one.

I am assuming WooCommerce is using nss and it fails to connect to paypal website after the nss upgrade?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c13)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 10:54:37 UTC  ``` I wonder at which point NSS is involved in your configuration. Do you run mod_nss?  The connection that are breaking, do you connect to the main domains, or to a subdomain host (e.g. "some-subdomain.paypal.com")?  Did you get any entries in server logfiles that explain about the kind of failure, that might helpus?  In order to reproduce, I need to connect myself to one of the affected servers. (I wonder if it's the server certificates that are failing, or maybe something with the server-key-exchange of the servers you're trying to connect to.)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c14)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 11:22:13 UTC  ``` Hi,  WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin, and makes its http calls via the wp_remote_post() PHP function, which ultimately uses the PHP curl module.  When an order is made via PayPal checkout, the transaction happens on the PayPal site. PayPal then call back via ordinary HTTP to the website via a configured address. The website then makes an outgoing https call to PayPal, to verify the legitimacy of the callback and the status of the transaction. In WooCommerce, this is done via wp_remote_post(), with an <https://www.paypal.com> URL as the parameter.  WooCommerce was logging all the attempts to contact www.paypal.com via https from the time that the new nss was installed as failures due to an inability to validate www.paypal.com's SSL certificate.  PayPal allows these callback events to be replayed arbitrarily. I tried a few, and they all resulted in the same failure. I then checked my yum logs, downgraded the nss-* set of packages (the only thing to have changed), replayed the callbacks, and they all worked.  For the calls to stripe.com, this works more traditionally. The user types in their credit card number on my website (over an https connection to my website - and these were working fine, of course - I wouldn't have received any orders at all if it wasn't), and then the WooCommerce Stripe module makes POST requests to www.stripe.com to use its API. These also all failed - but there is no logging for these. I assume it was for the same reason. After downgrading nss-*, I contacted customers who had placed orders and tried to pay via Stripe, and those that came back and re-tried succeeded.  Nothing else was changed. Apache was not restarted.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c15)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 11:24:36 UTC  ``` "Did you get any entries in server logfiles that explain about the kind of failure, that might help us?"

Based on your description, we might be able to reproduce the problem with a simple command like:   curl --head <https://www.paypal.com> while having the new NSS RPM packages installed, to see the failure.  I will see if I can reproduce the problem that way.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c17)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 12:29:13 UTC  ``` I cannot reproduce the error yet. I'm testing with a Centos 6.5 VM, fully updated.  # rpm -qa nss\* nspr\* curl\* libcurl\* | sort curl-7.19.7-37.el6_5.3.x86_64 libcurl-7.19.7-37.el6_5.3.x86_64 nspr-4.10.6-1.el6_5.x86_64 nss-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss_compat_ossl-0.9.6-1.el6.x86_64 nss-softokn-3.14.3-12.el6_5.x86_64 nss-softokn-freebl-3.14.3-12.el6_5.x86_64 nss-sysinit-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss-tools-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss-util-3.16.1-2.el6_5.x86_64  Maybe you are seeing a different set of server certificates from your position in the network?  I assume you aren't using authentication based on a client certificate, but are using simple unauthenticated https?  Could you please run this command on your server, and attach the log.txt to this bug? You can run it from your live system. It will simply execute a test connection to paypal, dump some connection results, and will disconnect immediately. It's fine to run it using the older NSS packages. It will tell us the certificates that your server sees when it makes a direct connection to the paypal server.  openssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.paypal.com:443 \    < /dev/null > /tmp/log.txt 2>&1   In addition, if you have a secondary test system (non-production) where you could temporarily install the latest NSS packages again, I would be interested in the output of   curl --head <https://www.paypal.com> (you should get a failure, if curl+nss is the culprit)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c18)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 12:57:31 UTC  ``` I installed php, and ran an interactive test.  I have a test.php file that contains:  <?php $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "<https://www.paypal.com/>"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 1); curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); ?>  I ran it using:   php -f test.php  I received a valid http response from the paypal server.  Either you are getting different certificates from the server (which I hope you will be able to provide), or there must be a non-obvious detail inside your interaction with the server that causes the issue.  The curl and php software used in a simple way seem to work correctly.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c19)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 13:55:57 UTC  ``` David, on Twitter, I found this statement from Stripe: <https://twitter.com/search?q=nss%20centos&src=typd>  "We've seen reports that a recent CentOS update for NSS is affecting SSL-enabled PHP libraries for processes started before the update. While the Stripe API is unaffected, PHP sites on CentOS may see errors with libraries like stripe-php. Restarting Apache fixes the issue."  Based on this message:  You might experience the issue, because you haven't stopped your processes. You should restart them.  This update consists of multiple libraries which depend on each other.  For example, if the application you're running continues to have one of the old libraries loaded, but during operation, your application dynamically loads one of the newer libraries from disk, you will have an incompatibility between the libraries, which can cause the application to malfunction.  You should stop your applications prior to the upgrade, and restart them after the upgrade is done.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c20)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 13:56:28 UTC  ``` Correct link to the Twitter message: <https://twitter.com/stripestatus/status/516026559669358592>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-29 14:08:36 UTC  ``` Some additional flaw details in Adam Langley's blog post:  <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/09/26/pkcs1.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c22)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 14:26:10 UTC  ``` Hi Kai,  It's true that I didn't restart Apache after applying the update - but that's because the update was via yum automatic updates. It was not a manually applied update.  Shouldn't scripts in the update automatically restart any relevant services that are likely to not function correctly without a restart, rather than waiting for manual intervention?  If I re-apply the update, I'd be likely to restart Apache immediately - the machine is processing live orders, and I'd rather just remain in ignorance as to the cause of the defect, rather than have downtime on a live store. I realise this doesn't help you at all, for which I am sorry.  David   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c23)  Huzaifa S.

We're left with a conundrum: an update was pushed to servers, which broke applications relying on third-party payment processors, yet Red Hat does not make it a habit to restart services, such as Apache, following an update. To be fair, that's expected.  As a result, applications remained in a broken state with very little visibility. The damage was already done, at which point customers start to take notice and wonder what's up.  Generally speaking, customers who use automatic updates don't make it a habit to review CVE changelogs or Red Hat errata (not feigning ignorance). I'd hate to recommend adding nss packages to the yum exclusion list.  Am I making any sense?  Thanks for all that you do!   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c29)  Ronald    2014-10-03 04:44:12 UTC  ``` We experienced the same situation with RHEL6 after applying the nss update with PayPal, with Virtual Merchant (now Converge, by Elavon) and with First Data.  All of these were using php/curl.  Another gateway (CyberSource) using their proprietary SOAP client was not affected. Some notes which differ from the experiences described above:  - nss install was manual after prompted by Webmin and Apache was not restarted - all transactions continued to process normally (over 12 hours) until Apache was restarted by automatic log rotation process with Apache restart.  Transactions for all three gateways failed until system reboot was performed. (Another Apache restart was not attempted, since that was the trigger for the failure.)  - regarding the sub-domain question, of our gateways, Virtual Merchant uses a www. sub-domain, First Data and PayPal use sub-domains other than www.  - other nss updates had been applied in the same manner without impact to these gateways (recently 2014-07-25, 2014-02-14, 2013-12-23, 2013-12-13)  Thought I would share our experience.

Antoine, please attach it to this bug. Thanks!
When you say "up to two arbitrary parameters," you actually mean one parameter of at most two arbitrary bytes, right?

\* The related NSS bugs mentioned in the "sigflaw.pdf" paper were fixed in [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)") and [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)") and maybe others.
\* The buggy parameters check that Antonio quoted above is present in both cryptohi/secvfy.c and softoken/pkcs11c.c.
\* The buggy check was added in [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), r=rrelyea, sr=wtc.
\* In [bug 351079 comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), [bug 351079 comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), and [bug 351079 comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), Wan-Teh suggested that the check be strengthened to only allow the parameters to be the two-byte sequence { 0x05, 0x00 }, and maybe also allow empty. According to him, Microsoft's implementation allows/allowed both values, but { 0x05, 0x00 } is what is required by the PKCS#1.5 specification.
\* The issue of the parameter validation being too weak is discussed extensively in [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"). We should consider this flaw to be well-known and likely to be exploited.

I'd suggest that, rather than parsing, the expected message is constructed and then compared (in constant-time) against the result for the decryption operation. The ASN.1 prefixed are constant for a given hash function (see [https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/crypto/rsa/rsa.c#292](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/%2B/master/crypto/rsa/rsa.c#292) for them).

I agree. I am currently doing some testing of the QuickDER DER parser, because I think I've found multiple issues within QuickDER that could potentially be exploited to similar effect. I will file separate bugs about those things, but for now, I recommend not relying on QuickDER for this.

I am going to make this bug specifically about being too permissive about the parameter value. I will clone this bug for the QuickDER issues.Summary: RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parsing → RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: I'm assuming Antoine is correct when he says he has a working exploit for this. There is no way to patch this bug without making it obvious what the security problem is. That means as soon as the patch lands anywhere, it becomes zero-day-ish. I imagine that if this is exploitable, Chrome will be landing a fix for it pretty soon.
Adding NEEDINFO so that it is clear we're interested in getting Antoine's PoC for this when he has it ready.

For my current PoC I cheated by using the private key of my own CA on the malformed PKCS#1 block to demonstrate the buggy behavior, but considering the nice freedom enabled by [Bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data") for the length encoding (which is one of the annoying parts), I'll try to see if I can forge a real trusted malicious CA tomorrow. The paper I cited before explains precisely how to do it, but it's still a nice little crypto exercise. If you need a CA with public exponent 3 to give it a try you can search for "WeakIntermediateRSAExponent" on <https://ca.ht.vc>

Tracking for all channels including release. We are currently spinning a 32 chemspill. It would have been nice to have this fixed so that it could be included in 32.0.1. However, if we need to chemspill again, so be it.

I don't think we need to chemspill for a non-public critical issue. This isn't a zero day. We should check a fix into everywhere late in the cycle (before last beta or two), like we often do.
I assume we need this on ESR31.

Note: I believe there 2 bytes were intentionally allowed because some software encoded a 2 byte '0' parameter instead of a NULL parameter. 2 bytes should not be enough to allow blechinbaucher. (the sited test was added specifically to prevent such an attach).

Also note, blechinbaucher is only usable against rsa keys with an exponent of 3. I think we've flushed these from the public internet. If there is an exploit (which I doubt), it's still not a chemspill since it would only affect private CA systems with poorly constructed certs.

I wasn't able to forge a 2048 bit signature yet, but I was somewhat successful with 1024 bit.
I have a test server running on <https://bad.ht.vc:666> with the malicious CA certificate. Some notes:
- there's something PKIX doesn't like in this chain. I think it's a syntactic issue, if Brian can tell me what it is exactly I should be able to get it accepted on FF32. For now, I'm turning off security.use\_mozillapkix\_verification.
- There aren't that many 1024 bit CAs with e=3 that are still accepted. I picked a Starfield CA which I think got removed in FF32 (that proves the effort to get rid of old CAs is indeed very useful).

mozilla::pkix doesn't like the fact that the root CA certificate is missing basicConstraints.cA == true. It is probably being too strict there and we should probably change that.

In [bug 1054659](/show_bug.cgi?id=1054659 "NEW"), you mentioned that you also have a PoC for e=65537; is that correct?
Anyway, the test case is actually exploiting [bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), not this bug (1064636). Still, it is much (!!!) appreciated!

Antoine mentioned that he had a PoC that affects this bug, so if I understand his claim correctly, he was able to do it in two bytes (in fact, one byte, since the length byte has to be zero, I think).

Antoine said he had a PoC for e=65337 in the other bug.
I think we've flushed these from the public internet.

See <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/03/16/rsae.html>: "Three should be fine, 2^16+1 saved some buggy software a couple of times and any larger is probably a mistake." In any case, the Mozilla packaged app system has a public key with e=3, and who knows how many sub-CA certificate and/or end-entity certificates have e=3 public keys?
Regardless of all that, and hopefully stating the obvious, we accept signatures with keys where e=3 so our implementation must be secure when e=3.

With BoringSSL (which will be in Chrome for Android with Chrome 38 and Chrome on OS X with Chrome 39) I ripped out the ASN.1 parser in RSA signature verification and am matching exactly against the expected bytes. There are no reports of problems in the beta channel so far, at least.
Nearly a decade later this has become a very tiresome bug. I'm happy to spend a little of the breakage budget to ensure that we don't have to process ASN.1 in RSA verification.

That would work, but it requires hacking your RSA parser every time you add a new hash algorithm, though it does seem to indicate that our phantom empty versus null parameter issue may be fixed. Does the BoringSSL code process any other kinds of signatures than just certs and SSL client auth? I'm thinking S/MIME in particular.

That's probably true, but I think that's what PKCS#1 entails. (Alternatively you could thing of the ASN.1 prefix as the "hash identifier" and pass it into the RSA functions as an opaque lump of bytes. That might be a nicer design, but in practice I imagine that the APIs are pretty much nailed down and thus that's not possible.)

Now that it's not the weekend I've remembered that we don't use that path in BoringSSL for certificate validation in Chrome on Android (we use the system certificate libraries so that the system-wide Android certificate UI applies to Chrome). Thus it's evidence that ServerKeyExchange signatures are safe to process strictly, but doesn't speak for certificates. For certificates, Go uses the same design and we've never received a report of a problem, but Go's usage is much more limited than a browser. None the less, I'm still very keen on solving this strictly. Anything less appears to be an invitation for more such problems in the future.
I've no evidence about S/MIME.

As Adam said, [bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data") and [bug 1064636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") should be considered two instances of the same bug, which is that a generale purpose ASN.1 parser is used with the template seq{seq{alg oid; params ANY;}; sig OSTR;}
The exploit for this bug that I considered doing (against the ANY params) was to use a zero-padded INT value, because for some reason the DER decoder will treat has having length 1. This is an existential forgery attack in the crypto sense, but to exploit, it requires a lot of cert hashes (but not a preimage!).
On the other hand, [bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data") is much nicer to exploit because it allows arbitrary byte injection instead of only zeros, and a 1024 bit CA can be produced with almost no effort as shown above. I think a very simple combination of 1064670 and 1064636 can be used to forge a 2048 bit CA at very little cost (no more than 2^40 cubings, but possibly less). If I feel like it, I may try to make one, as it allows for some nicer things (such as Extended Validation impersonation on the GoDaddy root). Or someone else can try it as an exercise.
Regardless, what matters is that you should avoid relying on the perfect DER adherence of your ASN.1 parser in particular if the template contains an ANY field. Thus, I urge you to follow Adam's suggestion of using static concatenation for signature blocks, even though you may need to consider 3 possible cases for the parameters field.

Actually, NSS decodes the PKCS #1 value to determine what hash algorithm to use. There is an API to pass a value in. If no value is passed, NSS uses the hash value pulled from the signature. If a hash value is passed, it verifies that the hashes match, so we are unlikely to be able to blindly use the trick of not decoding the value.

To make sure I understand what you are saying... It's the matching of the any field in the template for the parameter, not really the fact we are using a DER decoder. I'm fine with checking that field specifically. I don't think we can just handle hard-coded bytes for the pkcs #1 code without making a real hash of things (and making it harder to support in the future).
The critical thing for me is that we can handle parsing the hash oid without rewriting the code when we need to add, say SHA-3.
Clearly we do have to completely tighten up what the parameters look like, and only accept the minimum possible to maintain compatibility.

Given the constraints that you outline I think the following might be reasonable:
1) Parse the ASN.1 with anything, including the current code, to get the hash function used.
2) Reserialise the expected ASN.1 (not necessarily using a full ASN.1 stack - once you have the DER serialisation of the OID, the rest is very simple). Perhaps serialise two or three versions if you think that we need to cope with buggy signatures.
3) Compare the data against the serialised versions exactly.
Thankfully, since this is signature validation, constant-time considerations don't come into play.

Last night, I spent some time working on a patch for this issue, and I also discovered that (mis-)feature in secvfy.c. It seems the PKCS#1 specification also mandates that behavior when you don't pass in a mechanism that identifies the hash algorithm?
In any case, I intend to post a patch that fixes the issue for the case where the caller did supply the hash algorithm, because that is what the certificate verification and ServerKeyExchange processing code does. On top of that, we can build a patch that handles the unknown-hash-algorithm case.

The way I am doing things requires the addition of 5 lines of code for each new algorithm, in one function:
static const PKCS1DigestInfoInfo SHA1\_PREFIX = {
SHA1\_LENGTH, 15, { 0x30, 0x21, 0x30, 0x09, 0x06, 0x05, 0x2b, 0x0e,
0x03, 0x02, 0x1a, 0x05, 0x00, 0x04, 0x14 }
};
[...]
case SEC\_OID\_SHA1: dii = &SHA1\_PREFIX; break;
I think this is a reasonable cost. Also, I don't think we should worry two much about future SHA-3 support now, given that this is quite a serious issue affecting us in the present.

In the case of Firefox and Chrome, it seems like it will be difficult to get a good sense of the compatibility impact within the timeframe in which those two products should fix this bug. A conservative approach, in terms of compatibility risk, would be to allow the parameter field to be either exactly { 0x05, 0x00 } or empty, and then tighten that up later. Does anybody see that being problematic?

Once you do #1 to get the SECOidTag, the function can simply call itself recursively with that SECOidTag, which avoids needing to reserialize anything while still doing the bytewise comparison.
In contrast to the BoringSSL code, in order to support the "no parameters" and "NULL parameters" cases, you need to maintain two prefixes for each algorithm, and check for both, instead of just one. This isn't a significant complication, though.

Actually, one does not need to use the ASN.1 decoder at all, with the current set of supported digest algorithms, because the encoded length byte [the second byte in the prefix] is a unique selector.

In Firefox 33 and later, mozilla::pkix accepts a short whitelist of algorithm identifiers OIDs for the signatureAlgorithms field of certificates and for the similar field for OCSP responses. (mozilla::pkix doesn't even bother with CRLs at all.) Because this version hasn't hit the release channel yet, the compatibility impact of Firefox 33's short whitelist will have.
In contrast, NSS's certificate verification logic accepts a much wider set of OIDs in these fields, including in particular OIDS that identify only public key algorithms without identifying the digest algorithm. In those cases, NSS's CERT\_VerifySignedDataWithPublicKey function (which is what is used to verify the signatures of certificates and OCSP responses in NSS) will trust the algorithm of the DigestInfo within the PKCS#1 signature.
I recommend that people closely study the current code for the CERT\_VerifySignedDataWithPublicKey, NSS\_GetAlgorithmPolicy and VFY\_VerifyDataWithAlgorithmID (called by CERT\_VerifySignedDataWithPublicKey), and sec\_DecodeSigAlg (called by VFY\_VerifyDataWithAlgorithmID), as all of that code affects non-mozilla::pkix certificate/OCSP/CRL signature verification. In particular, things that rely on NSS's built-in certificate stuff will be dependent on the SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN logic mentioned in comments 21 through [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") above. I have written a patch (that I still need to test) that tries to minimize the risk there.
You can see the short whitelist of AlgorithmIdentifier values that Firefox 33's mozilla::pkix accepts at:
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/pkix/include/pkix/pkixtypes.h?rev=a4a8b3b58191#42>. Also note that mozilla::pkix requires that the parameters field of the signatureAlgorithm field be exactly { 0x05, 00 } or empty, whereas sec\_DecodeSigAlg does do quite a bit of parsing of other values of that field.
I recommend that people start evaluating the compatibility impact of adopting Firefox 33's mozilla::pkix's stricter approach by compiling statistics on the counts of the distinct values of signatureAlgorithm in certificates (e.g. using the various CT databases). If that shorter whitelist works, then NSS's certificate verification logic can (eventually) be changed to avoid the SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN nastiness too.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8490266&action=edit)

I hacked together a code generator for the prefixes to make sure there would be no typos, based on the mozilla::pkix code generator for OIDs. You can run it like so:
$ python DottedOIDToCode.py --dii foo bar
(The "foo" and "bar" arguments are ignored; I just didn't feel like modifying the script's argument parsing.)
Note that I reformatted the code and removed the "tag" field after I generated it.

Here's the breakdown of the signature algorithm from the certificates in the CT log.
The first column is the hex encoded, DER of the signature algorithm. The second is what OpenSSL calls it (this is not unique - several DER strings may map to the same name) and the last column is the count.
There was no filtering for unexpired certificates, although I can do that if needed.

Attached patch

[Part 1: Implement new PKCS#1 padding checking logic](attachment.cgi?id=8490281&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8490281&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8490281)

Note: I have not yet tested the unsafeAllowMissingParameters==true case, and in general I haven't tested this a lot. I'm posting it before I've written all the tests to expedite the feedback process.
This code lives in libnssutil3 instead of libnss3 because it needs to be shared by the VFY\_\* functions and softoken's PKCS#1 mechanism implementation.

Attached patch

[Part 2: Change NSS's VFY\_\* functions to use the new PKCS#1 padding checking logic](attachment.cgi?id=8490283&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8490283&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8490283)

This modifies the VFY\_\* functions to use the new padding checking logic.
Note in particular that when the caller supplies the digest algorithm (which is always the case for the verification of ServerKeyExchange signatures, and is usually the case for certificate signatures), we don't invoke SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo (the DER decoder for the DigestInfo) at all. Originally, I was planning to replace the use of SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo with much simpler logic like I mentioned in earlier comments. I've already written that logic, but in the interests of reducing the scope of the change to the minimum necssary, I decided not to do that. Also, a better strategy for dealing with that problem is to stop calling the VFY\_\* functions with SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN as the digest algorithm.

Attached patch

[Part 3: Change softoken to use the new PKCS#1 padding verification logic](attachment.cgi?id=8490288&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8490288&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8490288)

Note that this patch is completely untested, AFAICT.
Note that certificate verification and ServerKeyExchange verification do not use this logic; instead, they use the VFY\_\* functions that were patched in part 2. So, for web browsers, part 3 is less critical than part 2.
It seems to be the case that all certificate-related signature verification goes through the function CERT\_VerifySignedDataWithPublicKey, which calls VFY\_VerifyDataWithAlgorithmID, which is affected by part 2. It seems all PKCS#1 ServerKeyExchange signature verification goes through ssl3\_VerifySignedHashes, which uses VFY\_VerifyDigestDirect. (Incidentally, the logic in ssl3\_VerifySignedHashes is not as clear as I would like; I've also written some patches to clean it up, which I will attach to another bug. Those patches don't have any bearing on these security issues though.)

I see that recently NSS integrated GTest so that we can write GTests within NSS's test suite. I will adapt my tests to work with NSS's test suite and post them as well.

I agree that referencing it as |buffer| is worse, but then it would be inconsistent with the rest of the code, and also there is this comment in the code:
/\*
\* This buffer holds either the digest or the full signature
\* depending on the type of the signature (key->keyType). It is
\* defined as a union to make sure it always has enough space.
\*
\* Use the "buffer" union member to reference the buffer.
\* Note: do not take the size of the "buffer" union member. Take
\* the size of the union or some other union member instead.
\*/
I am happy to change it to pkcs1DigestInfo. Let's see what Bob says.

Adam, are you concerned that the /\*XXX: unsafeAllowMissingParameters\*/ comments will reveal too much what we are fixing? Do you want me to strip them out? Note that the same comment appears in part 2 (VFY\_\*) and "unsafeAllowMissingParameters" is also the name of the parameter in part 1. I can remove the comments if people think it is too revealing to people who are watching us check stuff in, but otherwise I think the comments are helpful.

This is pretty much what I said we shouldn't do.
I'm OK with not using the decoder, but this code should work on new hash oids without us having to hack it when we add new hash algorithms. NSS is carefully constructed to minimize the places you need to change to ad new hash oids.....
So there are two choices: 1) use the quick decoder with a very tight template, or 2) use the encoder (or hand encode if you want) to construct the expected header on the fly using the hash oid. (you may have to add hash\_len to your verify function).

Not only does it have this feature, much of the code and parts of mozilla depend on it. I actually pointed this out in my comments above. That's one reason you can't just compare the blobs.

I'm OK with this as long as the serialized versions are generated dynamically (that is the function doesn't have explicit knowledge of the various hash algorithms built in).

It seems to me a better semantic is to always parst the DigestInfo and if givenDigestAlg isn't SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN and doesn't match we should fail immediately.

In this case, we know we are dealing with and RSA signature (PKCS1 is only RSA), so referencing the RSA specific value is probably correct, independent of the rest of the code. (e.i. you don't have to make a global change to the file's use of buffer). Note below we are using the pkcs1DigestInfoLen field, not some generic length, so using pkcs1DigestInfo would be consistent.

This function isn't as clear cut. The function is key independent (though the code block is key dependent). I could go either way on this one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Bob. Thanks for the quick review turnaround time!
(In reply to Robert Relyea from [comment #40](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c40 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing"))

NSS requires several files to be changed to add a new hash algorithm. See this bug, which added SHA-224 support, and in particular notice how many files had to be changed and how many patches (not just in that bug, but in other bugs) were required:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=356713#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=356713#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - SHA224 hash / hmac algorithm not supported").
You are right that so far in NSS, the OID bytes are only encoded in secoid.c. But, it seems like maintaining that as an invariant is optimizing for the wrong thing. This issue is exploitable precisely because the DER decoder has a serious bug in it ([bug 1064670](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064670 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASN.1 DER decoding of lengths is too permissive, allowing undetected smuggling of arbitrary data"), and previously [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)") and [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)")); I think it clear by now that using the DER decoder for this is not prudent.

This would be more complicated and more error-prone, especially given the previously-stated requirement that we have to encoded the DigestInfo in two different ways, to account for implementations that omit the NULL parameter. Also, note that the data that this patch is based on \*is\* the result of a DER encoder.
I respectfully maintain that the way I've coded this is better than the alternatives suggested insofar in that it is an incredibly safe and low-risk approach. I think it would be a mistake to change to a different approach. And, I definitely don't think the code I've written is so terrible that it deserves to be rewritten, especially considering the circumstances. In particular, this is a time-sensitive matter for a huge vulnerability in many, many products. Mozilla and Google and Red Hat are going to need to invest a substantial amount of effort doing compatibility testing in the next few days/weeks as the fix for this bug gets rushed out. The more the fixing of this bug is delayed, the more risk it adds to all your products.
This bug was reported over a a week ago, and we've had the forged certificate PoC for almost a week already. I think that, even if my approach is not perfect in terms of future potential maintenance, it is good to at least fix it in this simple, clearly-correct way, low-risk manner, and \*already-written\* manner while we debate cleaner approaches to improve future maintainability for SHA-3 and other things in parallel.
So, I respectively request that you reconsider your review. Thanks!

Nope, it's a basic requirement. I'm the one who has to deal with the fall out. I've been working to reduce the number of places we have to touch... not increase them. A patch that doesn't meet that requirement is a no go into NSS. period.

You can still tighten the code up by doing what I suggest in option 2. It is not complicated, I'm even ok if you want to code it by hand (it's not difficult DER). The code should be simple enough to easily verify that it's correct, and you'll know it's wrong instantly. The multiple hardcoded values are a total hack, and not maintainable in the future.
I'm fine with the rest of the patch, please do not cut corners on this last piece.

This patch adds some additional comments about why we don't check the encoded DigestInfo against the given digest OID at the time we recover the DigestInfo from the signature. Basically, it would be redundant and misleading to do that check in recoverPKCS1DigestInfo. I split this into a separate patch in case it is decided that the comments are too helpful for people trying to reverse-engineer the vulnerability from the patches. Part 4 can be checked in separately at a later date, if so desired.
As I mentioned in my previous comment, I don't have much more time to work on this, so I'm going to hand it off to others to finish.

Thanks for jumping on this Brian, Kai says he'll look at finishing it up, since it's not a whole lot of work. I should hold back since wtc is out until at least Friday, possibly even Monday, so we'll still need an NSS reviewer on this.

Fixes in NSS, especially when introducing a new API as expected with this patch, require a new full NSS release. Afterwards, Mozilla needs to pick up the new NSS release.
Should we consider to release a NSS 3.17.1 update, with this bugfix only, based on NSS 3.17 - and renumber current NSS development trunk to 3.17.2 ?

(unrelated to fixing this bug, but related to getting this landed into stable branches, another heads up:
In order to land this into the 24.x and 31.x branches, because they still use NSS 3.16.2, which doesn't yet remove the 1024-bit legacy roots, and because of the thinking to keep the set of root CA certs frozen on the 24/31 branches for now:
It will require that we'll have to produce a special release tag of 3.17.1 that still uses the root CA list from 3.16.2.
That special release tag could be created on a NSS mini branch and named NSS\_3\_17\_1\_WITH\_CKBI\_1\_98\_RTM.)

I strongly suspect that Apple implementation is completely vulnerable to this bug.
I had a quick look over their code and after jumping around I reached the conclusion that the function that checks certificate signatures is "SecCertificateIsSignedBy" in sec/Security/SecCertificate.c
This function starts with the following lines:
SecAsn1AlgId algId;
algId.algorithm.Length = certificate->\_tbsSigAlg.oid.length;
algId.algorithm.Data = certificate->\_tbsSigAlg.oid.data;
algId.parameters.Length = certificate->\_tbsSigAlg.params.length;
algId.parameters.Data = certificate->\_tbsSigAlg.params.data;
This seems to indicate that the parameters inside the PKCS#1 block are taken directly from the "to be signed" part of the certificate which is 100% under attacker control.
I have yet to check that this hunch is correct but considering that Apple takes ages to fix these things it may be a good idea to wait a bit more before rolling this update.

Ok, it's referring to the length of the following digest (e.g. 16 for md5).

OK, I took a closer look at SecKey.c and in fact, the DEREncodeDigestInfoPrefix function uses hard-coded NULL parameters (0500). There is still a bug that causes MD5 signatures to be accepted (by using the md5 oid instead of md5withRSA) but no signature forgery.

Bob:
In order to dynamically encode the prefix, we must dynamically look up the size (in bytes) of the hash, starting with SECOidTag digestAlg.
I think we shouldn't use the size that we can see in the signature we're trying to verify, right?
I searched NSS for tables that would allow me to perform the lookup. I found HASH\_GetHashTypeByOidTag() and HASH\_GetHashObject(), which contains the size. Unfortunately, they are within libnss3, and cannot be accessed from libnssutil3.
I also found something in libfreebl/rawhash.c but I think we cannot access libfreebl from nssutil either.
Unless you can point me to another place that's accessible from nssutil, we must add a mapping from hash type to hash size to nssutil.

The hash that's passed in is not the hash from the signature, but the hash calculated by the caller over the data we just calculated. It should be correct because it comes from the underlying hash implementation.
If we aren't happy with that, then we need to have the caller pass the hash size in. There are implementations of the hasht interface in both softoken and in nss proper (one points to freebl, the other points to PK11wrap).
We could also just require the caller to check the length if we want. We should not be depending on the length inside the signature block, since that is something the attacker can fake. This code doesn't depend on that block because we don't actually decode it anywhere in the code. Instead the code takes the full der encoded signature and compares it to a hand created der encoded signature.

[part 1 - [v5] - with debug code](attachment.cgi?id=8491708&action=diff) (obsolete)

This one passes the "cert" part of our suite.
It contains some debug code, which I used to dump the encoded bytes.
I did a bytewise comparison of about half of the structs that bsmith had in his patch, and they matched.
I'll attach a clearner patch for review next...

I've generated a number of test cases around this (attached) and tried it against OpenSSL and GnuTLS. Both accept the case where the NULL is missing but are otherwise ok.

Adam, it seems like you already have a convenient way of generating certificates with malformed DigestInfos. It would be great if you could share it so that I can add some more test cases.
Here is the test I made for OpenSSL. On the OpenSSL trunk, there is a patch to ignore leading zeros in the length field of TLV constructs. Also, OpenSSL trunk does accept the indefinite length encoding of lengths. Finally, OpenSSL trunk accepts the high tag number form even for low-numbered tags. Note that I only tested the OpenSSL trunk, not any previous releases, and not LibreSSL or BoringSSL.

Brian: I'm tweaking the Go crypto/rsa library and using the attached script to generate certificates. I'll try adding high-valued tags and indefinite lengths as a test case. I think that bernull.crt tests leading zeros already (at least in the params) but I didn't test with OpenSSL trunk.

I checked the source and they only accept NULL parameters and do not use any DER decoding (they use memcmp with hard-coded ASN.1)
Only thing dodgy is that they accept MD5 signatures but it's not clear whether it's a bug or a feature.

OpenSSL and GnuTLS both accept indefinite lengths or high valued tags. But in neither case do they have an overflow that allows lots of arbitrary data. Additionally, OpenSSL trunk accepts leading zeros on the length.
These are all things that should be fixed, but I don't see an exploit given that flexibility alone.
Updated test cases attached.

Inconsistent spacing here makes it difficult to read

You make no check on innerSeqLen being <= 127.
The only reason this is safe is because of the transitive properties of lines 59 (which checks outerSeqLen) and line 50 (which constructs outerSeqLen from innerSeqLen), and that hashOid->oid.len should be less than a boundary value (if it was untrusted data, one could cause mischief).
This is at least 'surprising', and might benefit from an unnecessary, but self-documenting, check on line 59 to also check innerSeqLen doesn't have the high-bit set (therefore making it suitable for direct length encoding here)

Are we sure we want to hardcode this in a public API?
I can see no reason to expose this via the header, and doing so makes it difficult to add new digest info support in future versions if the value expands (e.g. NSS 4 might expect this structure to be 23 bytes, but the caller compiled with the headers from NSS 3 and only got 19 bytes)
Since this is not used/needed as any part of the public API, I see no reason to expose it as such.

Why this change from using SECKEY\_PublicKeyStrength (which was forward compatible in source and binary) to using a hardcoded value - especially one that may be less than the strength of the given key.

If one were to change the code to allocate a buffer of SECKEY\_PublicKeyStrength bytes, instead of using the statically-allocated buffer, that would be fine by me. The main advantage of that change is that nearly all malicious inputs would be caught by verifyPKCS1DigestInfo, instead of only a subset of them.
As far as we understand the possible attacks, nearly all of them require a DigestInfo structure that is larger than the largest one we accept, so PK11\_VerifyRecover returning a "output buffer too small" error is actually what rejects basically all previously-working malicious inputs in this version of the patch.
However, dynamically allocating a buffer and then properly managing that buffer seemed more error-prone and unnecessarily complicated to me, so I did it this way.
Note that mixing and matching different versions of libnss and libnssutil is not supported anyway. And, also, even if you compile against one version of libnssutil and then link against a different version of libnssutil, you will still be safe (assuming PK11\_VerifyRecover does its bounds-checking correctly); it's just that you may too strictly reject some valid signatures for new hash algorithms that have outputs that are either larger than SHA-512 and/or that have very long OIDs. But, mixing and matching libnssutil and libnss is likely to give you much more severe problems than that anyway.

Alternatively, it's one less place to be 'surprised' when you add a new algorithm (which is why I was surprised Bob R+'d this, given his earlier objections)

Are you sure about that? I'd be surprised to hear this from Red Hat, given the FIPS-lications of this.

Historically, that assumption - both for softoken AND for general tokens - has been wrong. softoken not doing proper bounds checking has been a particular source of Web Crypto bugs when implementing, so I no longer feel confident making this assumption.

Correct, that's the concern, and it's an echo of Bob's remarks in [comment #45](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c45 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") that greatly surprised me. This is just a hardcoded constant by another name.

It looks like the reason (as in motivation) was to find a fix with minimal effort, allowing to use the value in softoken and cryptohi, without calculating them again.

You raise a valid point, thanks for bringing this up.
I agree it would be good to do it differently.
The value depends on the maximum length of the assigned OID for allowed hash algorithms.
In pkcs1sig.c, the code wants to check the maximum reasonable length.
We could use dynamic code that looks at the length of all Oids of all allowed hash algorithms, and figure out the maximum?
What should be done in pkcs11c.c and secvfy.c?
We need compile time constants.
If I understand correctly, we simply require safe maximum sizes for buffers, not necessarily being the exact maximums?
What should we use? Should we figure out the maximum possible length for an Oid, and calculate a maximum possible encoding?
But this would involve HASH\_LENGTH\_MAX, which also seems to be hard coded to the largest currently supported hash (currently SHA512).
Are we at risk that other code in NSS might be using buffers designed for that size, and have issues like you described, when mixing future portions of NSS?

That's good, thanks for reviewing, and this was the priority.
I tried to minimize the number of changes after Brian's work...
Also I personally don't worry to much about consistency and think the patch is readable as is, but I'll try to address your comments.

For the sake of simplicity, I'll remove size\_t (FYI there are other files in NSS that don't explicitly include stddef.h either), e.g. lib/util/secload.c

Is this really a problem? It's a static function, local to the file only.

It was necessary, because I added a local variable to the scope. But since you don't seem to like it, I moved the variable to the global function scope and removed the block brackets.

Attached patch

[part 1 - [v7]](attachment.cgi?id=8493339&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8493339)

This addresses most of Ryan's small requests for naming of types and variables and consistency.
The only code change from v6 is: Added the length check for innerSeqLen, which is kind of redundant, because innerSeqLen < outerSeqLen, and outerSeqLen was already checked for being within limits.

I think that is a fair concern. I agree with you that the person assigned to this bug should change that part of the patch.

I agree that none of the patches in this bug in their current form seem to meet Bob's goal for this reason.

Ryan, this patch attempts to address the issues from [comment 77](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c77 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing").
(I suggest to click "diff" on this patch, then diff it against "part 1 - [v7]")
Does this look OK to you?
Do you have better ideas than using an arbitrary "99" for the maximum possible length for an encoded Oid?
Should we go much higher, or can we derive the maximum?

Ryan:
I will work on dynamically allocating. One issue, however, is the patch "part 3", which contains a buffer for obtaining the digest, and which currently uses the constant.
It seems difficult to change this code to dynamic allocation!
Bob suggested, if we want to be safe, we can use 2048 bytes (RSA\_MAX\_MODULUS\_BITS (16384) / 8).

OK, I apologize if it's simply due to lack of sleep or ignorance, but reviewing the patch sets again still seems to suggest there's a lot of unnecessary complexity that ALSO hides a lot of corners being cut and '64K should be enough for everyone' style assumptions, which seem unnecessary.
Working from first principles, the issue here is that we're decoding the entire message and trusting the outer wrapping to be well-formed. The fix, at least from this CL, is to also compare the encoding.
This 'seems' fairly simple to fix, re: RFC 3447 Section 8.2, and without any of the hardcoding complexities being demonstrated here.
I don't want to distract from this bug being fixed, and I think this patchset does so (which is the most pressing issue), but I also think we should clean-up. To be clear: I don't want to delay fix for cleanup.
I understand the need to handle verification where we don't know the hash algorithm (SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN) and those when we do.
When verifying, and tag == SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN
- Allocate a buffer = public modulus size
- RSA\_CheckSignRecover <-- guaranteeing that PKCS#1 padding is wellformed (mostly)
- Decode the DisgestInfo (QuickDER - bugs and all)
- Extract the algorithm tag
When verifying, and tag != SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN (or after the above steps)
- Allocate a buffer = public modulus size
- RSA\_CheckSignRecoverRaw (this recovers the full message, padding and all)
- Construct the two canonical DigestInfos
- With NULL and (if allowing it to be ommitted) without NULL params
- Construct the FULL PKCS#1 SSA-EM (RFC 3447 9.2)
- PORT\_Memcmp
As far as where this code lives
- "Decode the DigestInfo" is part of util
- RSA\_CheckSignRecover is part of freebl
- PKCS#1 encoding/decoding is part of freebl (moved down from softoken)
- Verification happens in cryptohi (in order to handle the recovery case)
In order to support the above, the \_only\_ thing we seem to need to change/update/handle is having <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#19> JUST extract the digest (in the case of SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN)
Then, update the stupid VFY functions to use the stupid PKCS#11 functions as they're intended - namely, CKM\_RSA\_PKCS, where the input buffer is the Digest Info. This will fix VFY from doing the stupid hashing itself.
This matches precisely what RFC 3447 says, and avoids any issues with the ASN.1 decoder EXCEPT for when using the SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN for RSA keys, in which case, you're dependent on it to 'at least' get the algorithm right.

Actually, strike that. We're introducing a new public API that we'll have to support 'forever', when the existing VFY\_ functions should be able to handle it just fine.
vfy\_VerifyDigest ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#612> ) and VFY\_EndWithSignature ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#545> )are \_already\_ doing the right thing for !RSA keys, by calling PK11\_Verify.
RSA keys are \_already\_ correctly mapped to CKM\_RSA\_PKCS in PK11\_Verify ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/pk11wrap/pk11mech.c#1842> )
CKM\_RSA\_PKCS is \_already\_ correctly mapped to sftk\_RSACheckSign ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/softoken/pkcs11c.c#3023> ) which maps to RSA\_CheckSign ( <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/softoken/pkcs11c.c#2932> )
RSA\_CheckSign \_already\_ does the right thing of making sure ALL of the PKCS#11 padding is correct - AND that it's properly sized (minimum 8 octets of padding)
So the only thing that's 'missing' - which covers both cert verification and the ServerKeyExchange verification - is updating the vfy\_ functions I mentioned above to \_just\_ grab the DigestInfo for the SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN case (which bsmith@ asserts is never used for these two paths anyways, and I \_think\_ he's right)
That is, the \_extent\_ of changes nescessary SHOULD be at:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#382>
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#550>
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#597>
Explicitly:
- <http://mxr.mozilla.org/nss/source/lib/cryptohi/secvfy.c#87> - do away with rsadigest, and instead store the full signature (same as DSA or ECDSA)
- In CreateContext, if and only iff hashAlg == SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN do we decode the signature (and only if provided)
- in VFY\_EndWithSignature, we KNOW hashAlg can not = SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN (because VFY\_Update needs the hash alg), so it's not even necessary to decode the signature
- in VFY\_EndWIthSignature, for RSA, we encode as fresh DigestInfo
- matching either our NULL params or missing params, using SGN\_CreateDigestInfo (or a possibly extra structure) and SGN\_EncodeDigestInfo
- Pass this to PK11\_Verify
- Profit

The problem with this, which is minor to me, but might matter to some people, is that you end up doing the RSA calculation \*twice\* in the SEC\_OID\_UNKNOWN case.
> - Pass this to PK11\_Verify
The problem with this is similar to the problem you mentioned regarding my use of PK11\_VerifyRecover with a buffer smaller than the RSA key strength: You don't know that the PKCS#11 module implemented PKCS#1 signature verification correctly. In fact we have good evidence that many (non-PKCS#11) implementations do not implement PKCS#1 signature verification correctly. Therefore, it is actually more conservative for libnss3 to use PK11\_VerifyRecover and then do as much of the DigestInfo checking itself. My guess is that PKCS#11 tokens are probably less likely to have an output buffer overflow in the VerifyRecover than they are to get PKCS#1 wrong, based on the evidence we've gathered so far.
I've actually implemented exactly what you suggest here already, but I abandoned that work after running into the "duplicate API / duplicate code path" issue and the "we can't really trust the PKCS#11 implementation to get it right" issues. I'm happy to share one or two of those attempts, if it would be helpful.

Yes, they are. But, additionally to the two reasons I cited in my previous comment, I was also concerned that it could be the case that some PKCS#11 tokens support C\_VerifyRecover for RSA keys but might not support C\_Verify for RSA keys. It is unlikely, but because this is being rushed into release, I decided to be conservative with the compatibility risk here. (Again, I think I have some patches that do this.)

But this only applies to public keys, which we always use softoken for.
I think hypothetical malformed tokens is a poor excuse for long term API debt. Even if we accepted the argument, it is still something we can handle entirely without exposing additional API surface.

I did not know that that was guaranteed. It would be good to update the documentation for PK11\_Verify to guarantee that it will never use anything other than softoken. My understanding is that, at least in theory, NSS can be configured to prefer another token even for public key operations, or that we should account for that possibility in the future.

PK11\_Verify doesn't guarantee this, but the other functions that acquire the handle do (e.g. the SECKEY functions that setup the handles)
Either way, if your concern is that some PKCS implementation only supports part of the mechanism CKM\_RSA\_PKCS operations - something purely hypothetical and not affecting the 99.99% of users - we can still keep this entirely constrained in the vfy\_ functions, without having to export some new function from until that is high impossible to use right / useful.
Specifically, if we need to (and I suspect Bob will readily say its unnecessary), we can do several things:
1) Import the public key (since it only applies to cert verification, and we ALWAYS have the cert)
2) Do the full (raw) verify recover and compare the encoded results.
Either solution avoids the hard coding fragility, while still maintaining correctness.
For discussion, I'm going to implement this tonight, as it will be a smaller change that has greater long term maintainability and correctness.

Like I said, I wrote my patch to minimize risk w.r.t. compatibility and safety. It isn't the patch I would write if it didn't need to be deployed into production with basically no testing. The whole point of pk11wrap is to make it possible to mix and match a bunch of different PKCS#11 modules in a wide variety of configurations, and I didn't (don't) want things to fail to work correctly in some some unusual configuration.

This function isn't specific to certificates, so you can't, in general, assume that there is some certificate to import the key from.

I don't understand what you mean by this one.

Keep in mind that even for SHA-3, HASH\_LENGTH\_MAX doesn't change, and the OIDs for SHA-3 hash algorithms are the same length as the SHA-2 OIDs according to <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/csor/algorithms.html>. And, even if the constants were out of sync as far as libnss and libnssutil perceive them, there would be no security failure. The only issue would be that some hypothetical non-SHA-1, non-SHA-2, non-SHA-3 hash algorithms wouldn't be accepted, which would be detected immediately during testing.
In contrast, relying on the PKCS#11 module to do the PKCS#1 verification correctly fails whenever the PKCS#11 module doesn't do PKCS#1 verification correctly. So, the flexibility of NSS works against us in this case. I don't see how we could confidently guarantee that VFY\_\* functions will only ever use softoken for RSA verification--not just now, but also in the future, due to that flexibility. I am happy to be proven wrong, though.

I agree, but at the same time, we shouldn't use the possibility of esoteria to prevent us from writing good patches. Again, I'm not trying to r- an emergency security fix, but I think we're unnecessarily cutting corners/making assumptions, and forcing a bad API to be maintained indefinitely.
If the answer is "I can't be sure about the paths to this code", then we should answer "What are the paths to this code"

All of the VFY functions work on SECKEYPublicKey
A SECKEYPublicKey is \_always\_ stored in it's data form. This is precisely the issue we were discussing two weeks ago when Richard Barnes was dealing with ECC import ([Bug 1057161](/show_bug.cgi?id=1057161 "RESOLVED FIXED - NSS hangs with 100% CPU on invalid EC key"))
So we know, for all paths using a SECKEYPublicKey, we have the full public key AND that it's imported to NSS softoken on-demand for the operation.

VerifyRecoverRaw gives you the full PKCS#1 RSA-SSA-EM. That is, block type, padding string, etc. You can reconstruct this and compare. This guarantees, for example, that the padding is not hostile and is appropriate (e.g. 8 bytes)

So what? It's a bad public dependency that is virtually unchangable and creates source-compatibility if you compile with an old header, targeting a new API. It'd be a straight up buffer overflow, since they disagree on the size of the buffer they're writing into.
The solution, which is adding slop/padding, doesn't really strike as a clean solution.

Yes. Security fails when a security module fails to be secure. I don't see that as an inherent argument against a cleaner API.

How do you know that? SECKEYPublicKeyStr contains these members:
PK11SlotInfo \*pkcs11Slot;
CK\_OBJECT\_HANDLE pkcs11ID;
How do you know that the caller didn't already set pkcs11ID and/or pkcs11Slot to something that NSS wouldn't normally set, that isn't softoken? Keep in mind that the code might be some strange Firefox extension calling VFY\_\* directly using SECKEYPublicKey objects it constructed or obtained in some unusual (to us) way.

There is no possibility of buffer overflow in the patch I wrote, no matter how you screw up the headers and linking, AFAICT. If that was a possibility then of course I would agree with you. If there is the possibility of buffer overflow then please point out the buffer overflow.

I didn't suggest adding slop, and I don't think that is a good idea.
> Yes. Security fails when a security module fails to be secure.
Then I misunderstand your argument about the buffer passed to PK11\_VerifyRecover. Why it is good to assume that PK11\_VerifyRecover got a trivial thing wrong, but it is OK to assume that PK11\_Verify got a complicated thing correct?
> I don't see that as an inherent argument against a cleaner API.
Nobody is arguing against a cleaner API.

Because creating SECKEYPublicKey objects by hand is "not a supported API"?

PK11\_Verify for CKM\_RSA\_PKCS works on encoded digest infos (or more aptly, raw data). It's sole responsibility - which hasn't changed at all with your patch (vis-a-vis VerifyRecover) is to do the post-padding comparisons of whatever data that remains. For an RSA signature, this is either the encoded DigestInfo (byte for byte) OR the SHA1/MD5 concatenation (<TLS 1.2 SKX).
There's no "complicated" thing here. PK11\_VerifyRecover returns you the bytes, and you're left to compare them. PK11\_Verify just compares them for you.

OK. It isn't clear that one cannot construct a SECKEYPublicKey via supported APIs, that reference a token other than softoken, though.

OK, I now understand what you mean. I don't think it is great to assume, in the long term, that PK11\_Verify gets the minimum padding length check right, because of the more theoretical "it might not be softoken" problem. But, also, nobody has fixed [bug 1067214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1067214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Certificate (and other) RSA PKCS#1 signature verification doesn't enforce a minimum of 8 padding bytes") yet, which is a concrete instance of getting the padding length check wrong for PK11\_VerifyRecover, so even if it is softoken, it is wrong!
So, I agree with you that if libnss wants to guard against bad PKCS#11 modules, then it should use the VerifyRecoverRaw way you suggested above. But, doing that ultimately means you end up with something very much like pkcs1sig.c in libnssutil, because softoken and libnss both expose functions that need the same logic in that case. Like I mentioned above, I didn't switch to PK11\_Verify or PK11\_PubDecryptRaw like you suggested because I didn't want to change which PKCS#11 functionality the code depended on, in the name of minimizing compatibility risk. But, again, I think that is the best long-term approach. Note that even continuing to use PK11\_VerifyRecover, you can add a check that the length of the returned DigestInfo is at least 11 bytes shorter than SECKEY\_PublicKeyStrength(k), but you'd still be depending on the PKCS#11 module to check the padding bytes.
Speaking of which, I noticed this code in sslcon.c (the SSL 2.0 code), which looks very wrong for exactly that reason:
rv = PK11\_PubDecryptRaw(sc->SERVERKEY, kbuf, &ddLen, modulusLen, ek, ekLen);
if (rv != SECSuccess)
goto hide\_loser;
/\* Is the length of the decrypted data (ddLen) the expected value? \*/
if (modulusLen != ddLen)
goto hide\_loser;
/\* Cheaply verify that PKCS#1 was used to format the encryption block \*/
if ((kbuf[0] != 0x00) || (kbuf[1] != 0x02) || (dk[-1] != 0x00)) {
SSL\_DBG(("%d: SSL[%d]: strange encryption block",
SSL\_GETPID(), ss->fd));
PORT\_SetError(SSL\_ERROR\_BAD\_CLIENT);
goto hide\_loser;
}
Also, in case it wasn't clear, I also support removing the #defines in pkcs1sig.h. I don't think it is practically problematic if they stay (I don't think there is any buffer overflow to worry about, for example).

Ryan, would you mind helping us by rewriting the patch in the way you think is ideal?
It seems to me that would be much simpler than this discussion.
I honestly don't want to upset you, but it's complicated to follow this discussion and figure out how exactly you want this fixed, and you already seem to have a very clear understanding of how you want this done.
Given you're worried about introducing this new API, it seems you really prefer to get the cleanup done immediately, in the initial release of a fix.

See the end of [comment #93](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c93 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") Kai.
Brian: w/r/t the buffer overflow, the concern is precisely the malformed modules that you're concerned about (re: a buffer of ModulusLen size vs the 'guesstimate based on header', even if it seems academic). Considering we've found and fixed several of those in softoken for Web Crypto and OAEP, I think it's reasonable to be paraboid.
I think you're right, having played more with it, that because we want to allow bad encodings in both the high and low layers, we likely end up either with a function in util to try both, or we duplicate the logic in both places. I'm still working through the deps there.
I really don't like the manual encoding - is there a reason you explicitly avoided SGN\_EncodeDigestInfo? I'm concerned it may simply be a mozilla::pkix-ism of NIH/trust nothing, and while I understand why it is, I don't think it's good for NSS to not trust itself.
I've got two approaches to upload tomorrow - one that uses PK11\_Verify twice (when necessary), using the valid and invalid digestinfo, and one that uses VerifyRecover approach that is (largely) functionally equivalent to this, but using SGN\_EncodeDigestInfo to do the heavy lifting.

My original patch was [attachment 8490281](/attachment.cgi?id=8490281 "Part 1: Implement new PKCS#1 padding checking logic") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8490281&action=edit "Part 1: Implement new PKCS#1 padding checking logic") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8490281&action=diff "Part 1: Implement new PKCS#1 padding checking logic") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8490281), where the encoding was all done ahead of time, with a code generator that generates static const data. That wasn't due to any distrust of NSS, but rather a general distrust of executing code that is more complex than it must be, in favor of trusting static data when possible. Notice in particular that that patch was able to replace a lot of "goto" usage with clearer error handling logic, because it avoided malloc/free issues, because of its static approach. I personally think that is a very good approach, but I don't want to bikeshed about that any further. Almost any new approach is better than the current approach.

Independently of the new discussion that Ryan and Brian have started, I have continued my task from yesterday, and have reworked the patch to rid of the fixed constants that Ryan disliked.
I removed the fixed size buffer in secvfy.c and replaced it with dynamic storage.
I changed pkcs1sig.c to more clearly document on which assumptions the constants are based. Since those constants are used locally, for verifying maximum expected lengths, not for static buffers, I think it should be OK.
(If you want, we can have a follow-up where we somehow dynamically iterate through the list of digest algorithsms and figure out the length of the largest involved digest Oid, but given this would be based on a fixed list of allowed digests, this would still be a hardcoded list... Unless you can tell me a dynamic mechanism to produce the list of allowed digests.)
In pkcs11c.c function RSA\_HashCheckSign(), we need a maximum buffer size. I don't know of a way to know the correct maximum buffer here. However, this code passes the size of available space into the called RSA\_CheckSignRecover, so I assume it doesn't matter to know the exact size.
I believe I have addressed Ryan's request from [comment 74](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c74 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing"), and [comment 77](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c77 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") (from end of [comment 73](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c73 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing")).
I will attach the updated patches, for you to consider, whether they are be sufficient for the initial round of the emergency patching.
These patches in no way attempt to address the new discussion that Ryan has started in [comment 86](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c86 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing").
I'll let Bob decide if we should wait for newer patches from Ryan/Brian, based on the arguments from [comment 86](/show_bug.cgi?id=1064636#c86 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery is possible due to too-permissive SignatureAlgorithm parameter parsing") and later.

There's a lot of thrashing here, so in the interest of getting something out, I'm going to review kai's existing patch. There is a cost in that it introduces a new API. I think we can add an under-bar to that API to limit exposure. The function is relatively small, and most of the issues Ryan is worried about isn't in this final helper function (which is only public because both softoken and nss proper use it).
I'm OK if Ryan wants to create a more optimized version of the patch to update later.

for my own paranoia, I would have explictly set cx->pkcs11RSADigestInfo to NULL, but cx is allocated with Zalloc, so it's not necessary.

Right, of course I missed the obvious solution of calling it 'private'.
Bob, that gives us the flexibility to remove it, say in the next release, right?

Attached patch

[Alternative patch for discussion; reduces exposure of public APIs](attachment.cgi?id=8493992&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8493992&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064636&attachment=8493992)

The attached patch is against a pre-patched trunk, and shows an alternative approach. It simplifies the code-path for RSA signatures in the VFY\_ functions and forces the caller to be explicit about allowing degenerate signatures.
The key difference from the approach here is what Brian highlighted early on - C\_VerifyRecover vs C\_Verify as the PKCS#11 entry point.

This is much clearer than before. There is a performance penalty in the case where the caller did not pass in a hash algorithm to use. However, that case should be rare enough (in mozilla::pkix and libssl, it never happens, for example) that we shouldn't have to care about the performance implications. In fact, I consider all such code to be wrong and need fixing.

This is the same "64K is enough for anybody" issue you mentioned before, right? The PKCS#11 token (perhaps a newer version of Softoken) might have a larger RSA max modulus size and then you run into the issue again of buffer overflow of PK11\_VerifyRecover is buffer-overflowy. (BTW, [bug 921687](/show_bug.cgi?id=921687 "NEW - softoken does not properly implement CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL") is the bug that you are worried about here, right?)

It is better to avoid doing this fallback. Otherwise, you make every RSA signature verification failure twice as expensive in CPU time. Normally, the efficiency of failure is not so important, but in some unfortunate cases of PKIX path building (both libpkix and mozilla::pkix), you may end up later finding a valid path after signature verification failure, and you still want that to be efficient. For this reason, I don't think this new patch is a net improvement.
We can avoid doing this fallback after we verify that it is safe to reject signatures that don't have the parameters encoded as an explicit NULL. We should have data on this from BoringSSL soon, since it doesn't do the fallback.

Again, this ends up hurting performance in the case where signature verification fails, which could still be important for some applications, such as applications that try to use PKCS#11 directly instead of using VFY\_\* for certificate signature verification. Ultimately, it doesn't seem like a net improvement.

We are recommending to partners with 1.3 that they apply the fix from this bug. I don't see a 1.3 fix in this bug and I'm not sure if we are/can still land on this branch.
However IIUC, the patch for b2g28 should be the same as b2g30 (1.4) since they share the same NSS version - is this correct? What should be advising partners to do in terms of actually applying the fix to this issue?

Hi Paul, if it is confirmed that the patch for 1.4 can be applied to 1.3/1.3T as well, then TAM can help to ask partners to cherry-pick the patch into thier future 1.3/1.3T release(as I know, at least TCL/ZTE will have 1.3 FOTA release)

Hi,
Thanks Vance and all for the info. Just to highlight that we'd need 1.3/1.3T patches, as Vance stated, and I think also the patch for FxOS 1.1.
Not all the partners that launched FxOS 1.1 devices are planning to do an OTA to 1.3 (unfortunately). I think OEMs should have the possibility to integrate the 1.1 patch without jumping to 1.3.
Thanks!
David

I'm not sure there is a lot of value in taking just this one fix back to 1.1 - 1.1 only contains security fixes up to FF23, and as such contains a large number of security vulnerabilities and patching just one doesn't seem to me to make users any more safe. (in the order of 40 high or critical security fixes at rough guess). Even 1.3 is insecure at this point, but its a lot better than 1.1.
That said, if partners want this then maybe we could invest the effort into either updating the NSS version of 1.1 or backporting the fix (I don't know what is easier or less risky or how feasible this is.Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

Hey Vance/Paul,
Yep b2g28 (1.3 and 1.3t) were updated to nss 3.16.2 in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1020695](/show_bug.cgi?id=1020695 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Mozilla 32 to use NSS 3.16.2 (once it's ready)"). So we basically need to point partners to this commit <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g30_v1_4/rev/5f35498d4aa1> on top on latest 1.3. These should apply cleanly to 1.3 and 1.3T per ryan.
Kaie/Ryan,
Please comment if the above does not hold true.

David,
I agree to Paul's comment, given how old 1.1 is and the unknown effort/risk involved in backporting these patches. I'd highly recommend us to push partners to update to atleast 1.3 at this point.

Hi,
Just to double check, for 1.3 then partners should first apply the patch related to:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1020695](/show_bug.cgi?id=1020695 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Mozilla 32 to use NSS 3.16.2 (once it's ready)").
And after that, apply then this issue's patch. Is that right?
Then I guess we need to land this also in 1.3 (and probably in 1.3T). Please, take into account that there are still some partners running IOTs and probably taking the code from our 1.3 branch. Probably this will be safer than asking to the OEMs to apply this patch separately (as they can do it anyway if they're working on their own branch).
Thanks,
David

No, 1.3/1.3t are already on NSS 3.16.2. The patch that landed on 1.4 (<https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g30_v1_4/rev/5f35498d4aa1>) should apply cleanly without any additional patches required.

Thanks Ryan!
Then I think we need to land the patch also in 1.3 and 1.3t. Can you confirm that this is going to be landed? Is it possible to have some STR to check with a 1.3 device that the patch is been applied, and working fine?
Please, take into account that 1.3 is not dead at all, and there are several 1.3 based devices being deployed right now.
Cheers,
David

We've technically killed the branch on our side, hence you will have to cherry-pick and land this on your branches. Alternatively, I will check with release engineering if there is a way they can apply this in someway and spawn a build.

Hi Bhavana -
Since some partners ship 1.3 devices around May, they didn't get a chance to update to the NSS 3.16.2. Hence I ask these partners to update to NSS 3.16.2 by appplying [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1020695](/show_bug.cgi?id=1020695 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Mozilla 32 to use NSS 3.16.2 (once it's ready)") first, and then pick <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-b2g30_v1_4/rev/5f35498d4aa1>. However, they got the following compile errors:
gecko/netwerk/base/src/BackgroundFileSaver.cpp:7:21: fatal error: pk11pub.h: No such file or directory
gecko/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp:43:18: fatal error: sslt.h: No such file or directory
gecko/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpConnection.cpp:17:18: fatal error: sslt.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
Could you suggest is there anything I missed here?
ThanksFlags: needinfo?(bbajaj)

Hi,
I really think we should facilitate the integration of this to our OEM partners, if we want them to apply the patch. For doing this, I think it'd be important to land this in 1.3 and 1.3t branches. That will make things much easier to our partners.
What do you think?

Can we please take the B2G 1.3 backporting discussion out of the bug? It's adding a lot of noise unrelated to the actual fixing of this issue.Flags: needinfo?(bbajaj)

Thanks a lot for the effort to include them in 1.3 branches.
Do you know an easy way to verify if a user build is including this fix?

openSUSE Security Update: NSS update to avoid signature forgery
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1224-1
Rating: critical
References: #897890

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously
published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of
ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA
certificates.

These Website Terms of Use and disputes arising hereunder will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. You and We irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consent to venue in the State of Delaware and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Delaware and (ii) waive any claims of forum non conveniens with respect to such venue. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Website Terms of Use.

#### Dispute Resolution

The procedures set forth in this Article will apply to any dispute, controversy or claim, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or relating hereto ("Dispute") and will be the sole and exclusive procedures in connection with any such Dispute. You and We irrevocably waive any right to commence any action in or before any governmental authority, except as expressly provided in these Website Terms of Use, and except to the extent provided under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, YOU AND WE IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY TRIAL IN A COURT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY DISPUTE.

Except as provided below, all Disputes shall be resolved through mandatory and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, State of California before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude Us from seeking equitable remedies as set forth below.

You and We will each request that the arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement.

You acknowledge that, in the event You breach (or attempt or threaten to breach) Your obligations regarding Our intellectual property, We may be irreparably harmed and may proceed immediately to seek equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction should find that You have breached (or attempted or threatened to breach) any such obligations, You agree that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, You will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling Your performance and restraining You from any further breaches (or attempted or threatened breaches).

Please do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by any applicable laws or regulations.

#### Miscellaneous

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Website Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-73

## RSA Signature Forgery in NSS

Announced
September 24, 2014
Reporter
Antoine Delignat-Lavaud
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 32.0.3
* Firefox ESR 24.8.1
* Firefox ESR 31.1.1
* Firefox OS 2.2
* NSS 3.16.2.1
* NSS 3.16.5
* NSS 3.17.1
* SeaMonkey 2.29.1
* Thunderbird 24.8.1
* Thunderbird 31.1.2

### Description

**Antoine Delignat-Lavaud**, security researcher at Inria Paris
in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries
affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a
signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is
due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to
the forging of RSA certificates.

The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently
discovered and reported this issue.

These have been addressed in the NSS releases shipping on affected Mozilla
products:

* Firefox ESR 31.1.1, Firefox ESR 24.8.1, Thunderbird 31.1.1, and
  Thunderbird 24.8.1 have been updated to NSS 3.16.2.1.
* Firefox 32.0.3 and SeaMonkey 2.29.1 have been updated to 3.16.5.

Projects using NSS 3.17 should update the new 3.17.1 release.

## Topic

Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

A flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
input from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
forge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an
application using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security
Incident Response Team as the original reporters.

All NSS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
update, applications using NSS must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1146319#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-25 02:05:41 UTC  ``` It was found the patch applied to fix [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) was incomplete and could still allow some characters to be injected into another environment. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass some security restrictions, such as access files which he previously does not have access to etc (Standard file system permissions and selinux if enabled prevail though). There is no proof that this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code, if it does it should be very difficult to exploit and depend on the specific configuration of the service.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3037-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Yves-Alexis Perez

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1568

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS (the
Mozilla Network Security Service library, embedded in Wheezy's Icedove),
was parsing ASN.1 data used in signatures, making it vulnerable to a
signature forgery attack.

An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a valid
certification chain to a trusted CA.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 24.8.1esr-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
Icedove uses the system NSS library, handled in DSA 3033-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : nss
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1568

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS
(the Mozilla Network Security Service library) was parsing ASN.1 data
used in signatures, making it vulnerable to a signature forgery attack.

An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a
valid certification chain to a trusted CA.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.17.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.17.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2015), [My Oracle Support Note 2013117.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2013117.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# USN-2360-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 September 2014

Fraudulent security certificates could allow sensitive information to
be exposed when accessing the Internet.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and others discovered that NSS incorrectly handled

parsing ASN.1 values. An attacker could use this issue to forge RSA

certificates.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [32.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/32.0.3%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [32.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/32.0.3%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1307)

## Topic

Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

A flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
input from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
forge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an
application using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security
Incident Response Team as the original reporters.

All NSS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
update, applications using NSS must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-23 07:01:34 UTC  ``` via security and distros,  embargoed until 24th September (Wednesday)  Betreff: Chemspill releases for NSS bug (Firefox/Thunderbird/everything) Datum: Mon, 22 Sep 2014 11:30:08 -0700 Von: Daniel Veditz <dveditz@mozilla.com> An: security-group <security-group@mozilla.org>  We are currently planning a chemspill release of Firefox and Thunderbird to fix a critical NSS security problem. All downstream users of NSS will also need to pick up the patches when they have landed.  The patches have not yet landed. I expect those to happen overnight at the latest (tomorrow morning in Kai's CET), then build and test tomorrow, with a release on Wednesday.  The patches are currently in bug 1064636 (based on a problem reported by Antoine Delignat-Lavaud). Intel PSIRT reported the same issue independently in bug 1069405. Both research teams have produced forged certificates that work in Firefox.  The NSS team will land the patches in the nss repo and tag   3.16.2.1           for Firefox 31-ESR and below   3.16.5 (3.16.4.1?) for Firefox 32   3.17.1             for 33 and higher  We will then need to build  Firefox 32.0.3  Firefox ESR 31.1.1  Firefox ESR 24.8.1  Thunderbird 31.1.1  We will need to make these patches available to our Firefox OS partners.  1.3/1.4 should use NSS 3.16.2.1  2.0 should use NSS 3.16.5  2.1 should use NSS 3.17.1  Google will also be releasing Chrome on Wednesday.  Tor Browser Bundle will want these patches ASAP  Linux distros will need to push system-nss updates. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-23 08:49:12 UTC  ``` needs LTSS updates too. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=897890#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-24 19:35:54 UTC  ``` <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html>  MFSA 2014-73 / CVE-2014-1568: Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.

I understand that the off-by-one error is not exploitable (after the initial patch) and is not a security issue, but since there is a patch for this issue I would like to know if the latest patch for the off-by-one error is broken or not.  For example, when I change the double-quote used in above POC to single-quote for the for loop as below,  (for x in {1..200} ; do echo 'for x$x in ; do :'; done; for x in {1..200} ; do echo done ; done) | bash || echo "CVE-2014-7187 vulnerable, word_lineno"  ... it still reports vulnerable on a patched system executing the command.  Is it because the patch is broken or the POC is not reliable?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1146804#c13)  Florian Weimer    2014-10-07 08:16:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jayesh from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1146804#c12)) > For example, when I change the double-quote used in above POC to > single-quote for the for loop as below, >  > (for x in {1..200} ; do echo 'for x$x in ; do :'; done; for x in {1..200} ; > do echo done ; done) | bash || echo "CVE-2014-7187 vulnerable, word_lineno" >  > ... it still reports vulnerable on a patched system executing the command.  Sorry, you really can expect that shell scripts to work after you make some random changes.  With the single quotes, an invalid shell script is generated, which will fail execution with any version of bash (and many other shell implementations).  So this test is invalid (or at least, it does not test what you think it does).   ``` |  |

Package        : iceweasel
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1568

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS
(the Mozilla Network Security Service library, embedded in Wheezy's
Iceweasel package), was parsing ASN.1 data used in signatures, making it
vulnerable to a signature forgery attack.

An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a
valid certification chain to a trusted CA.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 24.8.1esr-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
Iceweasel uses the system NSS library, handled in DSA 3033-1.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# USN-2361-1: NSS vulnerability

24 September 2014

Fraudulent security certificates could allow sensitive information to
be exposed when accessing the Internet.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) - Network Security Service library

## Details

Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and others discovered that NSS incorrectly handled

parsing ASN.1 values. An attacker could use this issue to forge RSA

certificates.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [2:3.17.1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/2%3A3.17.1-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.17.1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.17.1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.17.1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.17.1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications

that use NSS, such as Evolution and Chromium, to make all the necessary

changes.
