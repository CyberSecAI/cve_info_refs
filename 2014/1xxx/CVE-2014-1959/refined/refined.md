Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the GnuTLS library incorrectly handling X.509 version 1 intermediate certificates. GnuTLS was treating these certificates as valid CA certificates by default, which deviates from the intended and documented behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is in the certificate verification logic within GnuTLS. It was not properly distinguishing between version 1 intermediate certificates and valid CA certificates.
- **Implicit Trust:** The vulnerability causes GnuTLS to implicitly trust version 1 intermediate certificates as CAs. This could lead to accepting a certificate chain that should otherwise fail verification, if an attacker could somehow insert a malicious v1 intermediate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassing Certificate Validation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass the expected certificate validation checks, which would normally provide assurance of identity.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** This could enable man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept and potentially modify communications between a client and a server.
- **Impersonation:** By presenting a certificate chain containing a malicious version 1 intermediate certificate, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Certificates:** The attack vector is through specially crafted X.509 certificate chains. An attacker would need to include a version 1 intermediate certificate, which would be incorrectly treated as a valid CA by vulnerable GnuTLS versions.
- **Network Interception:** A man-in-the-middle position is generally required to intercept a client's connection and supply a fake certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle Position:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and server.
- **Malicious Certificate Creation:** The attacker would need to be able to generate or acquire an X.509 certificate chain with a version 1 intermediate certificate.
- **Trusted CA Issuing v1 Certificates:** The attack is only feasible if the victim's trust store includes a CA which issues X.509 version 1 certificates.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects GnuTLS versions 2.11.5 and later, prior to the fix.
- The issue is addressed in GnuTLS versions 3.1.21, 3.2.11 and later, and also backported in older versions.
- Debian and Ubuntu provided updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a server sends the client a certificate chain with a v1 intermediate.
- Patches were released to correct the behavior of GnuTLS.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially bypass certificate validation by exploiting an incorrectly trusted intermediate certificate, leading to potential MitM attacks and impersonation.
