The first temporary file is created securely, but the second open(2)
call lacks the O_EXCL flag. The vulnerable code appears to be:

  # flag file is used to signal the child is ready
  $stash->{flag_files}{$which} = scalar tmpnam();

The File::temp::tmpnam documentation reads: “When called in scalar
context, returns the full name (including path) of a temporary file
(uses mktemp()). The only check is that the file does not already exist,
but there is no guarantee that that condition will continue to apply.”

There is no upstream commit to fix this issue yet.

Could a CVE be assigned for this insecure use of /tmp for the
Capture::Tiny module?

There is no upstream commit to fix this issue yet.

Could a CVE be assigned for this insecure use of /tmp for the

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1062424#c0)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-06 22:03:29 UTC  ``` It was found [1] that the Capture::Tiny module, provided by the perl-Capture-Tiny package, used the File::temp::tmpnam module to generate temporary files:  ./lib/Capture/Tiny.pm:  $stash->{flag_files}{$which} = scalar tmpnam();  This module makes use of the mktemp() function when called in the scalar context, which creates significantly more predictable temporary files. Additionally, the temporary file is created with world-writable (0666) permission. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to a program using the Capture::Tiny module.  This issue has been reported upstream [2], but has not yet been fixed.  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/267> [2] <https://github.com/dagolden/Capture-Tiny/issues/16>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1062424#c2)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-06 22:16:46 UTC  ```  Created perl-Capture-Tiny tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1062426](show_bug.cgi?id=1062426 "CLOSED ERRATA - perl-Capture-Tiny: insecure temporary file usage [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1062424#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-07 05:59:29 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned CVE-2014-1875: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/272>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1062424#c4)  Petr Pisar    2014-02-10 07:27:09 UTC  ``` Reproducer:  $ strace -fq -e open -- perl -MCapture::Tiny -e 'Capture::Tiny::tee_stdout { print qq{foo\n} }' 2>&1 | grep 'O_CREAT' | grep -v O_EXCL [pid  8578] open("/tmp/uAM1hQ9lbl", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3  There shouldn't be any open(, O_CREAT) without O_EXCL.

```
Revision history for Capture-Tiny

0.24      2014-02-06 17:15:37-05:00 America/New_York

  Fixed:

  - Closed security hole in use of semaphore flag in /tmp;
    now opens semaphore the using O_CREAT|O_EXCL

0.23      2013-10-20 11:25:34 America/New_York

  Fixed:

  - minimum Perl prereq is back to 5.6 (but $diety help you if
    you're still stuck on 5.6)

  Documented:

  - Added warning about using @_ in a capture block

0.22      2013-03-27 15:50:29 America/New_York

  Documented:

  - Issue tracker is now github

0.21      2012-11-14 19:04:49 America/New_York

  Changed:

  - Skips tee and leak tests for closed STDIN on Perl prior to
    5.12 when PERL_UNICODE=D.  Documented lack of support as
    a known issue.

  - Isolated tee subprocesses from effects of PERL_UNICODE as a
    precaution (though this did not fix the above issue).

  - Improved layer detection for handles proxied due to being closed
    or tied.

0.20      2012-09-19 13:20:57 America/New_York

  Fixed:

  - Nested merged captures that include an external program call no longer
    leak STDERR to the outer scope [rt.cpan.org #79376]

0.19      2012-08-06 20:26:34 America/New_York

  Fixed:

  - Work around rt.perl.org #114404 by forcing PerlIO layers back on
    original handles [rt.cpan.org #78819]

0.18      2012-05-04 16:31:53 America/New_York

  Added:

  - When capture or tee are called in void context, Capture::Tiny
    skips reading back from the capture handles if it can do so safely

0.17_52   2012-03-09 11:45:19 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Tied STDIN is always localized before redirections to avoid tees
    hanging on MSWin32

  - Copying and reopening STDIN is necessary to avoid tees hanging on MSWin32.

0.17_51   2012-03-07 18:22:34 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Avoids reopening STDIN while setting up a capture, which avoids
    some problems with pathological tied filehandle implementations
    such as in FCGI

  Tested:

  - Re-enabled tied STDIN testing for MSWin32 to see if changes above
    avoid crashes seen historically

0.17      2012-02-22 08:07:41 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Added a workaround for failing t/08-stdin-closed.t under blead
    perl / 5.15.8 [rt.perl.org #111070]

  Documented:

  - Clarified some limitations; added a link to CPAN Testers Matrix;
    removed redundant BUGS section; standardized terminology

  Tested:

  - Added a test using Inline::C to print to stdout and stderr in response
    to rt.cpan.org #71701

0.16      2012-02-12 21:04:24 EST5EDT

  Documented:

  - Noted problems and workaround for FCGI's pathological tied STDIN
    [rt.cpan.org #74681; thank you Karl Gaissmaier for testing the
    workaround]

0.15      2011-12-23 11:10:47 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Repeated captures from a custom filehandle would return undef instead
    of the empty string (and would warn). This has been fixed.
    [rt.cpan.org #73374 part two. Thank you to Philipp Herz for help
    in reproducing this bug.]

  Other:

  - Commented out debugging code for slightly less runtime overhead

0.14      2011-12-22 10:14:09 EST5EDT

  Added:

  - Capturing with custom filehandles will return only newly appended
    output instead of everything already in the file.
    [rt.cpan.org #73374]

0.13      2011-12-02 13:39:00 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Fixed t/18-custom-capture.t failures on Windows due to tempfile
    removal problems in the testfile

0.12      2011-12-01 16:58:05 EST5EDT

  Added:

  - New functions capture_stdout, capture_stderr, tee_stdout, tee_stderr
    [rt.cpan.org #60515]

  - Capture functions also returns the return values from the executed
    coderef [rt.cpan.org #61794, adapted from patch by Christian Walde]

  - Capture functions take optional custom filehandles for capturing
    via named files instead of anonymous ones [inspired by Christian Walde]

  Fixed:

  - Tied filehandles based on Tie::StdHandle can now use the ":utf8"
    layer; removed remaining TODO tests; adds Scalar::Util as a dependency

  Changed:

  - When Time::HiRes::usleep is available, tee operations will
    sleep during the busy-loop waiting for tee processes to be ready
    [rt.cpan.org #67858]

0.11      2011-05-19 23:34:23 America/New_York

  Fixed:

  - Tests will not use Test::Differences version 0.60 or greater

0.10      2011-02-07 07:01:44 EST5EDT

  Fixed:

  - Setting PERL_CAPTURE_TINY_TIMEOUT to 0 will disable timeouts

0.09      2011-01-27 23:52:16 EST5EDT

  Added:

  - Added support for $ENV{PERL_CAPTURE_TINY_TIMEOUT} to control
    the timeout period under 'tee'; tests set not to timeout to
    avoid false FAIL reports on overloaded virtual machine smokers

  Fixed:

  - $@ set within a captured block is no longer lost when the capture
    is completed; likewise, the initial value of $@ is not lost
    during capture (when no subsequent error occurs) (RT #65139)

0.08 Sun Jun 20 19:13:19 EDT 2010

  Fixed:

  - Exceptions in captured coderef are caught, then handles are restored
    before the exception is rethrown (RT #58208)

0.07 Sun Jan 24 00:18:45 EST 2010

  Fixed:

  - Changed test for $? preservation to be more portable

  - Dropped support for Perl 5.8.0 specifically due to excessive bugs.
    Tests will bail out. (5.6.X is still supported)

0.06 Thu May  7 06:54:53 EDT 2009

  Fixed:

    - On Win32, subprocesses now close themselves on EOF instead of being
      killed with a signal

0.05_51 Tue Apr 21 07:00:38 EDT 2009

  Added:

    - Support for wide characters on handles opened to utf8

    - Support for STDOUT, STDERR or STDIN opened to in-memory
      files (open to scalar reference) or tied, albeit with some limitations

  Testing:

    - Verify that $? is preserved during capture { system(@cmd) };

0.05 Tue Mar  3 06:56:05 EST 2009

  Fixed:

    - On Win32, increased a delay waiting for buffers to flush to avoid losing
      final output during tee()

0.04 Wed Feb 25 09:25:27 EST 2009

  Added:

    - Can capture/tee even if STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR are closed prior to
      capture/tee block

    - Generally, added more error handling

  Fixed:

    - Will timeout instead of hang if subprocesses fail to start

0.03 Fri Feb 20 13:03:08 EST 2009

  Added:

    - capture_merged() and tee_merged()

  Fixed:

    - Tests skip if not Win32 and no fork() (rather than Build.PL and
      Makefile.PL failing); this allows capture() on odd platforms, even if
      fork doesn't work

0.02 Tue Feb 17 17:24:35 EST 2009

  Fixed:

    - Bug recovering output when STDOUT is empty (reported by Vincent Pit)

    - Removed Fatal.pm to avoid global action-at-a-distance

0.01 Fri Feb 13 23:15:19 EST 2009

  Added:
    - 'capture' and 'tee' functions

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
