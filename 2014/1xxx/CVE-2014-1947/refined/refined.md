Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1947:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2014-1947 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick's PSD (Photoshop Document) image processing when writing layer names. Specifically, it occurs because the code uses a format string `"L%02ld"` to generate layer names, which could write more data than the allocated 4-byte buffer `layer_name[4]` when the number of layers exceeds 99. The `FormatLocaleString` function was used to format the layer number into a string like "L01", "L99", etc. If the layer count was 100 or more (e.g., "L100"), the resulting string would require 5 bytes (including the null terminator), exceeding the buffer's capacity and leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Insufficient Buffer Size:** The `layer_name` buffer was statically sized to 4 bytes, while the formatting could produce a string larger than 4 bytes for layer counts >= 100 in older versions using `"L%02ld"`.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:**  There is a lack of proper bounds checking before writing the formatted layer name into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to memory corruption due to the buffer overflow.
- **Potential for Code Execution:**  While the provided information doesn't explicitly confirm arbitrary code execution, memory corruption vulnerabilities often have the potential for code execution by overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack. The severity is rated as "medium", suggesting a potentially exploitable condition.
- **Application Crash:** In less severe cases, the overflow can lead to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PSD Image:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PSD image file containing a large number of layers, causing the `layer_count` to reach 100 or greater, triggering the overflow.
- **Image Processing:**  The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes this malicious PSD image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create PSD files:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify PSD files to include a large number of layers.
- **Target must process file:** The attacker needs to get a victim to process the malicious PSD image using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

-   **CVE-2014-2030:** A related vulnerability, CVE-2014-2030, was assigned to newer ImageMagick versions that used the format string `"L%06ld"` which would cause an overflow with any layer count due to the format string needing 8 characters. The fix for both of these issues was to increase the size of `layer_name`.
-   **GraphicsMagick:**  The bug also affected GraphicsMagick, and it was tracked and fixed in a similar fashion.
-  **RLE decoding issue:** The initial analysis in the advisory (<http://secunia.com/advisories/56844/>) was related to RLE decoding and a separate CVE-2014-1958. However, the issue related to layer names and CVE-2014-1947 was a distinct buffer overflow issue
-  **Fortify source protection:** In GraphicsMagick, the overflow was caught by the fortify source buffer overflow protection.
