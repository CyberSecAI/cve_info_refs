{
  "CVE-2014-1552": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered where network-level redirects cause an `<iframe>` sandbox to forget its unique origin and behave as if the `allow-same-origin` keyword were applied. This allows the sandboxed content to access other content from the same origin without explicit approval.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Network-level redirects cause an `<iframe>` sandbox to lose its unique origin, due to the sandbox implementation using null principals and the redirects not propagating the owner.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The sandbox implementation did not correctly propagate the null principal owner across redirects.",
        "Failure to maintain the unique origin of a sandboxed iframe after a redirect."
      ],
      "impact": "Sandboxed content can access other content from the same origin, without explicit `allow-same-origin` permission. In cases where the `allow-scripts` keyword is present, this could lead to a complete sandbox bypass.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious web page containing a sandboxed iframe that redirects to a target URL on the same origin.",
        "A malicious email containing a sandboxed iframe that redirects to a target URL on the same origin."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the content of a webpage that a victim visits or the content of an email. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim."

        "Firefox",
