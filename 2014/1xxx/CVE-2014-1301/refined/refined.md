Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple memory corruption issues existed within WebKit, the rendering engine used by iTunes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is memory corruption, which is a broad class of vulnerabilities that can arise from various coding errors like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and double-free issues, all of which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   Unexpected application termination (crash) of iTunes.
*   Arbitrary code execution: This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the iTunes process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack while browsing the iTunes Store via the iTunes application. This implies that an attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the iTunes client and the iTunes Store servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which involves:
*   Being on the same network as the victim or having control over the network path.
*   Being able to intercept and manipulate the network traffic going to and from the iTunes application.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in iTunes 12.0.1, due to memory corruption in WebKit, can allow an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack to potentially crash the application or execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when the user browses the iTunes Store.
