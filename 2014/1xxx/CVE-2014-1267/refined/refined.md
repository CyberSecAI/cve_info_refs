- Failure to enforce profile expiration dates.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a configuration profile with an extended or unlimited expiration date which would then continue to be enforced by the device even after it should have expired.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a configuration profile to the vulnerable device.
