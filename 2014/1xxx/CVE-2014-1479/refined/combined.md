Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik LÃ¶nnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0133)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled error messages related to
web workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
policy, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird. When combined with
other vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security
implications. (CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly handled
window objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain
security checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.3.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.3.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1477 CVE-2014-1479 CVE-2014-1481 CVE-2014-1482
                 CVE-2014-1486 CVE-2014-1487 CVE-2014-1490 CVE-2014-1491

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.

This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen and Sotaro Ikeda

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Fredrik LÃ¶nnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.

([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

FabiÃ¡n Cuchietti and Ateeq ur Rehman Khan discovered that it was possible

to bypass Javascript execution restrictions when replying to or forwarding

mail messages in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to steal confidential information or modify message content.

([CVE-2013-6674](/security/CVE-2013-6674))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060940#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 01:38:15 UTC  ``` Security researcher Cody Crews reported a method to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) by using XML Binding Language (XBL) content scopes to clone protected XUL elements. This could be used to clone anonymous nodes, making trusted XUL content web accessible.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.    External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-02.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Cody Crews as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060940#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 19:57:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0133 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0133.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1060940#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 20:17:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0132.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060942#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 01:51:32 UTC  ``` Fredrik "Flonka" LÃ¶nnqvist discovered an issue with image decoding in RasterImage caused by continued use of discarded images. This could allow for the writing to unowned memory and a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the âMozilla
Application Suiteâ.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

```

All seamonkey-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-02

## Clone protected content with XBL scopes

Announced
February 4, 2014
Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 27
* Firefox ESR 24.3
* SeaMonkey 2.24
* Thunderbird 24.3

### Description

Security researcher **Cody Crews** reported a method to bypass
System Only Wrappers (SOW) by using XML Binding Language (XBL) content scopes to
clone protected XUL elements. This could be used to clone anonymous nodes,
making trusted XUL content web accessible.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0132)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error messages related to web
workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy,
which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox. When combined with other
vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security implications.
(CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly handled window
objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain security
checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 24.3.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 24.3.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060952#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 02:06:23 UTC  ``` Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported an inconsistency with the different JavaScript engines in how JavaScript native getters on window objects are handled by these engines. This inconsistency can lead to different behaviors in JavaScript code, allowing for a potential security issue with window handling by bypassing of some security checks.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.    External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-13.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Boris Zbarsky as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060952#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 19:58:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0133 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0133.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1060952#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 20:17:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0132.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

USN-2102-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced a

regression which could make Firefox crash under some circumstances. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik LÃ¶nnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=798654&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130814063812
Steps to reproduce:
I used an iframe with a data URL to load an XML file to get access to the observe function that xml pretty print bindings provide, I then used this function and some finagling to get fully anonymous content appended as a child of content that was accessible from the XML iframe. This works because the observe function shares the scope with other anonymous content that might be provided with other bindings. I believe its actually a cross-compartment wrapper bypass. The interesting part is that once the anonymous content that is inaccessible is the child of content I can access, that cloneNode(true) clones that content and makes a fully accessible clone. I cant help but reference my bug here:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=817922](/show_bug.cgi?id=817922 "RESOLVED FIXED - Functions implemented by XBL are callable, this could be a serious security threat under the right circumstances.")
which points out way back then that this would probably come to pass. Ill be CC'ing bholley on this one because i mentioned it to him some months back now, I just haven't had time at all lately to focus on security research and I'm even using my day off for labor day weekend to get this public ASAP. I've also noticed that in the newest nightly these XUL elements I'm cloning have become HTMLDivElements. I assume that change is to mitigate future problems like this, and maybe in those instances someone wouldn't even realize that they had gained access to native anonymous content. As I've said I have very little time lately, so please fill in the blanks and correct me on what I'm wrong about here. Thanks.
Actual results:
Using this technique I was able to clone an XUL element being provided as anonymous content from the pluginProblem.xml bindings.
Expected results:
The reference to the XUL element that can be obtained by using document.getAnonymousNodes/document.getAnonymousElementByAttribute should not allow itself to be appended to the content accessible from the XML iframe.

Thought I should mention also that once you see the content from pluginProblem.xml appended to the actual xmliframe data, it loses all styling provided by the chrome style sheets, and the text box for putting in comments that can be expanded in size becomes visible, if you use your mouse and attempt to enlarge it it causes a crash which I believe will turn out to be a null pointer dereference. I just did a clean install from a full format and I dont have all my sources and debug enviroment setup just yet, so I cant tell you exactly where it takes place. Ill work on seeing if that can be triggered without the mouse(meaning code generated expansion of the text box without clicks which might need to be trusted.)
If I can trigger it Ill get my dev/debug environment setup and come back to give more specific details. Btw crash occurs even in newest nightly.

Sorry if this is stupid to ask, but do you need info from me? Info on the crash? I've realized that its not actually resizing the text input box that causes the crash but just clicking in it to type does. I can fire up a dump now that I have my environment setup if you need.

The content in the testcase is an <embed> element, with the pluginProblem.xml binding applied. This content is anonymous, but not naturally native-anonymous. We make it act like NAC by setting chromeOnlyContent=true in the pluginProblem.xml binding (something smaug added about a year ago). This is mostly to prevent people from poking around at the plugin warning and performing clickjacking attacks. According to MXR, pluginProblem.xml is our only usage of chromeOnlyContent.
For the most part, SOWs are just designed to prevent pages from rearranging content in ways that the browser doesn't expect. The one place I know of that we care about read-access is with <input type="file">.
An important difference between bonafide NAC and chromeOnlyContent is that the latter is returned by document.getAnonymousNodes (with a SOW around it), whereas NAC is not. This means that the testcase in this bug, which relies on document.getAnonymousNodes, won't work for NAC like <file> and <video>. Cody, can you think of a way to make this testcase work if we can't call getAnonymousNodes on the bound element? If I switch the <embed> to <input type="file">, We currently throw in the first observe() call in finishClone().
As long as this attack only works against chromeOnlyContent, I don't think it's a security problem. If it works against NAC, then we'd consider that a security bug, though I don't know how severe. Sec-moderate maybe?

If this were true for <file>, that would indeed be a problem.

This is because pluginProblem itself switched from XUL elements to HTML elements in [bug 888510](/show_bug.cgi?id=888510 "VERIFIED FIXED - Review theming for the new plugin in-page UI"). I'm pretty sure the reasons were orthogonal.

I think anyone poking this deeply wouldn't be so easily fooled. ;-)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but during the major XBL rework that you powered through some time back all XBL code runs in a separate compartment right? When gaining access to any content provided by XBL bindings you are essentially provided with a SOW in place of that content. The main point here is that all functions accessible by content through the binding names available as windows properties can bypass SOWs to an extent and see the original content, but they are limited in the fact that the function will only do certain actions with arguments passed in, or a new |this| through binding that function elsewhere. It is the fact that these functions see the original content that allows the XUL element to be appended to the anonymous content of the iframe document in the first place, and this is what I was referring to as a cross-compartment wrapper bypass.

I noticed this problem some months back and didn't fully follow up on what all can be done because it always depends on the predefined functions provided by XBL, Ill take some time and dig deep to see if I can make it work with file, or even gain access to the video controls again(my OCD makes me want to do this anyway for some reason.) Ill start off tonight, and see what I can come up with by tomorrow evening. Is there a list of elements, and the bindings they trigger when added to a document somewhere so I could get a head start on this? If not its fine, I have a fairly good idea already I'm just probably missing a couple at least.
A quick question, I've noticed while using the DOM inspector that content appended to anonymous content appears as anonymous content afterwards, would that content then be obtainable by getAnonymousNodes/getAnonymousElementByAttribute ?

All in-content XBL, correct. Chrome XBL (and remote XUL XBL) runs same-compartment.

Not entirely. You can access anonymous content. This restriction applies only to \_native\_ anonymous content and chromeAccessOnly.

I see. I think "SOW bypass" might be a more appropriate way to refer to it, but it's all semantics.

The element-bound ones are in layout/style/html.css. Basically just video, audio, and marquee. There's also pluginProblem, and things like scale.xml (used by other stuff like video). XML pretty printers is another case that I hadn't thought of until you found it (very clever!).
As for NAC, have a look at things that implement nsIAnonymousContentCreator: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=CreateAnonymousContent>

I think so, but I'm not sure. Blake would know.

> Blake, can you confirm that my analysis here makes sense?
I think your analysis does make sense.
One thing to keep in mind here is that native anonymous content actually has two uses: for "true" \*native\* anonymous content, we've always tried to prevent content from messing with it for fear that the C++ code that created it would get confused and end up doing something exploitable.
When we implemented <audio> and <video>, we wanted to a) implement the controls in XBL and JavaScript and b) hide the implementation from the web page in order to not accidentally create a second API that web authors would use instead of the standard one. In order to accomplish that, we used regular XBL bindings and then set the "native" bit on them (this is roughly equivalent to "chrome only" bindings, I think).
In the first case, being able to change the shadow DOM would be considered an sg:crit, whereas in the second, we're less worried about exploits and more worried about polluting the web platform. It seems that, for the moment, this bug is only about the second case.

Yes. The state of being "anonymous content" is, in part, inherited from an element's parentNode. The one exception is the root of an anonymous subtree, and we don't allow those to be reparented or moved in the DOM.Flags: needinfo?(mrbkap)

So, this is what I thought, but smaug was adamant in a thread in December that this wasn't strictly accurate.

Indeed, I don't see anywhere that we actually set the bit for video controls. Is there one that I'm missing? If not, this seems to be the primary distinction here. <video> AC gets SOWs because it lives underneath a piece of bonafide NAC (which incidentally also prevents it from being returned by document.getAnonymousNodes). pluginProblem gets its SOWs from the explicit "chromeOnlyContent" attribute, which doesn't preclude accessing it from getAnonymousNodes. We could fix that, but it's not a major security issue AFAICT. Probably better to just land [bug 912322](/show_bug.cgi?id=912322 "RESOLVED FIXED - document.getAnonymous* should not be available to web content") and embargo this bug.

No, this bug is more about pluginProblem, which we can't allow content to change due to the threat of clickjacking. <video> is neither involved nor affected, since it uses NAC-inheritance instead of chromeOnlyContent. Modifying pluginProblem AC would indeed be a problem, but AFAICT the exploit here only allows it to be read/cloned.Flags: needinfo?(mrbkap)

Just a quick update, nothing worth putting here as of now, but there's some very promising things that I'm running into while digging into this. The focus has currently shifted away from file input elements for the moment but I plan to come full circle back around to that before I'm done. Some very tricky things can be achieved with the pieces I have already, now If only I could get more hours in the day.

Thought I would come back and touch on this while it was on my mind. I've been digging deep like I said, and I'm certain that I can accomplish click-jacking on content provided by pluginProblem.xml already at this momemnt. I'm still working on ways to confuse and maybe trick getAnonymousNodes/getAnonymousElementsByAttribute to allow bypassing the true NAC that prevents the subsequent anonymous children from being returned. Also I'm currently able to obtain a reference to (or even modify the original) iframe that is provided by embeds say in the case of <embed src='data:application/pdf,'/> where the embed allows to preview the plugin content. Also using functions provided by the marquee bindings its possible to call addEventListener on content protected by SOWs and then even dispatch a corresponding event to those elements to trigger the code added. That part has limitations I'm working on understanding, but I'm trying to keep this short. This all has led me down the path of being able to inject certain elements into rss feeds, and I know that since firefox prevents the inheriting of principals its probably going to be unimpressive/unproductive overall but its still interesting. My main concern and the reason I'm putting all this out there is I have the problem of time again, even when I have time to do this research I want to spend it more on getting my C++ up to a level at least close to a lot of you, so I can start actually contributing to development some too. This is all part of bigger things I'm trying to build up to putting together in the future, and I have decent C skills mainly when using command line driven apps and have never spent much time indulging in the win API to give nice GUI experiences. I sidetracked myself there, the point is that I'm gonna be putting out updated info and maybe even small test cases to show off the problems I noticed, and anytime I receive 'undefined behavior', because I'm sure someone with a more in depth knowledge of all this could have already done something really nasty with what I've found so far. Bottom line I don't know how much work it would take but we are absolutely going to have to get rid of these binding names as windows properties. A good example is an rss feed, bindings are added and provided through the windows properties that are never seen in regular content, which is why I've been trying to get some script injection into a feed to somehow pass a reference of those bindings to a regular content window, the more binding names you can access the more malicious stuff you can do bottom line. I feel I'm very close to being able to manually set the value property of a file input element now, just going to take a little more finagling and time. I believe this will end up being multiple issues by the time it all plays out and I'm beginning to focus on the wrapper generation too because multiple times lately I have been able to somehow make one of these cloned XUL elements become its XRAY equivalent even at content level while still maintaining access to its properties functions and attributes but it happens randomly usually when switching a clone of an XUL element between being an anonymous child of anonymous content, and actually just appending that element to a regular HTML content document.
So much for keeping that short, just so many issues and I don't actually collaborate with you all as I should which I'm going to start working on. Ill post a few testcases by tomorrow evening showing click-jacking, the firing of events, modifying the src attribute of an anonymous SOW protected iframe, and maybe if I'm lucky some script injection into an rss feed but even if I get that getting anything I could gain with that to a regular content level window would be a trick in itself. Well, that's it until tomorrow evening.

[Accessing true native anonymous content.

â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=804928&action=edit)

This grabs the scale/slider from the audio controls as it plays. document.getBindingParent(anonScale) will then return the video controls. The scale is not protected by SOW protections as it should be(no idea why.) It's also worth noting that even though the video controls should not be able to be cloned using the observe function from XMLPrettyPrint.xml bindings, with a little work it can be.

It's complicated. nsVideoFrame implements nsIAnonymousContentCreator, so when we create a video frame, we go through and mark all of the anonymous content as "native anonymous". See <<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/base/nsCSSFrameConstructor.cpp?rev=1a895d95c88b#3678>> for the gory details. One thing I'm not sure of off the top of my head is how this interacts with the binding in html.css. Is it possible that we actually create \*two\* sets of anonymous content?

Ill touch on this tomorrow, my mind is all over the place tonight so sleep it is. I will say though that after [bug 912322](/show_bug.cgi?id=912322 "RESOLVED FIXED - document.getAnonymous* should not be available to web content") landed there's still a hole there by remapping the valueChanged function, and using the boxObject API once you have access to the anonymous content you can probably get to everything else.

Ill be putting off going over this possibly, as a new bug has came to my attention that is definitely going to take priority over anything like this. Right now with it im already able to load a window to the 'chrome://browser/content/browser.xul' from content, and gain a reference to that window. The window isnt rendered, but does exist and now I'm just going to be working on either finding a way to actually access some of its properties from the reference or go a completely different route and maybe try to load up a data URI hoping it will retain the chrome privileges and use that to access Components, and actually do a proper launch calc.exe poc.

For those interested the previously mentioned bug is up at [bug 920515](/show_bug.cgi?id=920515 "VERIFIED FIXED - pdf.js iframe injection allows sites to load local files or even chrome privileged pages into an iframe"). I'll CC anyone on this one, and soon I'll get back to properly following up on this. Just one error showing up in console led me there, and I've noticed many other things. There's also that crash that I mentioned from this bug, and I've noticed that the base pointer when trying to call a virtual function ends up null and causes the crash and my assembly is bad but that worries me, I found a couple of references to controlling ebp when instances of classes are trying to call virtual functions and having them instead call a malicious attacker supplied function. I haven't forgotten any of these issues I've mentioned here, but there really is so many of them and I have so little time that it's a bit overwhelming.

Uh oh, that sounds like a very different (and potentially dangerous) bug. Please file it and CC me.
In general, it's better not to talk about multiple security issues in the same bug, because we'll open this bug open when the fix lands on all branches, and then we might accidentally expose unpatched issues. I've marked your comment as 'private' to make sure we're safe.

Ah appreciate you taking care of that for me man, Ill be more careful in the future. I can see your proposed fix taking care of that too, because you need an XULElement to apply the proper class to trigger the bindings and once there is no longer access to remap functions on binding names obtaining an XULElement at content level will be tricky. Ill put together a few simple testcases here shortly, I have to admit though that I haven't been doing the most recent testing in nightly, so Ill see how they hold up there, but I think the issue will still be there. Ill be in touch.

This will no longer be the default after the ensuing patch. And while this
fixup doesn't seem necessary to make the tests pass, I'm concerned that this
could cause weirdness for someone using synthesizeMouseEvent (which creates
untrusted events) if the event somehow got bounced to the video NAC. I've
audited these handlers and they're fine to expose.

r=me, but with lots of comments to address.
Pre-existing scariness: I had forgotten this API existed. It's moderately-to-severely scary to me that we copy properties that have JSPropertyOp getters and setters. Do you think we could possibly:
- only copy properties between objects that have the same JSClass; or
- refuse to copy properties with JSPropertyOp getters/setters, with or without an error; or
- some combination of the two,
enforced by run-time checks?
If so, please do. If not, what's the particular use case that needs us to do that?

How perf-sensitive is this? Instead of (or in addition to) asserting, can we check and report an error here if the asserted condition is false?
It is only safe to use |shape| if |obj| is native. Either MOZ\_ASSERT(obj->isNative()) or change the behavior. Depending on your goals here it might be better to do:
- js::GetOwnPropertyDescriptor() to populate a PropertyDescriptor
- the rewrapping
- js::DefineOwnProperty() using the signature that takes a PropertyDescriptor
lookupGeneric consults the prototype chain if there's no own property obj[id], and that's observable by proxies on the prototype chain. GetOwnPropertyDescriptor avoids that. It also works even if obj is non-native.

We can't do that, because when transplanting reflectors, we temporarily copy properties onto a property holder object whose JSClass doesn't match that of the reflector.
> - refuse to copy properties with JSPropertyOp getters/setters, with or
> without an error
I think we could do this. JSPropertyOp accessor props appear as value props to script, so there's no way that script could define them on an unexpecting object, right?
This will alter behavior when transplanting anything that has a resolve hook that defines a JSPropertyOp accessor on the reflector - we'll need to skip silently in those cases. This should be fine, since the resolve hook will presumably just re-run in the target compartment.
Can we do this in a followup bug though? This stack of patches is already risky enough as-is.

I'd really rather not - in my mind, the only use cases for this function happen when the caller is absolutely sure that the property exists. If it doesn't, that's a logic bug in the caller that we should find out about sooner rather than later. I don't see any more value in handling this condition than in handling the case in which the compartment invariants are not what we expect. We should just crash early.

I will MOZ\_ASSERT(obj->isNative()) for the new API, and continue no-oping in the old API for non-native objects. I'll do the GetOwnPropertyDescriptor thing in the followup.

Great. My concern is about letting it pass in opt builds.
You know better than I do how nervous to be about these invariants. To me they seem security-sensitive, and rather custom-purpose in terms of API design, and thus possibly error-prone for users. We could check the asserted preconditions even in opt builds, and MOZ\_CRASH() if it fails. Your call.

... here we anyway deal with all the fields
The setup looks a bit hard to follow. First we enter to xbl scope, install members, enter to bound element scope copy members
and then for each field enter to xbl scope again and install it.
Could we not install all the stuff first and then do the possible non-xbl-scope copying/field setter/getter setup
I think what would make the setup easier to follow.
Feel free to disagree (with some explanation) and re-ask review

We kinda support them, but not really. They're just data properties on the reflector, so for the in-content case (where we use XBL scopes), they're invisible to the XBL without waiving the Xray wrapper. I weaned our use cases off of them in [bug 848939](/show_bug.cgi?id=848939 "RESOLVED FIXED - De-field in-content XBL bindings").
> and then for each field enter to xbl scope again and install it.
No, fields are installed in the bound scope.
The issue is that fields need to be installed on the bound node, and members need to be installed in the XBL compartment, because, in later patches, we only copy \_some\_ of them over to the bound scope (but leave them all available to the XBL scope).
The eventual ordering here (see the rollup) is:
1 - Install members in XBL scope
2 - Copy exposed members into content scope
3 - Install fields in the content scope
We could interchange the order of 2 and 3, but I'm not convinced it would be better.

I don't see that in the patch - the patch doesn't change nsXBLProtoImplField::InstallAccessors.
But yeah, indeed we install in bound scope but create functions in xbl scope.
Could we do that all with less compartment entering. First in xbl scope do whatever we need to
and then enter to bound element scope and do there what we need to.
(performance should be better and hopefully also code readability.)

Because fields have always been installed in the bound scope, so there's nothing to change.

This setup is complicated, for sure. But it's solving a very complicated problem, and it's not obvious to me how to make it simpler. If you have any suggestions (or patches) to improve it, I'd certainly welcome them.

rollup (for context - don't review)
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily. This just locks down a lot of XBL stuff on an architectural level.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think so.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Depending on the branch, backports may be tricky. But ESR24 is probably doable.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This has a high probability of breaking in-content XBL bindings. There aren't many of those that we know of, but we should still be careful.
I recommend landing this on m-c immediately. If there are no regressions within 10 days, we should uplift to aurora. After the next merge, we should then uplift to ESR24, so that this hits release on all channels simultaneously.

Yeah, it's hard to say. There aren't explicit testcases in this bug that I'm worried about, but the issue these patches solve is a general issue that I'm worried about. I'm going to very hand-wavily label this sec-high.Keywords: [sec-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-other&resolution=---) â [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

What about taking it on Beta after Aurora? We've already branched.

Well, it's a somewhat risky change, hence my recommendation at the bottom of [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=911864#c57 "RESOLVED FIXED - Using XBL scopes its possible to steal(clone) native anonymous content."). I wouldn't put up the fight if the release drivers want it for beta though.
I'll nominate this for aurora in 1 week.
> I am concerned about landing tests.
These tests don't reveal anything interesting security-wise. They just verify the behavior that these patches very obviously implement (that bindings must explicitly annotate any member that they wish to expose to content).

Would it be easier from a partner standpoint to do that this cycle as opposed to next cycle?

Is this something that QA can help with ? I am adding mwobensmith as a QA contact here, will be helpful if you can discuss testcases with him to avoid missing out on corner cases.

The testcase in this bug isn't really relevant to my concerns.
Basically, the testcase indicates that we tend to expose more stuff to content than is really safe, so my patches make XBL API exposure to content be opt-in (via a special attribute) instead of opt-out. If anyone was previously trying to expose APIs via in-content XBL bindings, this will break them (though I don't know if anyone does that).
So on the QA side, I think we more or less just need to see if anyone reports broken addons.

Talking to Bobby, it sounds like this is better off landing on b2g26 directly in the next cycle rather than by way of m-b this cycle, but I'll leave the official "wontfix" decision for Firefox 26 to someone else :)

Yep! The reminder for this actually just showed up in my calendar this morning. ;-)
We can't do b2g18 though, because it doesn't have [bug 821850](/show_bug.cgi?id=821850 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate running XBL in a separate compartment"). We'll have to embargo until b2g18 EOL.

This bug is basically just about [bug 911864](/show_bug.cgi?id=911864 "RESOLVED FIXED - Using XBL scopes its possible to steal(clone) native anonymous content.") not going far enough. It doesn't make sense to do an advisory for this bug without one for that bug. I honestly think we should just wait until everything without these fixes is EOLed.Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley+bmo)

This bug is [bug 911864](/show_bug.cgi?id=911864 "RESOLVED FIXED - Using XBL scopes its possible to steal(clone) native anonymous content."). Did you mean [bug 912322](/show_bug.cgi?id=912322 "RESOLVED FIXED - document.getAnonymous* should not be available to web content")?
