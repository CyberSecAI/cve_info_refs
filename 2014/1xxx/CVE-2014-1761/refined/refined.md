  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2014-1761": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Word does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption"
        ],
        "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system, including installing programs, modifying or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Email: Sending a specially crafted RTF email or RTF attachment.",
           "Web-based attacks: Hosting a website with a specially crafted RTF file. Compromised websites or sites accepting user content/ads could also host such files."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open/preview the malicious RTF content. This could be achieved through phishing emails, malicious links, or through compromised websites. The attacker does not need any privileged access to exploit this vulnerability."
