## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Office Web Apps Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2949660)

Published: April 8, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted file is opened or previewed in an affected version of Microsoft Office software. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Word 2013 RT, and for affected Microsoft Office services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, and Microsoft Web Apps Server 2013. This security update is also rated Critical for supported versions of Microsoft Word Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2953095](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2953095).

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

For customers of Microsoft Office for Mac, Microsoft AutoUpdate for Mac can be configured to deliver updates for Microsoft software directly to your system. For more information, see [Check for Office for Mac updates automatically](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=307130).

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Microsoft Office File Format Converter Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1757

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft Office software converts specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1757](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1757).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources

  Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when affected Microsoft Office software does not properly allocate memory while attempting to convert specially crafted, binary-formatted Word documents (.doc) to newer file formats.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an attack scenario using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE), an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to convert the file using MOICE.

**What is MOICE?**

The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) feature that is added to the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack is used to more securely open Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Note** MOICE does not mitigate this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where affected Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected Microsoft Office software, including MOICE, correctly allocates memory when converting specially crafted Word documents.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Microsoft Word Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1758

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Word does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where affected Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Word RTF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1761

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1761](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1761).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Apply the Microsoft Fix it solution, "Disable opening RTF content in Microsoft Word", that prevents exploitation of this issue**

  See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2949660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2949660) to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  **Note** This Microsoft Fix it solution configures the Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of RTF files in supported versions of Microsoft Word.

* **Read emails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the email attack vector, read email messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, Microsoft Outlook 2010, and Microsoft Outlook 2013 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the Read all standard mail in plain text option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607) and [Read email messages in plain text](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=394040).

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1, Office XP Service Pack 2, or Office XP Service Pack 3 can enable this setting and view in plain text only those email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted. Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  **Impact of workaround.** Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition, the following behavior may be experienced:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of RTF files in Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Word 2010, and Microsoft Word 2013**

  You can block specific types of files from being opened or saved in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word by configuring settings in either Group Policy or the Office Customization Tool (OCT). For more information about preventing users from opening specific types of files in Microsoft Office, see [Plan File block settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230).

  To use file block to help protect from exploitation of the vulnerability, configure file block to block RTF files for affected versions of Microsoft Word.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of RTF files in Microsoft Word 2003**

  Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  For Office 2003

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
  "RtfFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open RTF files. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Office 2003

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
  "RtfFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```
* **For Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, disassociate RTF files from Mac Office in OS X's LaunchServices database**

  **Note** This workaround prevents files with the .rtf extension from being automatically opened through file format association. However, users are still vulnerable if they choose to manually open malicious files from within an Office application.

  Use this workaround to prevent Microsoft Office for Mac from opening .rtf files directly and to designate the Finder as the default method for opening .rtf files.

  To do this, open the Finder and perform the following steps:

  1. Select .rtf for the file format you want to disassociate and press Command-I to open the Info dialog box.
  2. In the Open With section, select Other from the menu.
  3. In the Open dialog window that appears, select All Applications from the Enable menu.
  4. Navigate to the MacIntosh HD > System > Library > CoreServices folder and select Finder.
  5. Click Change All in the Info window to make the Finder the default program for opening all files in the selected file format.

  **Note** You will need to re-apply this workaround if you clean your LaunchServices database. Cleaning the LaunchServices database removes your customizations and resets the values from the applications info.plist.

  **Impact of Workaround** Files with the .rtf extension will no longer automatically open through file format association. Instead, when you attempt to open an .rtf file through file format association, the Finder will appear and you can choose to open the file.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Word does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**How is Microsoft Outlook affected by the vulnerability?**

Outlook is not directly affected because the vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. However, if Word is the selected email reader, which is the default case in Microsoft Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013, then an attacker could leverage Outlook for the email attack vector to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF email message to the target user.

**What is RTF?**

Rich Text Format (RTF) is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications and for transfer between applications. Users often depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents between various applications developed by different companies. RTF serves as both a standard of data transfer between word processing software, document formatting, and a means of migrating content from one operating system to another.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open or preview specially crafted RTF-formatted data with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted RTF-formatted data in the contents of an email message. The vulnerability could be exploited when the specially crafted RTF email message is previewed or opened in Outlook while using Microsoft Word as the email viewer. An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF file as an attachment and convincing the user to open or preview the specially crafted RTF file. Note that by default, Microsoft Word is the email reader in Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that try to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Microsoft Office software on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Microsoft Office software.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. SharePoint servers that allow conversion of Word files using Word Automation Services and systems running Microsoft Office Web Apps are also at risk.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-1761](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1761). This vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2953095](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2953095).

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Office Web Apps Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2949660)

Published: April 8, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted file is opened or previewed in an affected version of Microsoft Office software. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Word 2013 RT, and for affected Microsoft Office services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, and Microsoft Web Apps Server 2013. This security update is also rated Critical for supported versions of Microsoft Word Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2953095](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2953095).

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

For customers of Microsoft Office for Mac, Microsoft AutoUpdate for Mac can be configured to deliver updates for Microsoft software directly to your system. For more information, see [Check for Office for Mac updates automatically](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=307130).

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Microsoft Office File Format Converter Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1757

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft Office software converts specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1757](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1757).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources

  Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

* **Read emails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the email attack vector, read email messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, Microsoft Outlook 2010, and Microsoft Outlook 2013 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the Read all standard mail in plain text option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607) and [Read email messages in plain text](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=394040).

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1, Office XP Service Pack 2, or Office XP Service Pack 3 can enable this setting and view in plain text only those email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted. Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  **Impact of workaround.** Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition, the following behavior may be experienced:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of RTF files in Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Word 2010, and Microsoft Word 2013**

  You can block specific types of files from being opened or saved in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word by configuring settings in either Group Policy or the Office Customization Tool (OCT). For more information about preventing users from opening specific types of files in Microsoft Office, see [Plan File block settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230).

  To use file block to help protect from exploitation of the vulnerability, configure file block to block RTF files for affected versions of Microsoft Word.

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of RTF files in Microsoft Word 2003**

  Note Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  For Office 2003

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
  "RtfFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open RTF files. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Office 2003

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]
  "RtfFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```
* **For Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, disassociate RTF files from Mac Office in OS X's LaunchServices database**

  **Note** This workaround prevents files with the .rtf extension from being automatically opened through file format association. However, users are still vulnerable if they choose to manually open malicious files from within an Office application.

  Use this workaround to prevent Microsoft Office for Mac from opening .rtf files directly and to designate the Finder as the default method for opening .rtf files.

  To do this, open the Finder and perform the following steps:

  1. Select .rtf for the file format you want to disassociate and press Command-I to open the Info dialog box.
  2. In the Open With section, select Other from the menu.
  3. In the Open dialog window that appears, select All Applications from the Enable menu.
  4. Navigate to the MacIntosh HD > System > Library > CoreServices folder and select Finder.
  5. Click Change All in the Info window to make the Finder the default program for opening all files in the selected file format.

  **Note** You will need to re-apply this workaround if you clean your LaunchServices database. Cleaning the LaunchServices database removes your customizations and resets the values from the applications info.plist.

  **Impact of Workaround** Files with the .rtf extension will no longer automatically open through file format association. Instead, when you attempt to open an .rtf file through file format association, the Finder will appear and you can choose to open the file.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Word does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**How is Microsoft Outlook affected by the vulnerability?**

Outlook is not directly affected because the vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. However, if Word is the selected email reader, which is the default case in Microsoft Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013, then an attacker could leverage Outlook for the email attack vector to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF email message to the target user.

**What is RTF?**

Rich Text Format (RTF) is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications and for transfer between applications. Users often depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents between various applications developed by different companies. RTF serves as both a standard of data transfer between word processing software, document formatting, and a means of migrating content from one operating system to another.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open or preview specially crafted RTF-formatted data with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted RTF-formatted data in the contents of an email message. The vulnerability could be exploited when the specially crafted RTF email message is previewed or opened in Outlook while using Microsoft Word as the email viewer. An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF file as an attachment and convincing the user to open or preview the specially crafted RTF file. Note that by default, Microsoft Word is the email reader in Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted RTF file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted RTF file.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that try to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Microsoft Office software on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Microsoft Office software.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. SharePoint servers that allow conversion of Word files using Word Automation Services and systems running Microsoft Office Web Apps are also at risk.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-1761](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1761). This vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2953095](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2953095).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
