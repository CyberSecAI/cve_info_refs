  "cve": "CVE-2014-1508",
  "description": "Security researcher Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber of the BlackBerry Security Automated Analysis Team used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover an out-of-bounds read during polygon rendering in MathML. This can allow web content to potentially read protected memory addresses. In combination with previous techniques used for SVG timing attacks, this could allow for text values to be read across domains, leading to information disclosure.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read occurs during polygon rendering in MathML.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Web content can potentially read protected memory addresses. This, in conjunction with SVG timing attack techniques, could lead to cross-domain text value disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "Malicious web content that exploits the MathML polygon rendering vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to present the malicious web content to the victim's browser. The vulnerability is triggered during the rendering of a MathML polygon and does not require a specific attacker position."
