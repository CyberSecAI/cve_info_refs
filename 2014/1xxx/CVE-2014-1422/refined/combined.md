### Bug Description

The bug occurs after removing location access authorization to an application. The location is still available to the application, despite the user having revoked access from within USS > Privacy > Location.

To reproduce:

1. Open a map application, like Here map

2. Allow access to location

3. Switch to System Settings > Privacy > Location

4. Disable location access for Maps

5. Kill Here map, and restart it

What should happen: you should not have access anymore (and should not see a prompt)

What happens instead: the app still has access to your location, as shown in the logs:

I1030 16:15:38.167752 3100 cached\_agent\_glog\_reporter.cpp:32] CachedAgent::authenticate\_request\_with\_parameters: Application pid: 27975 Application uid: 32011 Application id: com.nokia.heremaps\_here Cached request: Request(from: com.nokia.heremaps\_here, feature: 0, when: 1414682114882519283, answer: granted)

I confirmed that the trust store had recorded the authorization change as in:

phablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ sqlite3 ~/.local/share/UbuntuLocationService/trust.db "select \* from requests"

1|unconfined|0|1414098093331252474|1

2|com.nokia.heremaps\_here|0|1414682114882519283|1

3|com.nokia.heremaps\_here|0|1414682131206341515|0

From a user's perspective: Despite having explicitly rejected trust to an application, the app would still be able to access services.

It's great that users can now disable access... but I see two other issues now:

- After disabling access to an app, the app is still shown as being allowed to access location services. Just exit the settings app and re-start it, and the UI shows access as enabled again.

- After disabling access to an app, the user cannot re-enable access. It's shown as enabled, but it no longer works. Toggling the checkbox no longer seems to do anything.
