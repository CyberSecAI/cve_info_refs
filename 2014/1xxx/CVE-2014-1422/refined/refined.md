Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the `trust-store` component of Ubuntu handles cached authorization requests for location services. Specifically, it was discovered that the `trust-store` was not correctly sorting cached authorization requests by timestamp in descending order. This meant that older, granted authorizations could be used even after a user had explicitly revoked location access for an application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Cache Handling:** The primary weakness was the improper sorting of cached authorization requests within the trust store database.
*   **Bypass of User Revocation:** This flaw allowed applications to bypass user-revoked location access permissions by using older, cached "granted" authorizations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Applications could access a user's location even after the user explicitly denied them access through system settings, leading to a privacy violation.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Users would experience unexpected behavior where their chosen privacy settings were ignored.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Application Installation:** An attacker could exploit this by creating or leveraging an application that requests location access.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack involves the user first granting location access, then revoking it. The vulnerability allows the application to retain access via the cached authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **App Development:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an application to request location services.
*   **No Special Privileges:** Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any elevated system privileges.
*   **User Action:** The user needs to initially grant location access to the malicious application and then revoke it through system settings.
