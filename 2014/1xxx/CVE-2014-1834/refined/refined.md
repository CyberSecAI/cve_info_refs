- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The echor Ruby gem exposes login credentials by embedding them directly within a `curl` command in the `lib/echor/backplane.rb` file. Specifically, the command `curl -u {Echo.backplane_user}:{Echo.backplane_password}` includes the username and password in plain text within the command itself.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Exposure of credentials:** Embedding credentials directly in the command line makes them easily visible.
    - **Remote command injection:** If the gem is used in a Rails application, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands by placing a semicolon in the username or password field.
    - **Local credential theft:** A local user can view the login credentials by observing the process table.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    -  The exposure of credentials allows for unauthorized access to the associated system.
    - Local users can obtain credentials through process table inspection.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote command injection through crafted input (semicolon injection).
    -  Local credential theft by viewing the command-line arguments of the running process.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - For remote command injection, the attacker needs the ability to manipulate input to the Rails application using the vulnerable gem.
   - For local credential theft, the attacker needs local access to the system to view the process table.
