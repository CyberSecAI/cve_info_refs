    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Thunderbird resolved hosts in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1532).  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox resolved hosts in certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in `nsHostResolver::ConditionallyRefreshRecord`. It touches `rec->mBlacklistedItems` without holding `rec->addr_info_lock`. This leads to a use-after-free condition because `mBlacklistedItems` can be freed by the socket thread while being accessed.",
