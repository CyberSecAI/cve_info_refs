## BuddyPress 1.9.2

Published on February 5th, 2014 by [John James Jacoby](https://jjj.blog "Visit John James Jacoby’s website")

BuddyPress 1.9.2 is available. This is a security and maintenance release, fixing two possible security issues with Group creation (responsibly disclosed by Pietro Oliva) along with some fixes to our WordPress Menus integration, bp-default theme switching, and improvements to theme compatibility.

A complete list of closed tickets can be found at [the 1.9.2 milestone](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?group=status&milestone=1.9.2), and a full changelog is at <https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-9-2/>.

This is a recommended update for all installations of BuddyPress 1.5+.

Upgrade via your WordPress Dashboard > Updates. You can also download the latest version at [https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/).
