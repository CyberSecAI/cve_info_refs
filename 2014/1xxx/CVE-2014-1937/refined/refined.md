  "cve": "CVE-2014-1937",
  "description": "Gamera before 3.4.1 insecurely creates temporary files.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `tempfile.mktemp()` function, used to create temporary file names, is unsafe as it doesn't guarantee exclusive creation. A malicious local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation using `tempfile.mktemp()`.",
      "Missing the `O_EXCL` flag when creating the temporary file."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious local user can cause a denial of service by creating symlinks or hardlinks in `/tmp` with predictable names generated by `tempfile.mktemp()` and cause the application to behave unexpectedly (e.g., consume excessive CPU and RAM when writing into `/dev/urandom`).",
    "attack_vector": "Local access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious user with local access to the system.",
        "additional_info": "The issue exists in `gamera/io.py`, where `tempfile.mktemp()` generates predictable filenames and does not use the `O_EXCL` flag when creating the files which are used for filtering input files. The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the use of `tempfile.mktemp()`."
