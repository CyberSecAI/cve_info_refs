Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1967:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Denny's App for Android failing to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Verification:** The app does not correctly validate the SSL/TLS certificates of the servers it connects to. This allows for the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Eavesdropping:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can intercept and eavesdrop on the encrypted communication between the app and the server. This could potentially expose sensitive data transmitted by the app, such as user credentials or personal information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The attack vector requires an attacker to position themselves between the app and the server, often by controlling a network the user is connected to (e.g., a malicious Wi-Fi access point).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the app and its server. This can be achieved through a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot or by compromising a network device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed against any user of the vulnerable application on the network segment, regardless of their authentication status with the application.
*   **Low-Mid Complexity:** While some expertise is required to set up and conduct the MITM attack, it is not considered extremely difficult.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Denny's App for Android versions 2.0.0 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1, released on February 12, 2014.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by kurisu and matt.
*   JPCERT/CC rated the severity as "Mid-High" and the user interaction requirement as "High".
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-Other, due to the mapping of JVN iPedia.
