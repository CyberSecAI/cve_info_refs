**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-supplied input parameters before displaying them, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Modification of displayed application content: An attacker could modify the displayed content of the application, potentially misleading users or altering the behavior of the application.
- Potential to obtain authentication information: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal session cookies or other authentication information, potentially leading to account hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs or requests containing malicious script that is not properly encoded when displayed to the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or requests.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the malicious link or submitting the crafted request.
