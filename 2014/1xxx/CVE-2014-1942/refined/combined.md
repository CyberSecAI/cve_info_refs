## Pearson eSIS Enterprise Student Information System XSS vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#163188

Original Release Date: 2014-04-01 | Last Revised: 2014-04-01

---

### Overview

Pearson eSIS Enterprise Student Information System contains a XSS vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html): Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')  Pearson eSIS Enterprise Student Information System contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the /aal/loginverification.aspx page. An attacker is able to load arbitrary script in the context of the user's browser through the data passed to the website. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location.**Do not follow unsolicited links**Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. While this is generally good security practice, following this behavior will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
