Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `signond` handles access control lists (ACLs) for online accounts, particularly those using the OAuth2 plugin. When accounts are created *before* the `signon-apparmor-extension` is installed, the ACL checks are bypassed. This means that any application, with the "accounts" permission in its AppArmor profile, can access the tokens of these accounts, regardless of whether the user has authorized the app to do so.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ACL Bypass:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce ACLs for accounts created prior to the installation of the `signon-apparmor-extension`.
- **Inconsistent Security:** Accounts created after the extension is installed are protected, while those created before are vulnerable.
- **Overly Permissive Access:** Applications with the "accounts" permission can access any account tokens without explicit user authorization, bypassing the intended security model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Token Theft:** A malicious application can steal access tokens for various online accounts (e.g., Evernote, Fitbit) if they were created before the security extension was enabled.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen tokens, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to user data and perform actions on behalf of the user in the corresponding online services.
- **Privacy Violation:** User privacy is severely compromised as attackers can gain control of personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** An attacker would create a malicious application with the "accounts" permission in its AppArmor profile.
- **App Installation:** The attacker would need to get the user to install the malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Application Development:** The attacker needs the ability to develop an application.
- **AppArmor Permission:** The attacker needs to get the "accounts" permission included in the malicious application's AppArmor profile.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to install the malicious application.
- **Timing**: The attacker needs to target users with accounts created before the `signon-apparmor-extension` was installed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects OAuth2 based accounts.
- The bug is triggered if the accounts are created before the security extension is installed.
- The fix involves ensuring that ACL checks are applied to all accounts, regardless of when they were created, once the `signon-apparmor-extension` is installed.
- The `signon-apparmor-extension` package is crucial to enforce the intended security.
- The bug report includes a sample application (`com.blackhat.badapp_0.1_all.click`) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
