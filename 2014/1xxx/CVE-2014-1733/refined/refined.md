Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-1733:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **compiler bug in the Seccomp-BPF (Secure Computing with filters - Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation** within the Chromium browser. Specifically, there's a flaw in how the compiler handles Seccomp-BPF filters, which are meant to restrict the system calls a process can make, thereby enhancing security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Seccomp-BPF Sandbox:** The core issue is that the compiler bug allows an attacker to craft malicious Seccomp-BPF filters that can bypass the intended sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** By bypassing the Seccomp-BPF sandbox, attackers can potentially elevate their privileges and gain access to system resources that should normally be inaccessible, enabling further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** Attackers could potentially embed malicious code in websites or web content that leverages this compiler bug to bypass the sandbox. This requires the victim to visit a compromised site or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve or deliver malicious content**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver web content or another type of file that chromium will process, embedding the malicious Seccomp-BPF filter within.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability**: The attacker needs specific knowledge about the Seccomp-BPF compiler bug to craft a working malicious filter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity, indicating a significant, but not catastrophic, security risk.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jed Davis and was resolved in Chrome version 34.0.1847.132.
*   Multiple Linux distributions were affected by this vulnerability, requiring updates for chromium packages in openSUSE and Debian, and Gentoo.

In essence, CVE-2014-1733 exposes a compiler flaw that enables attackers to circumvent a security mechanism designed to protect the operating system by restricting program access to system resources.
