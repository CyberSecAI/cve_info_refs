## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-glance security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0229)

## Topic

Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issues and multiple
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
individually configuring additional services.

An information leak flaw was found in the way glance stored certain logging
information. An attacker with access to the glance log files could use this
flaw to obtain authentication credentials to the OpenStack Object Storage
(swift) back end. Note that only setups using the swift back end were
affected. (CVE-2014-1948)

The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1065313)

All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the running OpenStack Image services must be manually restarted
(using "service [service name] restart") for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Message-ID: <20140212171443.GB2348@openstack.org>
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2014 17:14:44 +0000
From: Jeremy Stanley <jeremy@...nstack.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: [OSSA 2014-004] Glance Swift store backend password leak
 (CVE-2014-1948)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-004
CVE: CVE-2014-1948
Date: February 12, 2014
Title: Glance Swift store backend password leak
Reporter: Nikhil Komawar (Rackspace)
Products: Glance
Versions: 2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.1

Description:
Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance
logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING
level as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if
image location is not disabled by policy or the store is a
single-tenant configuration. An attacker with access to the logs
(local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may
leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct
full access to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups
using the Swift store backend are affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/71419>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/72473>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-2 development milestone
and the upcoming 2013.2.2 release.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1064589#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-12 22:48:40 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported [1],[2] in OpenStack Glance 2013.2 versions up to and including 2013.2.1 and is described as follows:   Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING level as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if image location is not disabled by policy or the store is a single-tenant configuration. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store backend are affected.   This has been corrected in upstream git [3] and version 2013.2.2.

An user can upload an image to glance with a --location swift-url, using his own swift account. Maybe the leak is not the default swift store present in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf but the user account.

Also it is not clear what can make the authentication request to fail. Is it a connection problem, or when the user change his password ?

@nikhil komawar can you confirm the proposed description ?

This error was happening on the default (operator) swift store account.

Logging happens at this part of the code: <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/store/__init__.py#L716>

The case when I saw this was: when the call was happening while a user token was being used to get image data for an image that is publicized using the export task functionality. (The code is not upstream yet). However, the user does not have the right context to use that image.

Haven't had a chance to explore more permutations of invalid context for the user when this line would be logged. In any case, I believe that we should remove logging such sensitive info from the code.

+1 on description. Should it mention "Swift store" rather than "store" ?

Nikhil: Right, if the intent was to report the issue in private then any fixes should have been attached as patches directly to the bug instead of submitting to public code review. Ultimately it's up to the discretion of the bug reporter as to whether we observe an embargo period on the report and discuss the vulnerability and fixes in private, or whether it is reported/fixed in public.

Ultimately it's up to the discretion of the bug reporter as to whether we observe an embargo period on the report and discuss the vulnerability and fixes in private, or whether it is reported/fixed in public.

Is grizzly actually impacted? It looks like this log line was introduced in <https://review.openstack.org/35734> which only appears in release tags 2013.2 and 2013.2.1...

Here's an updated impact description incorporating Thierry's suggestion from comment #7 along with our recently revised format and my guess above about affected versions. I'll go ahead and request a CVE on the oss-security for this if nobody objects.

Title: Glance Swift store backend password leak

Reporter: Nikhil Komawar (Rackspace)

Products: Glance

Versions: 2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.1

Description:

Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING level as part of the URL when authentication to the requested store fails. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store backend are affected.

A very minor nit on the description.

There are two flavours of Swift store: Single Tenant and Multi Tenant. Typically in the case of Multi Tenant no credentials are stored in the location field. If set\_image\_location is disabled by policy then there is no credentials leak for Multi Tenant mode. I wonder if something like the following should be considered:

"Only Glance setups which use the Swift store are affected. In the case of a Multi Tenant Swift "

 "store where 'set\_image\_location' is disabled by policy there is no vulnerability. In the case of a Single Tenant "

 "Swift store backend an attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, "

 "or accidental leak) may potentially leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain "

 "full direct access to the Glance Swift store backend. In the case of both Single and Multi Tenant Swift "

 "store backends where the set\_image\_location policy is not disabled, an attacker with access "

 "to the logs may potentially access any credentials contained in locations which have "

 "been explicitly set by any user. "

I concede to not being familiar enough with Swift's various deployment models, but do worry about getting overly specific about identifying affected configurations. The goal is to provide enough detail that the lowest-common-denominator operator/sysadmin can determine whether they should upgrade/apply the patch, without getting into the weeds and without being so verbose that they stop reading (which usually happens after the first few sentences). How about...

I wouldn't worry too much about updating the bug description. My comment was more so as to finalize the wording which we'll be using the the CVE request and subsequent security advisory.

According to MITRE this gets CVE-2014-1948, but Launchpad doesn't yet think that's a real CVE number so I haven't linked it.

Confirmed, this is similar to OSSA 2013-031. Proposed impact description (based on that one for now)...

Title: Glance store backend password leak

Reporter: Nikhil Komawar (Rackspace)

Products: Glance

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance logs. The password for the store backend is logged at WARNING level as part of the URL when authentication to the requested store fails. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Glance store backend. Only Glance setups using the store backend are affected.

An user can upload an image to glance with a --location swift-url, using his own swift account. Maybe the leak is not the default swift store present in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf but the user account.

Also it is not clear what can make the authentication request to fail. Is it a connection problem, or when the user change his password ?

@nikhil komawar can you confirm the proposed description ?

This error was happening on the default (operator) swift store account.

Logging happens at this part of the code: <https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/store/__init__.py#L716>

The case when I saw this was: when the call was happening while a user token was being used to get image data for an image that is publicized using the export task functionality. (The code is not upstream yet). However, the user does not have the right context to use that image.

Haven't had a chance to explore more permutations of invalid context for the user when this line would be logged. In any case, I believe that we should remove logging such sensitive info from the code.

Nikhil: Right, if the intent was to report the issue in private then any fixes should have been attached as patches directly to the bug instead of submitting to public code review. Ultimately it's up to the discretion of the bug reporter as to whether we observe an embargo period on the report and discuss the vulnerability and fixes in private, or whether it is reported/fixed in public.

This patch removes logging of sensitive store location uri, which

    is logged when an exception occurs while trying to get the object

    from the store or due to a failure in getting the store api due to

    unauthorized context.

Is grizzly actually impacted? It looks like this log line was introduced in <https://review.openstack.org/35734> which only appears in release tags 2013.2 and 2013.2.1...

Here's an updated impact description incorporating Thierry's suggestion from comment #7 along with our recently revised format and my guess above about affected versions. I'll go ahead and request a CVE on the oss-security for this if nobody objects.

A very minor nit on the description.

There are two flavours of Swift store: Single Tenant and Multi Tenant. Typically in the case of Multi Tenant no credentials are stored in the location field. If set\_image\_location is disabled by policy then there is no credentials leak for Multi Tenant mode. I wonder if something like the following should be considered:

"Only Glance setups which use the Swift store are affected. In the case of a Multi Tenant Swift "

 "store where 'set\_image\_location' is disabled by policy there is no vulnerability. In the case of a Single Tenant "

 "Swift store backend an attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, "

 "or accidental leak) may potentially leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain "

 "full direct access to the Glance Swift store backend. In the case of both Single and Multi Tenant Swift "

 "store backends where the set\_image\_location policy is not disabled, an attacker with access "

 "to the logs may potentially access any credentials contained in locations which have "

 "been explicitly set by any user. "

I concede to not being familiar enough with Swift's various deployment models, but do worry about getting overly specific about identifying affected configurations. The goal is to provide enough detail that the lowest-common-denominator operator/sysadmin can determine whether they should upgrade/apply the patch, without getting into the weeds and without being so verbose that they stop reading (which usually happens after the first few sentences). How about...

Title: Glance Swift store backend password leak

Reporter: Nikhil Komawar (Rackspace)

Products: Glance

Versions: 2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.1

Description:

Nikhil Komawar from Rackspace reported an information leak in Glance logs. The password for the Swift store backend is logged at WARNING level as part of the URL when authentication to a store fails if image location is not disabled by policy or the store is a single-tenant configuration. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell, log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the Glance Swift store backend. Only Glance setups using the Swift store backend are affected.

I wouldn't worry too much about updating the bug description. My comment was more so as to finalize the wording which we'll be using the the CVE request and subsequent security advisory.

According to MITRE this gets CVE-2014-1948, but Launchpad doesn't yet think that's a real CVE number so I haven't linked it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
