Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1985:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2014-1985 and provides detailed information related to the vulnerability. Therefore, the content is considered relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **open redirect** issue found in Redmine.
*   The root cause is **insufficient checking of the URL parameter** used for redirection, specifically, the `back_url` parameter.
*   The code was accepting scheme-relative URIs, which allows for redirection to different hosts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to redirect users to arbitrary external websites. This is caused by inadequate validation of the `back_url` parameter.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation for the redirect URL. The application doesn't sufficiently check or sanitize the URL before using it in a redirect.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** A successful exploit can redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks where attackers can steal credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **User Compromise:** By redirecting to malicious sites, attackers can potentially deliver malware or exploit other browser-based vulnerabilities to further compromise user systems.
*   **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the Redmine application if they are repeatedly redirected to untrusted or unexpected sites.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `back_url` parameter in a Redmine URL, specifically in the login process.
*   **Scheme-Relative URIs:** Attackers can use scheme-relative URIs (e.g., `//malicious.com/path`) which, due to insufficient validation, allows bypassing host checks and leading to redirection to other hosts.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Redmine instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** While the vulnerability is related to the login process, the attack can be initiated by crafting a URL with a malicious `back_url` parameter, which the user would then click.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can rely on social engineering to trick users into clicking the manipulated URL, leading to the redirect and potentially malicious activities.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved changing the `application_controller.rb` file to correctly validate the `back_url` parameter.
*   The specific change was in the `redirect_back_or_default` method where the validation was adjusted to prevent redirection to external hosts or the login/register pages.
*   The code now validates that the provided URI is either relative with a valid starting path or that the host matches the current request host. It also checks for redirection to login/register pages and prevents it.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Redmine versions prior to 2.5.1
*   Redmine versions prior to 2.4.5

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Redmine 2.5.1 and later
*   Redmine 2.4.5 and later

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is documented in JVN#93004610.
*   The issue was reported to IPA by Minoru Sakai of SCSK Corporation.

In summary, CVE-2014-1985 is a moderately severe open redirect vulnerability in Redmine caused by insufficient input validation of the `back_url` parameter, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites. The vulnerability is fixed in Redmine versions 2.5.1 and 2.4.5 and later.
