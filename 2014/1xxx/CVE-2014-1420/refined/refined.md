Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is indeed related to CVE-2014-1420:

**Root Cause:**
The `StateSaver` component in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit was saving state files in the `/tmp` directory by default. It was using `QSettings` with `QFile::open(QFile::ReadWrite)` which does not set the `O_EXCL` flag when opening the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** Saving data in `/tmp` makes the application vulnerable to symlink attacks. An attacker could create a symlink in `/tmp` with the same name as the state file, pointing to a different location. When the application attempts to write to the state file, it would instead write to the attacker-controlled location.
- **Lack of O_EXCL Flag:** The absence of the `O_EXCL` flag in the file open operation means that if a file already exists at the specified location, `QFile::open` will open the existing file instead of failing. This allows an attacker to create a file prior to the application writing to it, leading to potential data corruption, information disclosure, or privilege escalation in case of symlink exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system by creating a symlink in `/tmp` before the application creates the state file. This could lead to various impacts like:
    - Data corruption
    - Denial of service by corrupting system files.
    - Privilege escalation by overwriting sensitive configuration files or executables, which could potentially allow an attacker to run code with the privileges of the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has local access to the system and can create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker creates a symlink in `/tmp` to a file they wish to manipulate or overwrite.
- **Application Execution:** When the vulnerable application runs, it writes its state to the symlinked location instead of to a file under `/tmp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the affected system.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks and files within `/tmp`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by changing the location where the `StateSaver` saves state files from `/tmp` to a runtime location using `QStandardPaths::RuntimeLocation` which defaults to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
*   The fix was not initially backported to Trusty but was later addressed after being identified as a main pocket package, and therefore needing security updates.
*   The use of `QTemporaryFile` was considered as a solution, but not implemented.
*   The bug report mentions that confined applications have their own `TMPDIR` which mitigates the issue. However, desktop applications were vulnerable.
