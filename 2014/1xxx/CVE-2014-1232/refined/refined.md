    {
      "source": "wordpress.org_a805f3c2_20250125_051042.html",
      "vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Foliopress WYSIWYG WordPress plugin, which uses a vulnerable version of FCKeditor. The changelog mentions 'security enhancements' in version 2.6.8 and a fix for an XSS vulnerability in an unused part of the plugin in version 2.6.8.5.  Additionally, version 2.6.11 addresses security issues with the built-in spell checker in FCKEditor (though the plugin doesn't use it), suggesting that the plugin is affected by vulnerabilities present in the embedded FCKEditor.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Use of vulnerable third party component (FCKeditor/CKEditor)",
        "XSS vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to security compromises, such as unauthorized access or code execution within the context of the WordPress site. The XSS vulnerability could be used to perform actions on behalf of a user or to redirect the user to a malicious site.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Through the WYSIWYG editor, by injecting malicious code via vulnerable FCKeditor component",
        "XSS attacks through a vulnerable part of the plugin."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to exploit the vulnerabilities in FCKEditor/CKEditor or in a part of the plugin code. Access to a privileged account on the WordPress site would be required in most scenarios. The XSS vulnerability can be triggered when viewing posts or pages containing the injected malicious code.",
       "additional_details": "The plugin uses FCKEditor which is an old version of CKEditor, a known vulnerable component. The changelog also indicates that 'SEO Images' functionality has been removed due to PHP 7 compatibility issues, which could be an indication of other potential code issues in the plugin. The plugin may also have issues related to image handling, as indicated by the numerous fixes related to it."
