Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the way the Nokia Maps Places WordPress plugin handled the `href` attribute within the `nokia-maps` shortcode. The plugin was directly extracting a place identifier from the full URL provided in the `href` attribute using a regular expression, instead of just extracting the place ID, before using it in the iframe `src`. This made it vulnerable to URL injection, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was XSS. By injecting malicious code into the `href` attribute of the shortcode, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the embedded map.
*   **Insecure URL Handling:** The plugin's direct use of a regular expression to extract place identifiers from the URL without proper sanitization created the vulnerability. The full URL was not validated or sanitized before being used in the iframe `src`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers could alter the content of the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or display misleading information.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker might be able to deface the website.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker might use the injected content for phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Shortcode:** The attack vector was through the `nokia-maps` shortcode. An attacker could inject malicious URLs into the `href` attribute of this shortcode when creating or editing a post.
*   **WordPress Editor:** A user with sufficient permissions to add or edit posts or pages could introduce this malicious shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User with Posting/Editing Permissions:** An attacker needed to have the ability to add/edit content within a WordPress site that used the vulnerable plugin. This could be an administrator, editor, or contributor, depending on the website's configuration.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** An attacker needs to know that the target site is running the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by:
    *   Extracting only the place identifier and context from the `href` attribute, instead of the full URL, using regular expressions.
    *   Removing the `href` attribute after extracting the place ID to prevent URL injection.
    * Adding context to the placeid when stored.

* The vulnerable code was present in the `nokia_place_shortcode` function within the `nokia-mapsplaces.php` file.
* The specific regex used before the fix was `([\w\d]{8}-[\w\d]{32}[;context=\w\d]\*)`.
* The fix was implemented in revisions 841883 and 842384 of the plugin's source code.
* The vulnerable version was 1.6.6.
