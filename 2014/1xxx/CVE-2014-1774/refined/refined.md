Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-1774:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-035 specifically lists **CVE-2014-1774** as an "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability". This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can corrupt memory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue. When Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory, it can corrupt the memory.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
*   **User Rights:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.
*   **System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This allows for activities such as installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit this vulnerability. They then convince a user to view the malicious content.
*   **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can use phishing tactics by embedding malicious links in emails or instant messages, or by attaching malicious files.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver the specially crafted web content to the targeted user.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must rely on social engineering or another method to convince the user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious file using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
*   **No Direct System Access Required:** The attack is primarily web-based and does not require initial access to the user's system.

**7. Affected Versions**

*   According to the provided table, Internet Explorer 9 is vulnerable to CVE-2014-1774. The vulnerability is rated as "Critical / RCE" on Windows clients and "Moderate / RCE" on Windows servers. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 are not listed as vulnerable to this specific CVE.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** The bulletin does mention that systems with user accounts configured with fewer rights could be less impacted, and enhanced security configurations on servers could reduce the likelihood of exploitation. Also, Microsoft EMET was another mechanism to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Workarounds:**  The document provides workarounds like prompting before running scripts, disabling scripting, setting security levels to high, and adding trusted sites to the trusted sites zone.
*   **Public Disclosure:**  CVE-2014-1774 was not publicly disclosed at the time of the bulletin release.
*   **Exploitation:** Microsoft had not received any reports of active exploitation of this specific vulnerability at the time of the bulletin's publication.

In summary, CVE-2014-1774 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer 9 that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system via a specially crafted webpage.
