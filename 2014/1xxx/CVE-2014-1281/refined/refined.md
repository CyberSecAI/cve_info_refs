  "CVE-2014-1281": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Deleting an image from the asset library did not delete cached versions of the image.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper cache management when deleting images. Specifically, when an image is deleted from the asset library, cached versions of the image are not also deleted.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Deleted images may still appear in the Photos app underneath transparent images.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by deleting an image from the asset library. If the cached versions of the image are not also deleted, the deleted image can be visible under a transparent image in the Photos app.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to delete an image from the asset library and view images from the Photos App"
  }
