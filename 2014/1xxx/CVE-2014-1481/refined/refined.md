Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-1481:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the inconsistent handling of the `this` value when invoking JavaScript native getters on `window` objects across different JavaScript engines. Specifically, IonMonkey JIT compiler did not outerize the this value leading to a different behavior than the interpreter which did perform outerization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent behavior in JavaScript engines when accessing `window` object getters.
- A possibility for a security bypass due to discrepancies in how `this` was handled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential bypass of security checks.
- Possibility of arbitrary code execution by exploiting the different treatment of window objects by the Javascript engines.
- Potential for XSS attacks or information disclosure if exploited in combination with other weaknesses.
- Although less likely, there was a potential to steal confidential data or execute code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious websites or HTML content (particularly in situations where scripting is enabled)
- Exploitation could happen by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted website or viewing content with enabled scripting.
- A combination of weaknesses along with the different treatment of window objects by the Javascript engines.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious website/content with specially crafted JavaScript to exploit the discrepancy.
- Requires the victim to visit the crafted webpage or open the content with scripting enabled.
- No other specific capabilities/positions are noted.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is linked to the way JSNative getters are handled by different JavaScript engines, particularly the IonMonkey JIT compiler, and how the `this` value is passed to them.
- There's a discussion about whether accessing inner window objects presents a security problem post-compartments, suggesting that the primary concern was the inconsistency rather than an easily exploitable vulnerability directly from this issue.
- The fix involved ensuring consistent behavior across interpreter, baseline, and Ion JIT compilers. For branches lacking the fix, disabling the NameIC for bareword getters was implemented.
- There was a specific test case which showed the ability to retrieve an inner window object, which was then used to demonstrate the inconsistency and the need to address it.
- Several different patches were created in the process of fixing this vulnerability for different branches.
