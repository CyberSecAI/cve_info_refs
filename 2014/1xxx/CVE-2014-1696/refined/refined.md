- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SIMATIC WinCC OA server application uses a weak hashing algorithm for project users' credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the affected WinCC OA server application through brute-force attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically through brute-force attempts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the WinCC OA server and the capability to perform brute-force password cracking attempts. No authentication is initially required.
