- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the Windows Shell improperly handling file associations when a specially crafted application uses the ShellExecute API function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of file associations by the ShellExecute API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the Local System account, leading to the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights (privilege escalation).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to log on to the system and then execute a specially crafted application using the ShellExecute API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
