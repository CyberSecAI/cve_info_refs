## Vulnerability in Windows Shell Handler Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2962488)

Published: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker runs a specially crafted application that uses ShellExecute. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the ShellExecute API handles file associations in certain circumstances. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Windows Shell File Association Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1807

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Shell improperly handles file associations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the Local System account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1807](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1807).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when a specially crafted application uses the ShellExecute Application Programming Interface (API) function to improperly handle file associations.

**What is the Windows Shell?**

The Windows user interface (UI) provides users with access to a wide variety of objects necessary for running applications and managing the operating system. The most numerous and familiar of these objects are the folders and files that reside on computer disk drives. There are also a number of virtual objects that allow the user to perform tasks such as sending files to remote printers or accessing the Recycle Bin. The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects.

**What is ShellExecute?**

ShellExecute is part of the Windows Shell API functions. It performs an operation on a specified file. This could for instance mean invoking the correct handler for that specific file type. More information on the ShellExecute function can be found in the MSDN article, [ShellExecute Function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb762153%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?**

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions you can use to work with a component, application, or operating system. Typically, an API consists of one or more DLLs that provide some specific functionality.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the Local System account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to elevate privileges.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the ShellExecute API handles file associations in certain circumstances.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, seeÂ [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).
