- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow existed in the handling of 'clef' atoms within QuickTime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing 'clef' atoms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Playing a maliciously crafted movie file could lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by playing a specially crafted movie file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious movie file with crafted 'clef' atoms and have the victim open this file with a vulnerable version of QuickTime.
