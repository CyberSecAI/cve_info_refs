Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1885:

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-1885 is assigned to a specific vulnerable instance of a PhoneGap application, "ForzeArmate," identified in research. This vulnerability stems from a general issue with how PhoneGap applications handle whitelisting and bridge access, allowing malicious scripts to bypass intended security measures. The CVE is an example of a broader class of vulnerabilities described in the associated research paper.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way PhoneGap apps (and likely other hybrid app frameworks) implement security controls, specifically:
*   **Inadequate Whitelisting:**  The application's use of a whitelist that is not properly enforced, allowing unauthorized content to be loaded. This is related to the broader issue that PhoneGap's whitelisting implementation had weaknesses like missing end-of-string anchors.
*  **Vulnerable Bridges:** The app uses a framework with vulnerable bridges, allowing JavaScript on the Web side to select these bridges and bypass security restrictions
*   **Lack of proper iframe isolation:** Malicious JavaScript inside iframes can exploit bridges and access local resources, which goes against the principle of least privilege.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Whitelist Enforcement:** The app fails to properly restrict access to authorized domains/resources. The broad issue is that PhoneGap's whitelisting mechanism did not properly anchor the expressions for each whitelisted domain.
*   **Bridge Exploitation:** Malicious scripts can invoke functions intended for framework use, but without any access control leading to exploitation of vulnerable bridges. This allows the attacker to bypass framework defenses.
*   **Bypass of Same Origin Policy (SOP):** The application fails to prevent malicious code from accessing local resources via event-based bridges, even when confined in iframes.
*   **Incorrect Content Loading:** The app does not properly handle content loading for iframes, allowing the inclusion of unauthorized content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Application Control:** An attacker can take control over the parent application through malicious Javascript.
*   **Access to local resources:** Malicious code can access local resources via event-based bridges.
*   **Loading of unauthorized content:** The application can be made to load unauthorized content from malicious sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into the application's WebView, often via compromised ads or other external content.
*   **Exploitation of Framework Functions:** The vulnerability allows malicious code to directly access and abuse framework functions meant for internal use, thereby bypassing security controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject or control Javascript code within the WebView context.** This might be achieved through malicious advertisements, or by compromising a content source used by the app.
*   **Understanding of the target application's structure** and the underlying framework, allowing the attacker to exploit the vulnerable bridges and function calls.
* **Knowledge of the app's vulnerable implementation**. The attacker needs to know how the app implements whitelisting and bridge access to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This CVE is one of several assigned to vulnerabilities discovered in a research paper on hybrid application security.
*   The CVE is assigned to a specific app (ForzeArmate) as an example of the broader issues, with the note that many other apps could be similarly vulnerable.
* The associated research paper identified a number of attack vectors and vulnerabilities in PhoneGap (Cordova) on Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry platforms.
