Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-1829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `python-requests` library was not properly handling authentication headers during HTTP redirects. Specifically, when a request to a site (site A) was redirected to another site (site B), and the user had authentication credentials for site A stored in their `~/.netrc` file, the library would send those credentials to both site A and the redirected site B.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive authentication credentials (passwords stored in `~/.netrc`) to unintended servers during redirects.
*   **Improper Header Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the library's failure to drop or re-evaluate authentication headers when a redirect occurs. It was reusing the Authorization header for the new request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker controlling a server that initiates a redirect can potentially steal the user's credentials for other sites. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to services or data protected by the exposed credentials.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposing credentials not only leads to security breaches but also violates the user's privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Redirects:** An attacker can set up a web server that redirects requests to another malicious server. If the userâ€™s `~/.netrc` file contains credentials for the first server, `python-requests` will send them to the second, attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Server Control:** The attacker needs to control a web server capable of issuing redirects.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to make a request to the attacker-controlled server with `python-requests`.
*   **`~/.netrc` Usage:** The attack requires the user to have stored credentials in their `~/.netrc` file for the original domain.

In summary, this vulnerability allows for a man-in-the-middle style attack where an attacker gains access to credentials by exploiting `python-requests`'s flawed handling of redirects and authorization headers when the user has credentials stored in `~/.netrc`.
