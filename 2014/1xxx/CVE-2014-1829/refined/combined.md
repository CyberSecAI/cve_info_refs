# USN-2382-1: Requests vulnerabilities

14 October 2014

Requests could be made to expose authentication credentials over the
network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [requests](/security/cves?package=requests) - elegant and simple HTTP library for Python

## Details

Jakub Wilk discovered that Requests incorrectly reused authentication

credentials after being redirected. An attacker could possibly use this

issue to obtain authentication credentials intended for another site.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-26 11:48:44 UTC  ``` Python-requests was found to have a vulnerability, where the attacker can retrieve the passwords from ~/.netrc file through redirect requests, if the user has their passwords stored in the ~/.netrc file.  If site A redirects to site B, and user had a password for site A in their ~/.netrc, then requests would send authorization information both to site A and to site B.  References: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=733108>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-26 11:50:40 UTC  ```  Created python-requests tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1046627](show_bug.cgi?id=1046627 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-1829 CVE-2014-1830 python-requests: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1046628](show_bug.cgi?id=1046628 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-1829 CVE-2014-1830 python-requests: various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c3)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-26 11:56:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 841867](attachment.cgi?id=841867 "Test Case to reproduce this bug.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=841867&action=edit "Test Case to reproduce this bug.") Test Case to reproduce this bug.  Some test scripts are attached to reproduce the bug, when executed, gives a Base64 encoded string, which when decoded, gives the username:password stored in the ~/.netrc file.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c4)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2014-01-20 19:16:43 UTC  ``` Ratul, the attached test scripts seem to work with python 3 only. Could you provide test scripts for python 2 too? Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c5)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2014-01-20 20:11:15 UTC  ``` According to the Debian bug linked above, the problem happens on python3-requests version 2.0.0. Fedora 20 only has python-requests and python3-requests version 1.2.3. Running the python3 test scripts above on Fedora 20 did not reproduce the problem.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-28 08:09:18 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report: <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1885>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c13)  Daniele Tricoli    2014-01-28 17:08:05 UTC  ``` Hello, I'm the Debian maintainer of python-requests: the issue is also present in the Python2 version. You can run testhttpclient.py also using Python2 (only testhttpserve.py is Python3 only, but the server part is not importat for this issue) and you will get the same result. See what upstream replied me: <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1885#issuecomment-33436124>  Cheers!   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c14)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2014-01-28 17:31:37 UTC  ``` Hi Daniele, yes, I didn't run the test correctly. I can reproduce the problem on F20 now. Is the code in the above link supposed to be the final solution? Is there any test case for Proxy-Authorization?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c15)  Daniele Tricoli    2014-01-31 12:57:47 UTC  ``` Hello Endi, sorry for the delay in my reply.  The final solution should be this:  <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/1892>  But as you can see Kenneth said that he needs to think about this.  I'm not aware of a test case for Proxy-Authorization but I asked for it in upstream traker[¹] and they replied that it will be addressed before the next release[²].  As I said in [¹] I don't know if you already requested a CVE for this, anyway upstream is going to ask for one.  [¹] <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1885#issuecomment-33790719> [²] <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1885#issuecomment-33791215>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c16)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-21 11:47:49 UTC  ``` Victims Record:  <https://github.com/victims/victims-cve-db/blob/master/database/python/2014/1829.yaml>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c17)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-22 01:14:05 UTC  ```  Created python-requests tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1144910](show_bug.cgi?id=1144910 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-1829 CVE-2014-1830 python-requests: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1046626#c20)  Vincent Danen    2015-01-21 17:23:30 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of python-requests as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they included a fix for this issue at GA.  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

Package: python3-requests
Version: 2.0.0-1
Tags: security

If site A redirects to site B, and user had a password for site A in
their ~/.netrc, then requests would send authorization information both
to site A and to site B.

I've attached a netrc file and a pair of test scripts that should help
reproducing the bug.

Thanks for taking care of closing this. I received the notification from
github, but I will work on requests (I plan to update to 2.4.1) on the
weekend.

To acknowledge the fix of this security bug, I should put something in the
changelog anyway, right?
Something like this:
  * Acknowledge fix for [CVE-2014-1829](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1829) and [CVE-2014-1830](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1830) in 2.3.0-1
    (Closes: #[733108](bugreport.cgi?bug=733108))

Developer reference[¹] says: "When closing security bugs include CVE numbers
as well as the Closes: #nnnnn. This is useful for the security team to track
vulnerabilities. If an upload is made to fix the bug before the advisory ID is
known, it is encouraged to modify the historical changelog entry with the next
upload."

So using "Closes: #733108" although the bug is arleady closed seems ok to me,
is that right?

Many thanks!

Kind regards,

As the DevRef suggests, you should retroactively add the CVE reference
to the changelog entry for 2.3.0-1, so don't mention "in 2.3.0-1".

>So using "Closes: #733108" although the bug is arleady closed seems ok

Yup, that should be fine.

Package        : requests
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1829 CVE-2014-1830
Debian Bug     : 733108

Jakub Wilk discovered that in requests, an HTTP library for the Python
language, authentication information was improperly handled when a
redirect occured. This would allow remote servers to obtain two
different types of sensitive information: proxy passwords from the
Proxy-Authorization header (CVE-2014-1830), or netrc passwords from
the Authorization header (CVE-2014-1829).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.
