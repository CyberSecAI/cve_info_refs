Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1372:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read issue existed in the handling of a system call within the graphics driver.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact:**
- A local user can read kernel memory.
- This vulnerability can be leveraged to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability. A local user can trigger the vulnerable system call within the graphics driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the specific vulnerable system call related to the graphics driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The fix involves improved bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
