{
  "CVE-2014-1526": {
    "Description": "The debugger in Firefox and SeaMonkey will work with some objects while bypassing XrayWrappers, which could lead to privilege escalation if the debugger is used to interact with a malicious page.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The debugger was unwrapping objects using XrayWrappers, which are meant to prevent access to privileged objects from untrusted code, allowing direct access to DOM methods on the unwrapped object.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Bypassing XrayWrappers",
      "Direct access to DOM methods on unwrapped object"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation by executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the browser.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "User needs to use the debugger to interact with a malicious page."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to trick a user into using the debugger while browsing a malicious website"
  }
