  "cveId": "CVE-2014-1480",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "The provided content describes a clickjacking vulnerability in the download dialog of Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey.  The vulnerability exists due to the lack of a sufficient security timeout before button presses are processed, allowing a malicious website to trick users into selecting unintended options within the download dialog.",
  "details": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause is the insufficient delay implemented in the download dialog before processing button clicks, making it susceptible to clickjacking attacks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Clickjacking: The vulnerability allows an attacker to overlay the legitimate download dialog with a crafted interface, tricking the user into clicking the 'Open' or 'Execute' option when they intend to 'Save' the file."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the user unintentionally executing downloaded files, potentially compromising their system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A remote attacker could create a malicious website designed to overlay the browser's download dialog with a fake interface.",
      "The attacker would induce the user to initiate a download.",
      "The attacker would then trick the user into double-clicking to initiate execution of the download."
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create a website that can display a malicious interface to trick users during file downloads. This requires the ability to create a web page and have a user visit it while they initiate a download.",
    "patches": [
      "The vulnerability is fixed by implementing a sufficient delay (1000ms) in the download dialog before processing button clicks. This delay mitigates the risk of clickjacking."
