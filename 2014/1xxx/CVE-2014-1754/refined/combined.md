## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2952166)

Published: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves multiple privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office server and productivity software. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an authenticated attacker sends specially crafted page content to a target SharePoint server.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010, and Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2013. For more information, see the Affected and Non-Affected Software section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SharePoint Server and Web Applications sanitize specially crafted page content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

**Note for SharePoint Server** The detection tools (such as Microsoft Update, WSUS, MBSA, SMS, and System Center Configuration Manager) are applicable for single-server Microsoft SharePoint Server deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the updates on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm. For recommended instructions on how to apply updates to SharePoint Server, see [Deploy software updates for SharePoint 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc263467).

**Note for Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013** Applying Office Web Apps Server updates by using the automatic updates process is not supported with Office Web Apps Server. For recommended instructions on how to apply updates to Office Web Apps Server, see [Apply software updates to Office Web Apps Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj966220).

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, see [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

**Note for SharePoint Server** The detection tools (such as Microsoft Update, WSUS, MBSA, SMS, and System Center Configuration Manager) are applicable for single-server Microsoft SharePoint Server deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the updates on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm. For recommended instructions on how to apply updates to SharePoint Server, see [Deploy software updates for SharePoint 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc263467).

**Note for Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013** Applying Office Web Apps Server updates by using the automatic updates process is not supported with Office Web Apps Server. For recommended instructions on how to apply updates to Office Web Apps Server, see [Apply software updates to Office Web Apps Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj966220).
