- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused when SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the logged-on user. This could lead to unauthorized reading of content, actions taken on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim (like changing permissions and deleting content), and injecting malicious content in the browser of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the target SharePoint server.
