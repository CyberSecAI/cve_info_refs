Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:**  The core issue is that improper memory access leads to memory corruption. This corruption can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
    - If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based attacks:**
    - Attackers can host a malicious website crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
    - Compromised websites or those accepting user-generated content/ads can also be used to deliver the exploit.
    - An attacker would need to trick the user into visiting these malicious sites, typically by using links in emails/instant messages or by getting users to open email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to host or inject content into web pages:** Attackers must be capable of setting up or compromising web resources to deliver the exploit to the victim.
- **Social engineering:** Attackers need to convince the victim to browse the malicious content, typically via phishing techniques or compromised websites.
- No special user privileges are needed by the attacker on the target system.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-035, which provides a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer.
- The update corrects the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, preventing memory corruption.
- The vulnerability is rated "Critical" for Windows clients and "Important" for Windows servers.
- The provided document lists multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities, including CVE-2014-1791, which are resolved by this security update.
- The document contains detailed tables listing the affected versions of Internet Explorer and the corresponding update files.

In summary, CVE-2014-1791 is a critical vulnerability that could allow remote code execution through memory corruption in Internet Explorer. The attack vector is web-based, requiring the attacker to trick the victim into visiting a malicious website.
