## Security Update for Internet Explorer (2965111)

Published: May 1, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using an affected version of Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry later in this bulletin.

This security update addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983).

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For Customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows/turn-automatic-updating-on-off) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

| Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1 | For the 2964444 update: [MS14-012](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=392064) (note that MS14-018 was not a cumulative update for Internet Explorer 11)\ \ For the 2964358 update: [2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355) |

**If I applied a workaround described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983, do I need to undo the workaround before applying this update?**
It depends on which workaround was applied. Consult the list below:

* If you applied the workaround to **modify the Access Control List (ACL) on VGX.DLL**, then you must undo this workaround before applying this security update. To undo this workaround, from an elevated command prompt, run the following command:

  ```
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /g original ACLs

  ```

  where *original ACLs* are the original user access rights before the workaround was applied. Alternatively, the access to vgx.dll could be set to everyone using the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /E /R everyone

  ```

  You should repeat the above for "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" on 64-bit systems. Also note that if icacls was used instead of cacls to apply the workaround, then use icacls to restore the original ACLs.

  For example, these commands for icacls could be run from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /restore %TEMP%\VGX_ACL.TXT

  ```

  where *VGX\_ACL.TXT* is the backup file created to save the original user access rights when the workaround was applied using icacls.

  You should repeat the above for "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" on 64-bit systems.
* If you applied the workaround to **unregister VGX.DLL**, you do not have to undo this workaround before applying the security update. However, the security update will not re-register vgx.dll. See the **Workarounds** section for the vulnerability for steps on how to re-register vgx.dll.

  **Note** For users running 64-bit systems who applied the original **unregister VGX.DLL** workaround documented in version 1.0 of Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983, please apply the updated workaround as described in this security bulletin for 64-bit systems.
* If you applied any of the other workarounds from [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983), you do not have to undo the workaround before applying the security update.

**How are Server Core installations affected by the vulnerability addressed in this bulletin?**

The vulnerability addressed by this update do not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2 as indicated in the Non-Applicable Software table, when installed using the Server Core installation option.

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, the modern, immersive browsing experience on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 runs with [Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=257809). For example, customers using the touch-friendly Internet Explorer 11 browser on modern Windows tablets are using Enhanced Protected Mode by default. Enhanced Protected Mode uses advanced security protections that can help mitigate against exploitation of this vulnerability on 64-bit systems. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Enhanced Protected Mode.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Unregister VGX.DLL**

  **For 32-bit Windows systems**

  **Note** The following command must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  1. From an elevated command prompt, enter the following command:

     ```
     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     ```

     A dialog box should appear after the command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow this command to be scripted.
  2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.

  **For 64-bit Windows systems**

  **Note** For users running 64-bit systems who applied the original **unregister VGX.DLL** workaround documented in version 1.0 of [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983), please apply the updated workaround as described below for 64-bit systems.

  **Note** The following commands must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  1. From an elevated command prompt, enter the following commands:

     ```
     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     ```

     A dialog box should appear after each command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow these commands to be scripted.
  2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround.** Applications that render VML will no longer do so once vgx.dll has been unregistered. Also note that software that redistributes vgx.dll may fail to install after vgx.dll is unregistered. This workaround may need to be reverted before the software can be installed.

  **How to undo this workaround**. The security update does not re-register vgx.dll. To re-register vgx.dll follow these steps:

  **Note** The following commands must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  For 32-bit Windows systems, from an elevated command prompt, enter the following command:

  ```
  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  ```

  A dialog box should appear after the command is run to confirm that the re-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow this command to be scripted.

  For 64-bit Windows systems, from an elevated command prompt, enter the following commands:

  ```
  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  ```

  A dialog box should appear after each command is run to confirm that the re-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow these commands to be scripted.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  \*\* \*\*

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET 4.x help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes, EMET 4.0 and EMET 4.1 help to mitigate this issue. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

**Note** EMET 3.0 does not mitigate this issue.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**Does Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. For Internet Explorer 10 and Internet Explorer 11, enabling Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode helps mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability on 64-bit systems. Enhanced Protected Mode does not mitigate against this vulnerability on 32-bit systems because the 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode feature is not available.

**Note** Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled by default for the modern, immersive browser. For Internet Explorer on the Desktop, EPM must be enabled manually.

For Internet Explorer 10 on the Desktop running on Windows 7 for x64-based systems and Windows 8 for x64-based systems, you must enable **Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)**. When you enable EPM on these operating systems, **64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode** is also enabled. There is no separate option to turn this feature on or off in Internet Explorer 10.

For Internet Explorer 11 on the Desktop running on Windows 7 for x64-based systems and Windows 8.1 for x64-based systems, you must enable both **Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)** and **64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode** separately.

Note that after you enable Enhanced Protected Mode, incompatible add-ons will automatically be disabled. If you encounter a site that needs a disabled add-on in order to work, you can disable Enhanced Protected Mode just for that particular website. If you disable Enhanced Protected Mode for a website, any protections that EPM would provide will not apply when visiting the website. For more information about EPM, see [Enhanced Protected Mode on desktop IE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/dn265025).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

## Security Update for Internet Explorer (2965111)

Published: May 1, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using an affected version of Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry later in this bulletin.

This security update addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983).

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For Customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows/turn-automatic-updating-on-off) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

| Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1 | For the 2964444 update: [MS14-012](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=392064) (note that MS14-018 was not a cumulative update for Internet Explorer 11)\ \ For the 2964358 update: [2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355) |

**If I applied a workaround described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983, do I need to undo the workaround before applying this update?**
It depends on which workaround was applied. Consult the list below:

* If you applied the workaround to **modify the Access Control List (ACL) on VGX.DLL**, then you must undo this workaround before applying this security update. To undo this workaround, from an elevated command prompt, run the following command:

  ```
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /g original ACLs

  ```

  where *original ACLs* are the original user access rights before the workaround was applied. Alternatively, the access to vgx.dll could be set to everyone using the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  echo y| cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /E /R everyone

  ```

  You should repeat the above for "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" on 64-bit systems. Also note that if icacls was used instead of cacls to apply the workaround, then use icacls to restore the original ACLs.

  For example, these commands for icacls could be run from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /grant everyone:(F)
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" /restore %TEMP%\VGX_ACL.TXT

  ```

  where *VGX\_ACL.TXT* is the backup file created to save the original user access rights when the workaround was applied using icacls.

  You should repeat the above for "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll" on 64-bit systems.
* If you applied the workaround to **unregister VGX.DLL**, you do not have to undo this workaround before applying the security update. However, the security update will not re-register vgx.dll. See the **Workarounds** section for the vulnerability for steps on how to re-register vgx.dll.

  **Note** For users running 64-bit systems who applied the original **unregister VGX.DLL** workaround documented in version 1.0 of Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983, please apply the updated workaround as described in this security bulletin for 64-bit systems.
* If you applied any of the other workarounds from [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983), you do not have to undo the workaround before applying the security update.

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, the modern, immersive browsing experience on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 runs with [Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=257809). For example, customers using the touch-friendly Internet Explorer 11 browser on modern Windows tablets are using Enhanced Protected Mode by default. Enhanced Protected Mode uses advanced security protections that can help mitigate against exploitation of this vulnerability on 64-bit systems. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Enhanced Protected Mode.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Unregister VGX.DLL**

  **For 32-bit Windows systems**

  **Note** The following command must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  1. From an elevated command prompt, enter the following command:

     ```
     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     ```

     A dialog box should appear after the command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow this command to be scripted.
  2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.

  **For 64-bit Windows systems**

  **Note** For users running 64-bit systems who applied the original **unregister VGX.DLL** workaround documented in version 1.0 of [Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2963983), please apply the updated workaround as described below for 64-bit systems.

  **Note** The following commands must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  1. From an elevated command prompt, enter the following commands:

     ```
     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

     ```

     A dialog box should appear after each command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow these commands to be scripted.
  2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround.** Applications that render VML will no longer do so once vgx.dll has been unregistered. Also note that software that redistributes vgx.dll may fail to install after vgx.dll is unregistered. This workaround may need to be reverted before the software can be installed.

  **How to undo this workaround**. The security update does not re-register vgx.dll. To re-register vgx.dll follow these steps:

  **Note** The following commands must be entered from an elevated command prompt.

  For 32-bit Windows systems, from an elevated command prompt, enter the following command:

  ```
  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  ```

  A dialog box should appear after the command is run to confirm that the re-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow this command to be scripted.

  For 64-bit Windows systems, from an elevated command prompt, enter the following commands:

  ```
  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"

  ```

  A dialog box should appear after each command is run to confirm that the re-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect. Note that the **-s** command line switch can be used to suppress the dialog box in order to allow these commands to be scripted.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET 4.x help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes, EMET 4.0 and EMET 4.1 help to mitigate this issue. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

**Note** EMET 3.0 does not mitigate this issue.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**Does Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. For Internet Explorer 10 and Internet Explorer 11, enabling Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode helps mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability on 64-bit systems. Enhanced Protected Mode does not mitigate against this vulnerability on 32-bit systems because the 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode feature is not available.

**Note** Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled by default for the modern, immersive browser. For Internet Explorer on the Desktop, EPM must be enabled manually.

For Internet Explorer 10 on the Desktop running on Windows 7 for x64-based systems and Windows 8 for x64-based systems, you must enable **Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)**. When you enable EPM on these operating systems, **64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode** is also enabled. There is no separate option to turn this feature on or off in Internet Explorer 10.

For Internet Explorer 11 on the Desktop running on Windows 7 for x64-based systems and Windows 8.1 for x64-based systems, you must enable both **Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM)** and **64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode** separately.

Note that after you enable Enhanced Protected Mode, incompatible add-ons will automatically be disabled. If you encounter a site that needs a disabled add-on in order to work, you can disable Enhanced Protected Mode just for that particular website. If you disable Enhanced Protected Mode for a website, any protections that EPM would provide will not apply when visiting the website. For more information about EPM, see [Enhanced Protected Mode on desktop IE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/dn265025).

[CVE-2014-1776 (IE 0day) Analysis](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/cve-2014-1776-ie-0day-analysis/)
Posted on May 1st, 2014

FireEye Research Labs identified a new Internet Explorer zero-day exploit used in targeted attacks.  The vulnerability nearly affects  all Internet Explorer versions (6/7/8/9/10/11).  The exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP.  CVE-2014-1776  was assigned to the vulnerability by Microsoft.

There is not any public PoC / Exploit of the vulnerability on web.  So we will not share it too.

**Vulnerability and Analysis**

Firstly,  Websense’s claim is not truth, the vulnerability is not a buffer overflow. This is exactly a use after free. The vulnerability exists within the object used by MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup+0x6. Exploit  forces to re-use a dangling pointer of the object and this causes use-after-free error.

Here is the crash point when we trigger the vulnerability with PoC.html. Crash occurs on MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup+0x6 function. The function tries to “mov” an object that ESI points.

[![crash](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crash1.png)](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/crash1.png)

After running !heap command  for a quick analysis,   we see that ESI points to an object which has been already free-ed:

[![free-ed](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/free-ed.png)](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/free-ed.png)

The object  is free-ed by  MSHTML!Cmarkup::PrivateRelease function as we see in heap trace. If we look at these functions , we will see that it calls HeapFree function:

[![heapfree](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/heapfree.png)](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/heapfree.png)

And this  free-ed  object  re-used by  MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup+0x6 and this causes the use after free condition.

**Exploitation**

Exploit uses Flash vector object technique to bypass ASLR and DEP successfully. This is a common technique which used by fresh exploits nowadays.  Exploit loads a flash file (SWF) before triggering the vulnerability and prepare the heap with this technique.

To exploit use after free vulns, firstly we should know what size of object allocated before it becomes free-ed ? If we can create a fake object with same size using heap spray, then it’s possible to exploit this vulnerability. So I looked the crash function and wanted to follow where ESI comes from etc.

[![disasm](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/disasm.png)](http://www.signalsec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/disasm.png)

So I put a breakpoint on MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup  and want to look at the heap allocations until it crashes.

Here is the windbg command that I use;

BP MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup “!heap -p -a esi; g”

and this is the result of windbg until it crashes:

60e15956 8b86a4000000 mov eax,dword ptr [esi+0A4h] ds:002b:21be4c7c=????????

[/code]

So the object size is 0x428 and we should create a fake object with this size using heap spray technique to exploit this vulnerability.

**Solution**

Actually VML is the not the root cause of the vulnerability so unregistering VGX.DLL  will only block the current exploit in the wild.

We are working with [ZEMANA](http://www.zemana.com) to release a 3rd party patch for this vulnerability soon. We will update you about the patch soon.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer CMarkup use-after-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#222929

Original Release Date: 2014-04-27 | Last Revised: 2014-05-07

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a use-after-free vulnerability, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a use-after-free vulnerability. This can allow for arbitrary code execution. Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 are affected.  Note that this vulnerability is being [exploited in the wild](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/uncategorized/2014/04/new-zero-day-exploit-targeting-internet-explorer-versions-9-through-11-identified-in-targeted-attacks.html). Although no Adobe Flash vulnerability appears to be at play here, the Internet Explorer vulnerability is used to corrupt Flash content in a way that allows ASLR to be bypassed via a memory address leak. This is made possible with Internet Explorer because Flash runs within the same process space as the browser. Note that exploitation without the use of Flash may be possible. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in the update for [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-021](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-021). This update is available via Windows Update. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will.**Unregister VGX.DLL**Microsoft provides guidance to unregister VGX.DLL:   **For 32-bit Windows systems** **Important**: For this workaround to take effect, you MUST run it from an elevated command prompt.1. From an elevated command prompt enter the following command: "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"  A dialog box should appear after the command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect..    **For 64-bit Windows systems**  **Note** The following commands must be entered from an elevated command prompt.1. From an elevated command prompt enter the following commands: "%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll""%SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe" -u "%CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Shared\VGX\vgx.dll"  A dialog box should appear after each command is run to confirm that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.2. Close and reopen Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.  **Impact of Workaround**: Applications that render VML will no longer do so once vgx.dll has been unregistered.  Note that the vulnerability does not reside in VGX.DLL. This library is used in current exploits, so unregistering it will prevent those specific exploits from working, rather than blocking access to the vulnerability. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
