{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. Specifically, it involves a dangling pointer within the object used by MSHTML!CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup+0x6, which, when re-used, causes a use-after-free error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution with the same privileges as the current user. An attacker could potentially take complete control of the affected system if the current user has administrative rights, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: Attacker hosts a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability through Internet Explorer, then convinces user to view it (e.g., via email or IM link)",
        "Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content/ads may contain the exploit"

    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject the malicious content into a web page and convince a user to visit the page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11.",
      "Exploitation can involve techniques such as Flash vector object to bypass ASLR/DEP.",
      "The vulnerability is triggered by re-using a dangling pointer after the associated memory has been freed."
