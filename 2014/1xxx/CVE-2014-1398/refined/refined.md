```
Root cause of vulnerability: The entity module's access API in Drupal does not sufficiently protect comment, user, and node statistics properties from unauthorized access.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    -  Insufficient protection of comment, user and node statistics properties from unprivileged user access via the entity wrapper access API.
    - The module's entity wrapper access API does not properly check entity access on referenced entities such as taxonomy terms.
    - The entity_access() API does not protect unpublished comments from being viewed by unprivileged users.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to data by exploiting these access bypass vulnerabilities.
Attack vectors:
    -  Exploiting the entity wrapper access API to access comment, user or node statistics properties
    -  Exploiting the access() method of entity metadata wrappers to access properties that reference multiple entities that the attacker does not have access to.
    - Accessing unpublished comments using the entity_access API.
Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - An attacker needs a way to interact with the entity module via an API or other means to exploit the vulnerability.
    - For the first vulnerability to be exploitable, a module needs to be enabled that relies on the Entity property access API and it must be configured to expose either comment, user or node statistics properties. For example, the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS) with permissions to access these resources.
    - For the second vulnerability, an attacker would need a module that uses the access() method of entity metadata wrappers, such as the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS). This module would need to be configured to permit access to entity properties or entity reference fields (such as a list of unaccessible user entities on a node entity).
   - For the third vulnerability, a module using the entity access API on comments needs to be enabled, as well as the comment module itself.
