| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1050802#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 06:14:05 UTC  ``` The entity module for Drupal was recently reported to be affected by multiple access bypass vulnerabilites, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the data.  1) Comment, User and Node Statistics property access bypass  The module's entity wrapper access API doesn't sufficiently protect comment, user and node statistics properties from unprivileged user access. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a module must be enabled that relies on the Entity property access API and it must be configured to expose either comment, user or node statistics properties. One example would be the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS) with the permission configured to access the comment, user or node resource for untrusted web service consumers.  2) Entity list property access bypass  The module's entity wrapper access API doesn't sufficiently check entity access on referenced entities such as taxonomy terms. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a module must be enabled that uses the access() method of entity metadata wrappers to determine access to a property which references multiple entities to which access is not granted. One example would be the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS) with respectively configured permissions on an entity property or (entity reference) field, for example a list of (unaccessible) referenced user entities on a node entity.  3) Unpublished comments access bypass  The module's entity_access() API doesn't protect unpublished comments from being viewed by unprivileged users. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact a module must be enabled which uses the provided entity access API on comments and the comment module must be enabled.  The issues are said to be fixed in drupal7-entity-1.3.
