Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1586:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents contain information about CVE-2014-1586. The official description from MITRE and SUSE states:

> "The WebRTC video-sharing feature in dom/media/MediaManager.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 does not properly recognize Stop Sharing actions for videos in IFRAME elements, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from the local camera by maintaining a session after the user tries to discontinue streaming."

Several documents confirm this CVE ID and describe the same vulnerability affecting the same products.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "Stop Sharing" action when using WebRTC video sharing within IFRAME elements. Specifically, the `nsDocument.cpp` component fails to recognize when a user tries to discontinue video streaming in this context. This leads to a lack of proper termination of the video sharing session, even when the user navigates away or tries to stop.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent state management:** The core issue is the lack of synchronization between the user's intention to stop sharing and the actual termination of the WebRTC session, particularly within iframes.
*  **Lack of proper cleanup:** The video stream is not properly terminated when user navigates away from the iframe or stops sharing.
*   **Information Exposure:** Because the video stream can continue without the user's knowledge, this exposes the user's camera to the remote attacker

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** The primary impact is the potential for unauthorized access to the user's camera feed. An attacker could potentially maintain a video feed after the user believes they have stopped sharing.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker may be able to capture video feed from user's camera.
*   **Potential for long term exposure:** The camera feed can remain active and accessible as long as the vulnerable iframe is open or the user navigates back to the original page

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious webpage that embeds a vulnerable IFRAME which initiates WebRTC video sharing.
*   **Compromised Website:** An attacker could inject the malicious IFRAME into a legitimate, but vulnerable website.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote position.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice a user to visit a specially crafted or compromised webpage containing the malicious iframe.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey.
*   The fix involves updating to specific versions of these applications (Firefox 33, Firefox ESR 31.2, Thunderbird 31.2, SeaMonkey 2.30).
*   The vulnerability is considered a "moderate" to "important" security issue by different vendors.
*   The fix disables bfcache for pages with active gUM.
