Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Mediawiki 1.18.0 handles file names containing an asterisk (`*`) during thumbnail creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  When a user uploads a file (e.g., an image) with a name containing an asterisk, the subsequent thumbnail creation process reveals the web server's file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the web server's internal file path, which can aid in further reconnaissance and potential exploitation.
- The original report notes that remote shell code execution was not achieved, but suggests it may be a possible attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by uploading a file with a filename containing an asterisk (`*`). This happens during thumbnail generation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to upload files to the Mediawiki instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by backporting a patch to versions 1.19 and 1.20 that prevents the creation of files with names containing an asterisk.
- Improper permissions during thumbnail creation might also lead to similar information disclosure issues.
- The provided content does not specify how the path information is revealed.
