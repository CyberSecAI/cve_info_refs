Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1740:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free in the WebSockets implementation of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the vulnerable software.
- Denial of service: Exploiting the vulnerability could cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, likely by sending crafted WebSocket messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted websocket messages to the vulnerable application (Chromium).
- No special access or privileges are needed beyond the ability to send network requests.
