Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from SoapUI's ability to execute arbitrary Java code embedded within a specific tag: `${=JAVA CODE};`. This functionality, intended for dynamic property generation, was exploitable by attackers by injecting malicious Java code into WSDL/WADL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The core vulnerability is a code injection flaw, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Java code on the victim's machine.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** SoapUI fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied data in WSDL/WADL files, specifically within the `${=...}` tag. This lack of validation permits the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary Java code execution on the victim's machine, granting the attacker significant control over the system.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially take over the victim's machine, leading to data breaches, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact compromises all three aspects of the CIA triad.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WSDL/WADL Files:** Attackers craft malicious WSDL/WADL files containing the Java code payload embedded within the default value of parameters.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must import the malicious WSDL/WADL file into SoapUI and then attempt to send a request to the server for the exploit to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Modify WSDL/WADL Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify WSDL/WADL files and inject malicious java code.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into importing and using the malicious WSDL/WADL file in SoapUI.

**Additional Technical Details from Content:**
- The exploit is triggered when SoapUI attempts to resolve the default parameter value, causing it to execute the embedded java code.
- The provided exploit code example uses `Runtime.getRuntime().exec('calc.exe')` which will execute the calculator application as a proof of concept.
- The vulnerability was confirmed to be present in SoapUI version 4.6.3 and is fixed in version 4.6.4.
- The vulnerable tag `${=JAVA CODE};` was used for dynamic properties and contained arbitrary Java code.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and the steps needed to exploit it.
