#### Released 2017-11-29 ####
### Overall Improvements ###
\* SoapUI 5.4 uses Apache Commons Collections library version 3.2.2 that fixes a security vulnerability.
\* SoapUI now supports Java 1.8.
\* An improvement by DonnyDepp: The window borders are now thicker, so it is easier to resize windows by dragging their borders.
### Bug Fixes ###
\* A bug fix by vimil: When a response returned redirect status codes, SoapUI always simulated a GET request to the new address. Now, if the initial request uses the POST method, SoapUI simulates a POST request.
### Discontinued Support ###
\* LoadUI integration has been removed from SoapUI. To integrate your functional tests with LoadUI, use ReadyAPI. Learn more about LoadUI in ReadyAPI at https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/loadui/overview/.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SoapUI Open Source 5.3.0
#### Released 2016-11-30 ####
### Improvements ###
\* Support for OAuth 1 authentication. (SOAPUIOS-194)
\* Improved support for OAuth 2. SoapUI now supports two additional grant types: Resource Owner Password Credentials and Client Credentials. (SOAPUIOS-60)
\* A new feature by Krzysztof Baranski (krzysbaranski in GitHub): Support for Server Name Indication (SNI) in TLS/SSL requests. (SOAPUIOS-218)
\* A new feature by Bouke Nijhuis (BoukeNijhuis in GitHub): The XQuery Match assertion now supports the "Ignore namespace prefix" and "Ignore XML Comments" options. (SOAPUIOS-210)
\* A new feature by Kyle Smith (smithk86 in GitHub): The Set Endpoint dialog now displays endpoints in alphabetical order. (SOAPUIOS-212)
Many thanks to Krzysztof, Bouke and Kyle for their efforts!
\* The design of some buttons has been updated. (SOAPUIOS-209)
\* The SoapUI icon on Mac OS X has been updated. (SOAPUIOS-90)
### Bundled Plugin ###
\* The Postman plugin is now included in the SoapUI installation package. You use this plugin to import Postman collections and tests to SoapUI. (SOAPUIOS-208)
### Bug Fixes ###
\* TestRunner displayed the "Usage statistics" dialog upon starting. To close this dialog, you had to click any button in it, which was inconvenient for automated test runs. (SOAPUIOS-188)
\* The JDBC Request test step converted all SQL column names in responses to upper case. This could cause issues when comparing the response contents with baseline data. (SOAPUIOS-190)
\* The SLA assertion did not support property expansions. (SOAPUIOS-195)
\* It was impossible to send requests to a secured web service through a proxy server. The simulated requests did not contain the proxy user credentials. (SOAPUIOS-196, SOAPUIOS-199)
\* The Groovy Script assertion called by the JDBC Request test step always returned an error "null". (SOAPUIOS-200)
\* The context menu of the XML editor had duplicated "Select All" items. (SOAPUIOS-201)
\* The Properties test step failed to load the properties, whose names ended with a backslash (\), from a file. (SOAPUIOS-202)
\* A NoSuchMethodException exception could occur when creating a project from WSDL. (SOAPUIOS-204)
\* A bug fix by Bouke Nijhuis (BoukeNijhuis in GitHub): In certain cases, the Recently Used tab could disappear from the Assertions dialog. (SOAPUIOS-211).
\* A bug fix by bearsoftware (GitHub nickname): The Request URL property of the HTTP Request test step did not allow capital letters. (SOAPUIOS-213)
\* A bug fix by kekemonster (GitHub nickname): Multiple concurrent requests to a mock service could cause the HTTP 500 error. (SOAPUIOS-215)
Many thanks to Bouke Nijhuis, bearsoftware and kekemonster for contribution!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SoapUI Open Source 5.2.1
#### Released 2015-10-02 ####
\* A new bundled SwaggerHub plugin that helps you easily import Swagger API definitions from SwaggerHub to your project and to export your APIs to SwaggerHub. (SOAPUIOS-152) For information on SwaggerHub, see http://smartbear.com/product/swaggerhub/overview/. More information on the plugin is available at https://github.com/SmartBear/readyapi-swaggerhub-plugin.
\* More efficient memory usage. (SOAPUIOS-154)
\* A new feature by Stanislaw Wozniak (a GitHub user with the nickname sponte): The test runner has a new setting that commands SoapUI to export test case properties to JUnit-style reports. You can find the new “Export JUnit Results with test properties” check box on the Reports tab of the dialog, in which you specify the test runner's properties before the run. To enable this functionality from the command line, use the new -J command-line argument. (SOAPUIOS-156)
\* A bug fix by Marc Paquette (marcpa00 in GitHub): Earlier versions of SoapUI doubled messages sent to the console log from Groovy code. Marc has fixed this. (SOAPUIOS-157)
Many thanks to Stanislaw and Marc for their efforts!
\* More bug fixes: - The UXM AlertSite plugin did not add the "Monitor APIs" item to the product’s menu. (SOAPUIOS-166) - An error ("Access mode for wsi-test-tools scripts couldn't be set") could occur when installing the product on Linux. (SOAPUIOS-161) - Running WS-I Compliance for a SOAP service could cause an exception. (SOAPUIOS-158)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SoapUI Open Source 5.2
#### Released 2015-07-02 ####
### Major New Features ###
\* You can use 4 new JSONPath-based assertions: - JsonPath Count - Calculates the number of element occurrences in a JSON response. - JsonPath Existence Match - Extracts data from a JSON response and compares it with an expected value. - JsonPath Match - Checks if a JSON response contains specific node. - JsonPath RegEx Match - Extracts data from a JSON response and verifies it with a regular expression. You can find the new assertions in the Add Assertions dialog, in the Property Content assertion group.\* You can create new empty projects (in earlier versions, projects had to be based on WSDL or WADL, or URI).
### Improvements ###
\* New look inspired by ReadyAPI.\* Support for Java 6 has been dropped.  To run SoapUI, now you need to have Java 7 on your computer. The SoapUI installation package includes Java 7 modules,  so if you use the installer, you do not have to download and install additional files.\* Old-style icons have been replaced with newer icons.
### Bundled Plugins ###
The SoapUI installation package includes the following plugins:\* MQTT plugin - Enables IOT testing of MQTT services.\* Swagger plugin - Enables loading and saving of Swagger interface descriptions.\* AlertSite UXM plugin - Enables distributed monitoring of APIs.
### Bugs Fixed ###
\* The JMS Timeout assertion did not work.\* SoapUI failed to find attachments specified by 'xop:Include href'.\* SoapUI failed to load plugins when you run tests with testrunner.bat and the current directory differed from <SoapUI>\bin.\* The "Help > Privacy Policy" menu item did not open any web page. Now it opens http://www.soapui.org/Store-Info/privacy-policy.html.\* In the Property Transfer test step editor, it was possible to add two items with the same name to the Transfers list.\* When you resized the "Contain" assertion edit window, the text in that window did not resize appropriately.\* The Overview tab of the REST Interface editor displayed "WSDL Definition" instead of "WADL Definition".\* There was a misprint in the SoapUI Preferences > WSDL Settings screen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exploit Title: SoapUI Remote Code Execution
# Date: 25.12.13

# Version: vulnerable before 4.6.4
# Tested on: Windows, should work at Linux as well
# CVE : CVE-2014-1202

I have been found remote code execution vulnerability in the SoapUI product,
which allows me to execute a java code to the victim's computer via
malicious WSDL/WADL file.

This vulnerability allows attacker to execute java code to any client's
machine that will use my WSDL file and will try to send request to the
remote server.

SoapUI allows the client execute code by entering a java code inside the
following tag, the java code will be executed when the client will try to
send request to the server:

${=JAVA CODE};

Thus, an attacker can make a malicious WSDL file, determine a malicious java
code as default value in one of the requests parameters, hence, when client
uses  malicious WSDL file and will try to send a request the java code will
be executed.

The attack flow is:

1.       The attacker makes a malicious web service with fake WSDL including
the java payload that will be executed on the victim.

2.       The victim enters the soapUI program and will enter the malicious
WSDL address.

3.       The victim decides to send a request to the server, and the java
code executed on the victim's machine.

4.       The attacker succeed execute java code in the victim's machine, and
will take over it.

This vulnerability was check on the version (4.6.3), a proof of concept

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### SoapUI Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1202

In this blog post I will
discuss a vulnerability I’ve found in the SoapUI product before version 4.6.4
([CVE-2014-1202](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1202)).
I discovered this vulnerability
during a penetration test in which I saw that the SoapUI software allows the
clients to execute a Java code on the local machine by putting a Java code
inside the following tag:

${=***JAVA CODE***};

The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute the java code on the victim's
machine, thereby putting in danger the SoapUI users, including developers,
penetration testers, etc.

The SoapUI product allows users
to open a SOAP / REST project and import  WSDL/WADL files that help the users to
communicate with the remote server easily.
WSDL/WADL files are XML-based
grammar that define the operations that a web service offers and the format of
the request and response messages that the client sends to and receives from
the operations.
In WSDL/WADL files, the file
owner can determine the default values of some parameters. Thus, an attacker
can impersonate a legitimate web service and inject a malicious Java code into
a default value of one of the parameters, and spread it to SoapUI clients.
When a SoapUI client will load
a malicious WSDL/WADL file to his project in the SoapUI software, and send a
request containing the malicious Java code, the SoapUI will execute the
malicious Java code on the victim's computer.

The attack scenario:
1. An attacker impersonates a regular web service with a malicious
WSDL containing the malicious Java code.
2. The victim creates a new project in the SoapUI and loads the
malicious WSDL.
3. The victim decides to send a request to the remote server,
thus, the SoapUI executes the malicious Java code.
4. The attacker succeeds in executing malicious code in the
victim's machine and will take it over.

A Proof of Concept (PoC) video
can be found at the following link:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lCLE64rsc0>

An example of a malicious WSDL
file can be found at the following link:

     Thanks.
     The software allows the clients generate random numbers for dynamic properties and i noticed that its actually a Java code.
     The Java code executes when the client sends the request to the server.

   AFRICAN TRADITIONAL METHODS OF CURING HERPES THAT IS GOING VIRAL!
   Most traditional methods of roots and herbs today have been scientifically proven to cure almost all drugs resistant diseases without after effect.
   It worked for me years ago when I was depressed with herpes. After trying numerous other methods, It was actually an old Ibo lady who brought to my notice the healing effect of natural medicines. She too was permanently cured from HERPES long time ago through Dr Utu @ "drutuherbalcure@gmail.com" who among few, specialises in African roots and herbs for medicinal cure. Apparently roots and herbs have well been known as effective key treatment for herpes. She introduced me to Dr Utu who till date remain my savior, and he truly cleared my doubt. After taking his medication on the fourth week, I contacted him again who asked me to go for test and I was negative. From then till now I do my normal business no outbreak. I may not be a herbal fan but it definitely worked for me!

    HOW I GOT CURED OF HERPES DISEASE.
    I'm here to testify about what DR. OSO did for me. I have been suffering from (HERPES) disease for the past 5 years and had constant pain,especially inside my body. During the first year,I had faith in God that I would be healed someday. This disease started circulating all over my body and I have been taking treatment from my doctor, few weeks ago I came across a testimony of one lady on the internet testifying about a Man called DR. OSO on how he cured her from herpes disease. And she also gave the email address of this man and advised anybody to contact him for help for any kind of sickness that he would be of help.so I emailed him telling him about my (HERPES) he told me not to worry that i was going to be cured!! Well I never believed it,, well after all the procedures and remedies given to me by this man few weeks later i started experiencing changes all over me as DR. OSO assured me that I will be cured,after some time. I went to my doctor to confirm if I had finally healed Behold, it was TRUE,the test came out negative. So friends my advice is if you have such sickness or any other at all you can contact DR. OSO for help.

    My health was horrible before I decided to try the Protocol Of taking Dr. Omola pure herbal mixture. I felt there was no hope for my health and I was to try the Protocol, thinking it wouldn’t work because I have visited so many hospital but same result. However, I was convinced by a Instagram friend to try the herbal medicine because I wanted to get rid of Herpes virus. The herbal mixture that was given to me was really quick and easy to take, within 2 week I was fully cured from Herpes.

    Thanks to Dr IYERE
    who cured me of Herpes virus. I noticed a strange changes in my body, and I visited a doctor who diagnosed me of Herpes so I was terrified emotionally and looking  for every possible cure to the virus, as I was going through online I came across Dr. Iyere profile, that was how I contacted him and we made an arrangement how to get the Herbs, and he administered his herb on me, and I became fully healthy under two week, in case you want to contact Dr IYERE for a similar problem, you can reach him through his email: driyereherbalhome@gmail.com or WhatsApp him:+2348106427180

    My name is Thomas White, from United states, i have been Herpes positive and it is just like been through hell; well special thanks to God almighty for using Dr Twaha, the greatest Herbal doctor in curing my herpes disease. I was diagnosed of this disease in the year 2004. Although I was taking my medications I was not myself. Until a few weeks ago. My friend came to me and told me that he saw many testimonies on how Dr. Twaha  cured people Herpes disease. Although I never believe in herbs, I said to myself "seeing is believing" I took his name and searched it on GOOGLE, I saw many testimonies myself. Quickly, I copied his email: drlregbeyen10000@gmail.com I emailed him, he gave me a form to fill which I did, then he sent me a message  and told me that he required some items in which he will use in preparing the cure for me and he told me that it will cost me some money which i sent to him because I need the cure urgent,  He bought the items and prepared a cure for me, then he sent the parcel to me through courier delivery service. I paid the courier services, I got my parcel, it was a bottle of ointment as described by Dr,Twaha After taking the ointment he told me to do, the herpes test and the result came out negative. Quickly I messaged him and told him what happened he congratulated me. I promised to tell the world about him. You can contact him with any problem  via email: ( drlregbeyen10000@gmail.com ) or contact him on WhatsApp +2349038518881 thank you Dr Twaha

    Hello everyone. Recently, I needed to write an online essay. But I didn't get my hands on it, I constantly don't have time or I'm just too lazy to do it. And my friend recommended this site to me, where they helped me [take my online class for me](https://myexamcoach.com/take-my-online-class/). I really liked the work of the staff, for a small fee, surprisingly everything was done quickly and efficiently. I will continue to use their service and I recommend it to you!

    Herpes is a serious and recurring disease which can't be cured through drugs or injections by the American doctors but the best way to deal with Herpes is by taking natural herbs medicine for it, I have read about DR EDAGHONGHON the great herbalist doctor who cure me from herpes with his powerful herbal medicine.
