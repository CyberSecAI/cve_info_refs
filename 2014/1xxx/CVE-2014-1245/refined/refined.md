Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1245:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A signedness issue existed in the handling of 'stsz' atoms within QuickTime.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Signedness issue. This likely means that a value that was intended to be treated as unsigned was treated as a signed value, or vice-versa, leading to incorrect size calculations.
- This can result in a buffer overflow if the calculated size is too large.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Playing a maliciously crafted movie file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by playing a maliciously crafted movie file containing a malformed 'stsz' atom.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a movie file with the specific malicious 'stsz' atom.
- The victim needs to play the maliciously crafted movie file with a vulnerable version of QuickTime.
- No special network position or access to the victim's system is required beyond the ability to deliver the crafted movie file.
