      "cve": "CVE-2014-1803",
      "content": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, which could lead to memory corruption and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
      "root_cause": "Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Memory corruption vulnerability"

      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious file through social engineering."
