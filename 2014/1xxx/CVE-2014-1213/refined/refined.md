**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing ACLs on named system objects.
- Unrestricted access to global and session objects related to Sophos Anti-Virus.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By manipulating these objects, an attacker can potentially disrupt the normal operation of Sophos Anti-Virus, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local access on the machine where Sophos Anti-Virus is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a user account on the target system where Sophos Anti-Virus is running. Any user on the system can potentially exploit this issue.
