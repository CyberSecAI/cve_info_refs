The provided content relates to CVE-2014-1238.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when handling the "LookupListType" GET parameter in the Q-Pulse application. Specifically, the application directly inserts this parameter's value into a JavaScript variable named `$RootTree` without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into opening a specially crafted link. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within the browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A malicious URL containing a crafted `LookupListType` parameter is used. The example provided is: `http://[host]/qpulse5web/ui/common/managedlistdialog.aspx/LookupListType=DocumentTypeLookupList%27%0A%0Aalert(123);//`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to click on this link, since the attack requires an active session.
