Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Mozilla Firefox, where XSLT stylesheets were incorrectly treated as styles instead of scripts. This classification error meant that `style-src` directives, which are generally less restrictive than `script-src`, were applied to XSLT stylesheets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect Content Security Policy (CSP) enforcement: XSLT stylesheets, which can execute scripts, were incorrectly categorized as "styles" by CSP.
- Potential for unexpected script execution: Because XSLT stylesheets were not subjected to the stricter `script-src` directives, they could potentially execute scripts that would otherwise be blocked by a proper CSP.
- Deviation from W3C Specification: The implementation was not compliant with the CSP specification, which requires XSLT to be controlled by `script-src`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass CSP restrictions and execute arbitrary scripts by including them in a specially crafted XSLT stylesheet.  The attacker could exploit the lax style-src permissions allowing the execution of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker crafts a malicious webpage or email containing a link to a specially crafted XSLT stylesheet.
- Victim visits the webpage or opens the email and loads the malicious XSLT.
- If the CSP of the webpage allows the malicious XSLT from the style-src directive, the script within the stylesheet could execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host or inject a malicious XSLT stylesheet on a site or deliver via email.
- The attacker must entice a user to load the stylesheet within a vulnerable browser.
- The vulnerable browser must have a Content Security Policy that is more permissive to `style-src` than `script-src`, allowing the attacker's malicious XSLT stylesheet to load.
