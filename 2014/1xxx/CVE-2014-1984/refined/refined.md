Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a session fixation issue in Cybozu Remote Service Manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability, where the application does not properly invalidate or regenerate session identifiers, allowing an attacker to use a known session ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can impersonate a registered user.
- This impersonation can lead to the disclosure or alteration of information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can use the pre-existing valid session ID to impersonate a victim user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs a valid session ID that can be used for impersonation.
