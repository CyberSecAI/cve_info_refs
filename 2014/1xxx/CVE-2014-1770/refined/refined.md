  "CVE-2014-1770": {
    "description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 contains a use-after-free vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in how CMarkup objects are handled in Internet Explorer 8.  Specifically, the allocation of a CMarkup object happens within CMarkup::CreateInitialMarkup. The free occurs after the execution of certain JavaScript code, followed by a CollectGarbage call. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By convincing a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file (e.g., HTML email message/attachment), an attacker can trigger the vulnerability."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted HTML document or control a compromised website that hosts such a document. User interaction is required to open the malicious content."
