### Hi there!

Do you like our free content? Enjoying the materials we put together?

Are you interested in learning how to write exploits for Windows, but perhaps looking for updated materials?

Are you struggling to fully grasp the concepts based on what you find online? Would you perhaps prefer to learn in a classroom setting instead?

### ***We have good news for you!***

Did you know that we travel to strategic places around the world, to teach our world-renowned exploit development classes.

In order to preserve and ensure a top-quality learning experience, all of our classes are delivered in-person.

I also teach private classes! For larger groups, I’ll glady come to you. For smaller groups, willing to travel to Belgium,  I’ll provide a training room near Bruges.

We currently offer 2 classes:

Our “[Bootcamp](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/bootcamp)” classes covers the basics of exploit development for Windows 11.

The “[Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced)” class covers heap exploitation for Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Both classes contain a short introduction on x64 exploitation!

You can find our schedules here: <https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training-schedules> .

> ***>>> Our classes tend to sell out fast, so sign up today and secure your seat in one of our classes !! <<<***

And if you’re not sure – [feel free to check what our students have to say about our classes](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/testimonials/).

Enjoy!

## Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 CMarkup use-after-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#239151

Original Release Date: 2014-05-21 | Last Revised: 2014-05-23

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 contains a use-after-free vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 contains a use-after-free vulnerability. This can allow for arbitrary code execution. Additional details may be found in the Zero Day Initiative advisory [ZDI-14-140](http://zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-14-140/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Users should upgrade to Internet Explorer 11. Users that are unable to upgrade past Internet Explorer 8 should consider the following workarounds. Windows XP users will not be able to upgrade past Internet Explorer 8. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will.**Disable ActiveX and Active Scripting**Set the Internet security zone setting to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. |

### Hi there!

Do you like our free content? Enjoying the materials we put together?

Are you interested in learning how to write exploits for Windows, but perhaps looking for updated materials?

Are you struggling to fully grasp the concepts based on what you find online? Would you perhaps prefer to learn in a classroom setting instead?

### ***We have good news for you!***

Did you know that we travel to strategic places around the world, to teach our world-renowned exploit development classes.

In order to preserve and ensure a top-quality learning experience, all of our classes are delivered in-person.

I also teach private classes! For larger groups, I’ll glady come to you. For smaller groups, willing to travel to Belgium,  I’ll provide a training room near Bruges.

We currently offer 2 classes:

Our “[Bootcamp](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/bootcamp)” classes covers the basics of exploit development for Windows 11.

The “[Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced)” class covers heap exploitation for Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Both classes contain a short introduction on x64 exploitation!

You can find our schedules here: <https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training-schedules> .

> ***>>> Our classes tend to sell out fast, so sign up today and secure your seat in one of our classes !! <<<***

And if you’re not sure – [feel free to check what our students have to say about our classes](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/testimonials/).

Enjoy!

## (0Day) Microsoft Internet Explorer CMarkup Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-14-140ZDI-CAN-1989

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-1770](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1770) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Internet Explorer 8](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['13972']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of CMarkup objects. The allocation initially happens within CMarkup::CreateInitialMarkup. The free happens after the execution of certain JavaScript code followed by a CollectGarbage call. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 180-day deadline.  Vendor Contact Timeline:10/11/2013 - Case disclosed to vendor02/10/2014 - Vendor confirmed reproduction 04/09/2014 - Original predicted disclosure (180 days)05/08/2014 - ZDI notified the vendor of the intent to publicly disclose05/21/2014 - ZDI publicly disclosed  -- Vendor Provided Mitigations:These are our mitigations which have been verified for this case:  - In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.  - An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  - By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of these vulnerabilities through the web-based attack scenario.  - By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates these vulnerabilities. See the FAQ section for these vulnerabilities for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.  The vendor also suggest the following workarounds:  - Set Internet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones  - Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone  - Install EMET, The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer. For more information about EMET, see The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit.  Vendor Patch:Vendor has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2969262)

Published: June 10, 2014 | Updated: June 17, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and fifty-eight privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Important for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, validates permissions, and handles negotiation of certificates during a TLS session. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of these vulnerabilities through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates these vulnerabilities. See the FAQ section for these vulnerabilities for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerabilities to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, see [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

## On CVE-2014-1770 / ZDI-14-140 : Internet Explorer 8 "0day"

Published May 22, 2014 | ![](https://www.corelan.be/wp-content/themes/corelan/images/postauthoricon.png)By [Peter Van Eeckhoutte (corelanc0d3r)](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/author/admin1/ "View all posts by Peter Van Eeckhoutte (corelanc0d3r)")

Hi all,

I have received a ton of questions regarding [a recently published ZDI advisory](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-14-140/), which provides some details about a bug I discovered and reported to Microsoft (via ZDI), affecting Internet Explorer 8.  I wanted to take a few moments to clarify some of the confusion and answer some of the questions in this post.

#### 1. Advisory vs Exploit

First of all, what was published is **an advisory, not an exploit**.  The advisory contains \*some\* details about the bug, but rest assured, it won’t be easy reproduce the vulnerability based on the advisory alone.   In other words, what has been disclosed is the fact that there’s a bug in IE and that it has not been patched (yet) after 180 days.  Some websites reported that "Microsoft won’t fix" the bug. As far as I can tell, this is speculation and may be (partially) right or just wrong. Only Microsoft knows, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.  Long story short, the actual exploit has not been released and there are no plans to do so at this point in time/before a patch gets released.

#### 2. So this is the only bug in ?

The "[Upcoming advisories](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/upcoming/)" list on the ZDI website shows that this is not the only vulnerability that has not been patched (not just in Microsoft software).  The website obviously only lists vulnerabilities that have been reported through ZDI. It’s hard to estimate how many bugs have not been reported (and may be used in the wild as we speak), how many have been reported through other means, or how many bugs have not been identified yet.  In any case, all of the bugs listed on the ZDI page have 2 things in common: they have been reported and a small number of people have details about the bug, due to the fact that it was reported to the vendor via ZDI.  Nothing special here.

Technically, all of those cases put us in the same position – it proves that affected systems are vulnerable. At the same time it doesn’t matter how long it takes for a bug to be patched because there’s always a chance that somebody else has discovered the same bug or another bug and may use it against us whenever he or she wants.  It is also clear that the faster bugs gets fixed, the better; and the more bugs get fixed, the better.  But it doesn’t guarantee 100% security because there’s always a chance a new/different bug was found or will be found.

Also, until a bug gets fixed, no patch is available.  Surprise surprise, all unpatched bugs are… hmmm… unpatched.

#### 3. If this bug gets patched, we’re safe, right ?  If not, we’re doomed ?

Achieving a zero-bug state in complex software (such as a web browser) is very unlikely.  That’s exactly why Operating Systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, OSX, Android, etc) have adopted additional security measures such as ASLR, DEP, Canaries, etc.   It doesn’t matter what OS or application you’re running. Focusing on just one bug and its time/delay to patch doesn’t really say much about your absolute level of security. We often don’t need to be worried about the known, but about the unknown. We need generic and layered defense, period.   Harden your OS, harden your apps, harden your browser.

#### 4. Is it really a dangerous bug ?

The ZDI advisory looks pretty accurate.  IE8 is affected and arbitrary code execution is definitely possible. As Microsoft indicates, [EMET](https://web.archive.org/web/20150225055018/http%3A//support.microsoft.com%3A80/kb/2458544) (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) will prevent the POC/exploit from achieving arbitrary code execution. In fact, it should be clear by now that installing EMET has become an important layer of defense on your Windows endpoints.  This case simply re-enforces this.  EMET won’t stop every single exploit, but it does increase the cost (for an attacker) to pwn a box. If you’re serious about security, install it. If you don’t care, install it too. It doesn’t matter if you’re using IE or not.

#### 5. 180 days

The fact that the vulnerability was reported back in October 2013 and still has not been patched may sound disconcerting, but I’m sure there must be a very good reason. 180 days is a number, a deadline, a commonly accepted period in which most bugs should get patched.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.   Again, only Microsoft knows exactly why. Everybody agrees that 180 days is a very long time, but I don’t believe this is an indication that Microsoft is ignoring bug reports or doesn’t care about security at all, so let’s not exaggerate things.  In fact, [Microsoft](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/security/dn440717) is doing an excellent job in handling vulnerability reports, issuing patches and crediting researchers.  I’m sure we can all come up with examples of (small and large) software companies that approach bug reports in a different way.  Additionally, the [BlueHat](http://blogs.technet.com/b/bluehat/) initiative is a good example of being pro-active and providing monetary rewards for cutting-edge security research.

Anyways, I am worried too about a 180-day delay to get a bug fixed.  But I would be really worried if the bug was actively being exploited and left unpatched for another 180 days.

I hope this short post clarifies some of your doubts and answers some of your questions. If not, please feel free to reach out.

cheers

Peter

### Hi there!

Do you like our free content? Enjoying the materials we put together?

Are you interested in learning how to write exploits for Windows, but perhaps looking for updated materials?

Are you struggling to fully grasp the concepts based on what you find online? Would you perhaps prefer to learn in a classroom setting instead?

### ***We have good news for you!***

Did you know that we travel to strategic places around the world, to teach our world-renowned exploit development classes.

In order to preserve and ensure a top-quality learning experience, all of our classes are delivered in-person.

I also teach private classes! For larger groups, I’ll glady come to you. For smaller groups, willing to travel to Belgium,  I’ll provide a training room near Bruges.

We currently offer 2 classes:

Our “[Bootcamp](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/bootcamp)” classes covers the basics of exploit development for Windows 11.

The “[Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced)” class covers heap exploitation for Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Both classes contain a short introduction on x64 exploitation!

You can find our schedules here: <https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training-schedules> .

> ***>>> Our classes tend to sell out fast, so sign up today and secure your seat in one of our classes !! <<<***

And if you’re not sure – [feel free to check what our students have to say about our classes](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/testimonials/).

Enjoy!
