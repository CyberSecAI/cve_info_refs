Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-1846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure availability of the `gdb` (GNU Debugger) method within the Enlightenment window manager's system actions helper. The original implementation allowed `gdb` to be invoked in a way that could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unsafe use of gdb:** The primary vulnerability is that the `gdb` method was available in an unsafe manner. This means it could be invoked or used in a way that bypasses security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   The impact is that by exploiting this insecure availability of `gdb`, a malicious user could potentially execute arbitrary programs with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves using the vulnerable `gdb` method of the Enlightenment window manager's system actions helper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the Enlightenment window manager.
-   An attacker would likely need to be a user who has the ability to execute the helper programs, which was not initially properly restricted.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the `gdb` method from the Enlightenment helper and running it as a regular user process if needed, respecting any system/distribution restrictions.
- Red Hat notes that Fedora was not directly affected because of Fedora's security defaults; however, it was included in the fix as a hardening measure.
