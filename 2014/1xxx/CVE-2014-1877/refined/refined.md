Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1877:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before it is stored in the database and subsequently displayed to other users. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize parameters such as "Phone," "Street," "Address line," "Zip code," and "City" in the user profile, as well as "Subject Topic" in social groups and the "Message" body, which leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS in multiple locations within the application.
    *   Profile Information: The `profile.php` script fails to sanitize input fields related to a user's profile.
    *   Social Groups: The `groups.php` script does not sanitize the "Subject Topic" field.
    *   Messages: The `view_message.php` script does not sanitize the message body itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content.
*   **Account Hijacking:** The injected scripts can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Defacement:** The injected code could also deface the website for other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Profile Manipulation:** An attacker can modify their profile information via `/dokeos-2.1.1/main/auth/profile.php`, inserting malicious JavaScript into fields such as "Phone," "Street," "Address line," "Zip code," or "City."
*   **Social Group Topic Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the "Subject Topic" field when creating or editing a social group via `/dokeos-2.1.1/main/social/groups.php?id=1`
*   **Message Body Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the message body via `/dokeos-2.1.1/main/messages/view_message.php?id=6&f=social`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Dokeos application to manipulate their profile or post messages/topics in social groups.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to interact with the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content shows the timeline of the vulnerability discovery and vendor notification attempts.
*   The vulnerability was tested on Dokeos version 2.1.1.
*   Specific XSS payloads used for testing are included in the report:
    *   `<![CDATA["><iframe/onload=alert(document.domain)>]]>` (for user profile fields)
    *   `"><video><source onerror=alert(domain)>` (for message bodies and topic subjects)
