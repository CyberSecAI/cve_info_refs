Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `entity_access()` API within the Drupal entity module does not adequately protect unpublished comments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:** Unprivileged users can view unpublished comments due to insufficient access checks in the `entity_access()` API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to content (unpublished comments) that should be restricted, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker can directly access unpublished comments by utilizing the vulnerable `entity_access()` API.
*   **Indirect Access:** Exploitation occurs through a module that utilizes the provided entity access API on comments, and the comment module must be enabled. An example module could be the RESTful Web Services module (RESTWS).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user, meaning they don't require any elevated privileges or administrative access to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Target System Access:** The attacker requires access to a Drupal instance with the vulnerable `entity` module enabled along with comment modules and any other module which uses the entity access API on comments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a module needs to be enabled which uses the entity access API on comments.
*   The issue was fixed in `drupal7-entity-1.3`.
