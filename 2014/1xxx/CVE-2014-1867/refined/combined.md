Use CVE-2014-1867. A commit reference isn't strictly necessary, but
without one we sometimes wait a short time for further information
before sending a CVE assignment, in case the issue (for example)
actually had multiple vulnerability types.

Subject: New upstream version fixing security issue
Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2014 22:15:39 +0200
```
Package: src:suphp
Version: 0.7.1-3
Severity: serious
Tags: security

>From <http://www.suphp.org/Home.html>

suPHP 0.7.2 has been released.
This release fixes a security issue that was introduced with the 0.7.0 release. This issue affected the source-highlighting feature and could only be exploited, if the suPHP_PHPPath option was set. In this case local users which could create or edit .htaccess files could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user the webserver was running as.

I am not sure whether this warrants a DSA, but I've set the severity RC
since not upgrading to a new point release that fixes a security bug for
jessie would be stupid (Ubuntu has already upgraded the package for trusty).

Note that this package is orphaned, so a QA upload (that also fixes
the maintainer field) is required.

Subject: (possible) CVE request: suPHP 0.7.2 release fixed a possible
arbitrary code execution
Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2014 07:30:17 +0100
```
Hi

I do not have a commit reference for this: suPHP 0.7.2 release fixed a
security ssue that was introduced with the 0.7.0 release. From
Upstream[1]:

----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----
suPHP 0.7.2 has been released.
This release fixes a security issue that was introduced with the 0.7.0
release. This issue affected the source-highlighting feature and could
only be exploited, if the suPHP_PHPPath option was set. In this case
local users which could create or edit .htaccess files could possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user the webserver
was running as.
----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----

Does this have already a CVE and/or should one be assigned?

suPHP is furthermore not anymore maintained upstream, see [3].

Use [CVE-2014-1867](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1867). A commit reference isn't strictly necessary, but
without one we sometimes wait a short time for further information
before sending a CVE assignment, in case the issue (for example)
actually had multiple vulnerability types.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
