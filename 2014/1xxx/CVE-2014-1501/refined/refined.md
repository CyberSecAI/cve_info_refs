Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1501:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Firefox for Android handles the "Open Link in New Tab" context menu option when a link uses the `file:` protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate URL validation:** When a user selects "Open Link in New Tab" for a link using the `file:///` URI scheme, Firefox for Android incorrectly opens a new tab with the local file path without performing adequate security checks.
- **Bypass of intended security behavior:** The desktop version of Firefox correctly prevents opening local files via the "Open Link in New Tab" functionality, whereas the Android version fails to implement the same restriction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local file access:** An attacker can craft a malicious webpage containing a link to a local file on the user's device. By tricking the user into long-pressing on this link and selecting "Open Link in New Tab", the attacker can gain access to that local file.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** It is stated that the accessed local file might be executed by Firefox, especially if it is a JavaScript file.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive local files if they know their precise location on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious webpage:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that includes a link using the `file:///` URI scheme.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to long-press on the malicious link and select the "Open Link in New Tab" option from the context menu.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to host a webpage accessible by the target's Firefox for Android browser.
- The attacker needs to know the full path to the target local file that they wish to access, since no path traversal is mentioned in the vulnerability description.
- The vulnerability is specific to the "Open Link in New Tab" context menu option, which requires a user action to trigger.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Firefox for Android only, and not other platforms.
- The fix involves mimicking the approach the desktop version of Firefox uses to prevent local file access.
- The fix involves applying a security check to the "Open in new tab" function to ensure that file:// URLs are not loaded by calling `urlSecurityCheck`.
- The fix was applied in Firefox 28 and verified in Firefox 29.
- This issue was rated as a security vulnerability with a "moderate" severity and the `sec-moderate` keyword was applied to the bug.
