Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Chrome OS](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/03/stable-channel-update-for-chrome-os_14.html "Stable Channel Update for Chrome OS")

Friday, March 14, 2014

The Stable channel has been updated to 33.0.1750.152 (Platform version: 5116.115.4/5116.115.5) for all devices. This build contains security fixes for Pwnium. Systems will be receiving the updates over the next few days.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Congratulations to [geohot](http://geohot.com/) for an epic Pwnium competition win. Pinkie Pie provided a fascinating set of vulnerabilities that will be rewarded through the Chrome VRP program. Moreover, one of the bugs exploited by VUPEN on Pwn2Own affected Chrome OS.

We’re delighted at the success of Pwnium and the ability to study full exploits. We anticipate landing additional changes and hardening measures for these vulnerabilities in the near future. We also believe that both Pwnium submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition. We plan to do technical reports on these submissions in the future.
