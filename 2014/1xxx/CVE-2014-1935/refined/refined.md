  "cveId": "CVE-2014-1935",
  "description": "9base 1:6-6 and 1:6-7 insecurely creates temporary files which results in predictable filenames.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "source": "bugs.debian.org_40e9cb93_20250126_055709.html",
      "rootCause": "The `rc` program, part of the `9base` package, creates temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable filenames and without using the `O_EXCL` flag, making them vulnerable to race conditions and potential exploitation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
         "Predictable filenames",
         "Missing `O_EXCL` flag"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite or manipulate temporary files created by `rc`, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other malicious activities.",
      "attackVectors": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to predict the filename `rc` uses to create a temporary file, then create a file with the same name before `rc` does.",
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to create files in the `/tmp` directory and the knowledge of the naming scheme used by `rc`."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",

      "impact": "The vulnerability allows for a potential attack due to predictable filenames.",
        "attackVectors": "Network",
      "requiredCapabilities": "None, indicating that no specific user interaction or privileges are needed for exploitation."
