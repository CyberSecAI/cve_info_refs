As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that the services operated by Mozilla continue to meet the current needs of Mozilla, the following VCS systems have been decommissioned:

* cvs.mozilla.org via [bug 985022](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=985022)
* bzr.mozilla.org via [bug 967642](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967642)
* git.mozilla.org via [bug 1277297](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1277297)

This work took coordinated effort between IT, Developer Services, and the remaining active users of those systems. Thanks to all of them for their contributions!

Final archives of the public CVS and BZR repositories are currently available at <https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/vcs-archive/>. The README file has instructions for retrieval of non-public repositories.

Archives were not generated for repositories formerly hosted at git.mozilla.org, because all relevant content has been migrated to GitHub.

For any questions or concerns, please contact the [Developer Services](/DeveloperServices "DeveloperServices") team.

# 4.5.3, 4.4.3, 4.2.8, and 4.0.12

Thursday, Apr 17th, 2014
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that an attacker could
  force the victim to log in using the attacker's credentials.

* Dangerous control characters can be inserted into Bugzilla, notably
  into bug comments, which can then be used to execute local commands.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.4.2, 4.5.1 to 4.5.2
Fixed In:    4.4.3, 4.5.3
Description: The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that
              an attacker could force the victim to log in using the
              attacker's credentials. If the victim then reports a new
              security sensitive bug, the attacker would get immediate
              access to this bug.
              Due to changes involved in the Bugzilla API, this fix is
              not backported to the 4.0 and 4.2 branches, meaning that
              Bugzilla 4.0.12 and older, and 4.2.8 and older, will
              remain vulnerable to this issue.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=713926
CVE Number:  CVE-2014-1517

Class:       Social Engineering
Affected:    Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.0.11, 4.1.1 to 4.2.7, 4.3.1 to 4.4.2, 4.5.1 to 4.5.2
Fixed In:    4.0.12, 4.2.8, 4.4.3, 4.5.3
Description: Dangerous control characters can be inserted into
             Bugzilla, notably into bug comments. If the text, which
             may look safe, is copied into a terminal such as xterm or
             gnome-terminal, then unexpected commands could be executed
             on the local machine.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=968576
CVE Number:  none

[spinning off from [bug 471801](/show_bug.cgi?id=471801 "NEW")]
The (CGI-based) login form lacks any type of CSRF protection. This is needed to alleviate the concern specified in section 3 of Adam Barth's CSRF paper (<http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf>) where an attacker could cause a user to authenticate to Bugzilla using the \*attacker's\* credentials.
While not optimal, this restricts login form uses to the user's IP plus the time period of MAX\_TOKEN\_AGE.

I've tested this, and it works as expected both with a valid token and without a valid token.

Attached patch

[patch - v2](attachment.cgi?id=585083&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=585083&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=713926&attachment=585083)

Previous patch had two bugs
1) Login page wasn't excluding the 'GoAheadAndLogIn' and 'token' params
2) If user has valid login but invalid token, clicking "confirm" on the confirm action page will still not log the user in, as Bugzilla\_login and Bugzilla\_password are not given as hidden fields
I fixed 1), and I tried to fix 2), but I got to thinking that we shouldn't be saving those fields as hidden fields anyway, so the user is just going to have to log in again.
One concern, though: The confirm action page is more for actual changes, rather than logging in. As such, the text is slightly confusing. I could fix this, but I would basically have to duplicate most of confirm-action.html.tmpl into another block. If that's wanted, I'm happy to do that.
The comment move is because I was digging into hidden-fields, and the comment was in the wrong place, which was confusing me.

Actually, we need separate login tokens from normal tokens, as we don't want to wipe out a valid token for some specific action with our trivial login token. This version separates the two ("login\_token" vs. "token").
I also separated the text in confirm-action, but I find what I did very messy. I tried a few things, and I didn't like any of them. Thoughts?
How do I get rid of the extra whitespace here?

This line is too long. Also, you are going to generate two login tokens per page. Are you sure your code handles this correctly?

You exclude GoAheadAndLogIn with no explicit reason. Could you explain why you do this and did you make sure this has no side-effect (even in less obvious cases)? I know it's redefined later in this template, but it's just to make sure we are not regressing anything.

You cannot use cgi.param() here. cgi is undefined unless you define it explicitly. Also, I'm not convinced that looking at GoAheadAndLogIn is the right way to go.
Also, I see that you duplicate a lot of text and add a lot of checks about GoAheadAndLogIn. If templates are so different, then a separate template would be better than messing this one.

Yes. They are just hash tokens, and based on how they are created, they are generally the same. I will split the line in my next update.

As I mentioned in [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=713926#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Login form lacks CSRF protection"), if I don't exclude GoAheadAndLogIn and login\_token, they get copied back in, which will interfere with the the new fields that get added a few lines below that. I've tested a variety of cases, and I haven't seen any problems, but I'm happy to try some other stuff.

Hmm, weird. Seemed to work in my testing (the right text was being displayed), but maybe the undef part was what was causing it to work. If you don't think GoAheadAndLogIn is the right way, what alternatives do you propose? Some variable somehow? I could swap to testing for 'login\_token' now that the two are split.

Yeah, thought about that. Would just mean I would have to modify check\_hash\_token() somehow (new param?) to make it use the different template. I will see what seems to work best.

I talked about this issue on IRC with reed yesterday, and I still want a PoC before going further. I don't see how this is exploitable. Being logged in with the attacker's credentials is not a security issue as you cannot do any harm; for instance, you can no longer access security bugs if the attacker couldn't access the bug himself.Severity: normal → minor

Example I mentioned on IRC:
\* Attacker causes the victim to login to Bugzilla as the attacker. Victim submits security bug. Attacker immediately has access to bug, as it was filed as the attacker instead of the victim.Severity: minor → normal

Note that Bugzilla::Auth::Login::CGI is also called by the User.login webservice method, and so requiring a token would break WebServices as you would be unable to log in. I did some investigation, and there is no way to distinguish a valid User.login call and an evil one as XMLHttpRequest lets you change the Content-Type header to application/json.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=713926&attachment=8369134)

As mentioned in [bug 726696 comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=726696#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - All authenticated WebServices methods should require username/pass, token or a valid API key for authentication")
The main login page generates a cookie which is stored in the web browser and a corresponding token is included in the login form. When the user submits his credentials, the token is compared with the cookie to make sure the submission is intentional. If cookies are disabled, it falls back to the Referer header to make sure it's a local submission and not one coming from some external website.
The mini login forms in the page header and footer do not include the token nor do they generate a token as we would have to do it all the time, for all pages being viewed while being logged out. This seems to be overkill. As long as the Referer header is available, this is not a problem, else an error will be thrown asking the user to log in again, this time from the main login page. I cannot automatically generate a token without its cookie counterpart, else the attacker could copy it in his remote attack.
For WebServices, it bypasses this check as Bugzilla::Auth::Persist::Cookie no longer creates cookies for them. It only creates a token which can then be returned by User.login. This also means that an attacker can no longer override your login cookies and so the victim won't do subsequent actions on his behalf.Assignee: reed → LpSolit

The mini login form now also includes a token, which must match the cookie to validate the request. If cookies are disabled, we still fall back to the Referer header.
Bugzilla is so impractical with cookies disabled (requires login for each action) that I would be tempted to say that cookies should be mandatory, which would let me remove the Referer header check.

Not going to take this on 4.2 because it requires stuff that we can't backport that far as a prerequisite. This will go in 4.4 and trunk only. The security advisory will need to point out that it isn't fixed in the older branches because of API breakage, and people who want paranoid security should upgrade.Target Milestone: Bugzilla 4.2 → Bugzilla 4.4

But you can't do cross-site XMLHTTPRequest without a CORS agreement, which Bugzilla will not give.
(Of course, [bug 726696](/show_bug.cgi?id=726696 "RESOLVED FIXED - All authenticated WebServices methods should require username/pass, token or a valid API key for authentication"), but still.)
I think it may now be reasonable to require cookies for logging in to Bugzilla. Every web client supports cookies, and many have or can have per-site cookie control. The user experience without cookies is pretty miserable. Back in 2000 at Oxford University, they had a weird cookie-stripping firewall so I had to log in for every change. This was so annoying that I downloaded a keystroke scripting app so I could press a single key and it would type my username and password and submit the form...

You don't need a CORS agreement to call WS methods. You just won't get the answer back, but the damage is already done. So no, it's not OK to accept cookies.

This bug is specifically about login. No damage is done if the attacker causes the user's browser to send a HEAD (or is it OPTIONS) request to the login URL, and Bugzilla fails to return the relevant CORS headers so the browser goes no further.
Damage can only be done if either a) the user actually gets logged in, or b) the attacker gets the user's credentials or cookie. And neither can happen in this scenario.

Sigh. LpSolit made a valid point that we need to backport [bug 893195](/show_bug.cgi?id=893195 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow token based authentication for webservices") before this can be accepted for 4.4. Removing flag for 4.4 for now.

Shouldn't it be "Added in Bugzilla 4.4.3"? At least "4.x" is clearly wrong as 4.0.x, 4.2.x and 4.4, 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 don't have it.

Otherwise works fine. r=LpSolit

This needs to be changed and may as well do it now if the patch is getting revised anyway.
For REST, you may also use the C<login> and C<password> variable
names instead of C<Bugzilla\_login> and C<Bugzilla\_password> as a
convenience. You may also use C<token> instead of C<Bugzilla\_token>.

This bug is probably the reason why BZ 4.4.3 and later no longer returns cookies when xmlrpc User.login is called. Can anyone clarify actual risks? There's some discussion around [comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=713926#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Login form lacks CSRF protection"), but it does not seem to have enough detail to identify attack vector being blocked. Thank you!

API documentation got this text as part of this change:
Support for using login cookies for authentication has been dropped
for security reasons.
This does not seem accurate based on testing with a BZ instance that already got this fix. Both cookies obtained before update, as well as new cookies generated by splitting token value are accepted as authentication for xmlrpc requests.
Is that cookie support expected to be removed in future versions?

Hi,
what about 4.2? patch from this BZ doesn't apply to 4.2.9.

<http://www.bugzilla.org/security/4.0.11/>
Due to changes involved in the Bugzilla API, this fix is
not backported to the 4.0 and 4.2 branches, meaning that
Bugzilla 4.0.12 and older, and 4.2.8 and older, will
remain vulnerable to this issue.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
