{
  "guidelines_followed": true,
  "relevancy": "Relevant",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) improperly processes user-supplied input, leading to a dangling pointer and use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Dangling pointer",
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by running a specially crafted application.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs valid logon credentials and must be able to log on locally to the vulnerable system. No network access is required, it's a local privilege escalation.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability resides in the afd.sys driver, which handles Windows sockets. The issue lies in the failure to properly handle error conditions leading to a pointer not being reset. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to raise privileges and execute code under the context of SYSTEM."
