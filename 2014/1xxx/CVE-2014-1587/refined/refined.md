Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-1587:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2014-1587 lies in several memory safety bugs within the browser engine used by Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. These bugs involve a variety of issues like memory corruption, use-after-free, and buffer overflows.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Safety Errors:** The core issue is a collection of memory safety bugs, indicating problems with memory management and potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
*  **Use-After-Free:** This vulnerability exists specifically in  `DirectionalityUtils.cpp`, where improperly handled text during directionality resolution and layout causes a use-after-free scenario (CVE-2014-1581).
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** A buffer overflow in `mozilla::FileBlockCache::Read` allows arbitrary code execution via crafted media content (CVE-2014-1593).
*   **SDP Parser Memory Corruption:** The SIPCC SDP parser can cause memory corruption when handling malformed SDP data (Bug 1089207). The parser's loop was expecting a newline character, but received a null character in some cases and continued to iterate out of bounds.
*   **DataChannel/SCTP Timer Loop Crash:** A crash can occur in the DataChannels/SCTP timer loop when one end of the connection is stalled during debugging. (Bug 1080312). The crash was a use-after-free due to a timer trying to access deallocated memory.
*   **Crash in js::FetchName:** The Javascript Engine has a crash in `js::FetchName` due to how `Object.freeze` interacts with prototype. This also caused an assertion failure related to `shape->hasSlot()` (Bug 1042567).
*   **XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send DoS:** A crafted JavaScript object could crash the application using the send method (CVE-2014-1590)
*   **nsHtml5TreeOperation Use-After-Free:** A use-after-free when adding a second root element to an HTML5 document during parsing (CVE-2014-1592).

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially gaining full control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Certain vulnerabilities can lead to application crashes, resulting in a denial of service for the user.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation can lead to memory corruption, which could cause application instability and potentially lead to further vulnerabilities being exploited.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some scenarios, like the camera sharing issue (CVE-2014-1586 and CVE-2014-1585), sensitive data like video from the user's local camera could be exposed.
*  **Security Restriction Bypasses:** Some vulnerabilities may allow attackers to bypass existing security restrictions, granting access to protected resources or functions.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages:**  An attacker could craft malicious web pages or iframes that trigger the vulnerabilities when viewed by the victim. This can be done through various ways, such as malformed HTML, crafted media content or JavaScript.
*  **Email:**  Since many of these issues are located in the browser engine or shared components, they are also applicable to mail clients. While some are mitigated due to lack of Javascript execution, some vulnerabilities such as those related to parsing or memory safety, could still be exploited in email contexts.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability in `DirectionalityUtils.cpp` can be exploited through crafted text over the network. The buffer overflow in `mozilla::FileBlockCache::Read` is exploited via crafted media content. The SIPCC SDP parser vulnerability can be triggered by malformed SDP data.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** Many of the vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely via network attacks.
*   **No Authentication:** Often, no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **User Interaction:** Some attacks require the user to interact with malicious content, such as opening a specially crafted web page, email or a malicious media file.

In summary, CVE-2014-1587 is an umbrella CVE that refers to a collection of memory safety and related vulnerabilities in Mozilla products. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, data exposure, and other security impacts. The attack vectors are mainly through web browsing or email, and the attackers generally do not require any authentication or specialized privileges to exploit the issues.
