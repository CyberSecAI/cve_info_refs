  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2014-1771": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer incorrectly handles negotiation of certificates during a TLS session.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of TLS certificate negotiation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could hijack a mutually authenticated TLS connection between Internet Explorer and an arbitrary target server. An attacker could then potentially decrypt portions of encrypted traffic and retrieve information such as authentication cookies.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could leverage the TLS renegotiation command to reestablish a valid TLS session through a malicious third party."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to initiate a TLS renegotiation with the target server and be positioned to intercept the traffic between the victim and the server."
