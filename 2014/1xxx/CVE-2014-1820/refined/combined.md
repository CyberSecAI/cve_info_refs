## Vulnerabilities in SQL Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2984340)

Published: August 12, 2014 | Updated: August 13, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server (one in SQL Server Master Data Services and the other in the SQL Server relational database management system). The more severe of these vulnerabilities, affecting SQL Server Master Data Services, could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits a specially crafted website that injects a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer. In all cases, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 3, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 2, and Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1; it is also rated Important for Microsoft SQL Server 2014 for x64-based Systems. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SQL Master Data Services (MDS) encodes output and how SQL Server handles T-SQL queries. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating. **Note:** In certain scenarios, customers using Microsoft SQL Server Master Data Service (MDS) may not be able to obtain this update through automatic updating. See the Known Issues entries in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2969894](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2969894) for more information and workaround steps.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the Affected Software table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## SQL Master Data Services XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1820

An XSS vulnerability exists in SQL Master Data Services (MDS) that could allow an attacker to inject a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the site on behalf of the targeted user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1820](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1820).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, and Internet Explorer 11 prevents this attack for users when browsing to websites in the Internet Zone. Note that the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, and Internet Explorer 11 is enabled by default in the Internet zone, but is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Enable Internet Explorer 8** **,** **Internet Explorer 9** **, Internet Explorer 10, and Internet Explorer 11** **XSS filter for Intranet Zone**

You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone. (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone.) To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, or Internet Explorer 11 click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
2. Click the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom level**.
4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Impact of workaround**. Internal sites not previously flagged as being XSS risks could be flagged.

**How to undo the workaround.**

To undo this workaround, perform the following steps.

1. In Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, or Internet Explorer 11 click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
2. Click the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom level**.
4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

### FAQ

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the SQL Master Data Services (MDS) does not properly encode output.

**What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script into the response to a webpage request. This script is then run by the requesting application, often times a web browser. The script could then spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected website, on behalf of the targeted user.

**What is SQL Master Data Services (MDS)?**

Master Data Services (MDS) is the SQL Server solution for master data management. Master data management (MDM) describes the efforts made by an organization to discover and define non-transactional lists of data, with the goal of compiling maintainable master lists.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the site on behalf of the targeted user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted link to the user and convincing the user to click the link. An attacker could also host a website that contains a webpage designed to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Servers running affected editions of Microsoft SQL Server are primarily at risk. SQL servers that do not have SQL Master Data Services installed are not at risk of this vulnerability and will not be offered this update.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the SQL Master Data Services (MDS) encodes output.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**
