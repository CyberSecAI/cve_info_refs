    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsTextEditRules::CreateMozBR function in Mozilla Firefox before 30.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.6, and Thunderbird before 24.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service (heap memory corruption)",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, via unspecified vectors (crafted web content, email)",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, no authentication required, user-assisted (opening a crafted web page or email)",
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox",
      "Firefox ESR",
      "Thunderbird",
	  "SeaMonkey"
    ],
	"root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the `nsTextEditRules::CreateMozBR` function. The vulnerability exists because the memory associated with a created object is freed, and then, an attempt is made to access the freed memory, which can result in arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
	"details" : "The root cause is a use-after-free error where the program tries to access an object that has already been freed from memory, caused by improper memory management in how the `nsTextEditRules::CreateMozBR` method is called and how the object's life cycle is managed. Additionally, out-of-bounds read issues are present which leads to an exploitable state. When combined, these issues lead to a heap memory corruption vulnerability allowing for remote code execution or a denial of service."
