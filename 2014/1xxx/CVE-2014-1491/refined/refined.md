Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1491:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `lists.opensuse.org`, `www.ubuntu.com` and `bugzilla.mozilla.org` explicitly mention **CVE-2014-1491** in the context of security updates for Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and NSS.
*   The Oracle document, `www.oracle.com_777c9052` and `www.oracle.com_ec25c664` specifically cite CVE-2014-1491 as a vulnerability that has been addressed with the associated patch update.
*   The VMware document also mentions CVE-2014-1491 as a reference to a security fix, however, it's incorrectly listed in the Oracle document.
*   The `lists.opensuse.org_5662080a` and `secunia.com` entries also list this CVE.
*   The `security.gentoo.org` entry also confirms this CVE in the context of the related Mozilla product fixes.

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2014-1491.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause is a flaw in the handling of Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange parameters in the Network Security Services (NSS) library, specifically in the processing of session tickets.
    *   The NSS library does not properly restrict the public values in Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. Specifically, it accepts the value `p-1` (where `p` is a prime) as a valid public DH parameter. This can lead to security issues.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Inadequate Validation of DH Parameters:** The NSS library does not correctly validate Diffie-Hellman parameters. It allows public values that are not within the expected range, specifically, the value `p-1` which can lead to a weaker pre-master secret.
    *   **Bypass of cryptographic protection mechanisms:**  By accepting an invalid public value, the DH key agreement can be compromised, potentially leading to the ability to decrypt the connection.
    *   **Incorrect IDNA Domain Matching:** In some instances, incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates could allow invalid certificates to be considered valid (as seen in the Oracle advisory), though this is not a core part of CVE-2014-1491. This is more directly tied to another vulnerability, CVE-2014-1492, which is often resolved in tandem with CVE-2014-1491.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A successful exploit could enable an attacker to potentially:
        *   Bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms.
        *   Cause a denial of service (as seen in the Ubuntu document and Redhat/opensuse documents).
        *   Compromise session keys, potentially allowing an attacker to decrypt traffic or replay a session.
         *   Bypass security restrictions (as mentioned in the Ubuntu document)
     *    Man-in-the-middle attacks
    *  The `bugzilla.mozilla.org` entry also describes how a compromised pre-master secret can be used in conjunction with channel bindings in other browser implementations such as Chrome leading to client authentication problems.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is primarily exposed through TLS handshakes using DH key exchange.
    *   A malicious server (or a man-in-the-middle) can send specially crafted DH parameters, including a public value of `p-1`, to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The vulnerability occurs on the server-side when the software handling the DHE exchange is accepting `p-1` as a valid value during parameter validation.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *  The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the TLS handshake, either by directly controlling a malicious server or performing a man-in-the-middle attack.
   *  Knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the malicious DH parameters is required.
   *   No attacker authentication is required to exploit this.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves adding bounds checking to the DH public values to ensure that they are not 0, 1, p-1, or greater than or equal to p (where p is the prime modulus). This is detailed in the `hg.mozilla.org` entry.
*  The vulnerability arises because a server can cause a client to compute the same pre-master secret on different connections, breaking perfect forward secrecy guarantees.

**4. Severity:**

*   Multiple sources indicate that this is a high severity vulnerability (although the final severity of 'sec-moderate' is decided in the mozilla bugzilla entry). This is due to the ability to compromise session keys, the possibility of DoS and the potential to bypass cryptographic protection.
*   The Oracle CPU for January 2016 categorizes it as a high vulnerability with high confidentiality, integrity and availability (on Windows only).

**5. Impact on different products:**

*   **Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, Seamonkey:** The identified documents mention the vulnerability impacting the core security library used in these products, requiring updates for users to prevent exploitation. The specific versions impacted are detailed in various sources.
*   **Oracle Database, Fusion Middleware, and other Oracle Products:** The advisory lists that the patches address CVE-2014-1491 in the NSS library that Oracle products may be using. Patches for various versions are made available.
*   **VMware vSphere:**  The VMware advisory refers to this CVE when listing all the vulnerabilities addressed with the update.
*   **Other products**: Other vendors including Gentoo, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu acknowledge this vulnerability in relation to product updates.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2014-1491 is a significant security vulnerability related to the handling of DH key exchange parameters in NSS, potentially leading to information disclosure, security bypass, and denial of service. The provided information highlights the technical details of the flaw and the fix. This vulnerability has been addressed in multiple product updates, which underscores the potential impact and severity.
