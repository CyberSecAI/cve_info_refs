{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `name.html` file in easyXDM uses the `location.hash` value to determine the URL of the document to load. The value of this parameter was not being filtered, allowing an attacker to pass a javascript: URL that could execute arbitrary Javascript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
      "DOM-based XSS"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML, leading to execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of the domain hosting the EasyXDM installation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload in the `location.hash` of the `name.html` file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a URL that includes a malicious `javascript:` URI and convince a user to access it. This could be done by sending a crafted link or embedding it in a page accessible to the victim. Additionally the attacker needs to set up a provider frame with the `easyXDM_channel_provider` name."
