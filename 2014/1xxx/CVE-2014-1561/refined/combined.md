+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #910375](/show_bug.cgi?id=910375 "VERIFIED FIXED - New PanelUI / toolbar customization event spoofing") +++
It is possible to craft a drag and drop event in content which mimics the behavior of a chrome customization event. This attack is very unlikely as it requires the user to have the customizable page / panel open and then drag and drop from another window to the page. The impact is also very low since all an attacker can do is move icons around. The current chrome code only uses the event to pick an icon to move.
Marking this as security sensitive because [bug 910375](/show_bug.cgi?id=910375 "VERIFIED FIXED - New PanelUI / toolbar customization event spoofing") was also security sensitive.

This only accepts the customize window and the gToolboxDocument's window. I verified this works in SeaMonkey to defeat the exploit and still allow cross-window drags between the customize window and the window being customized.Assignee: nobody → gijskruitbosch+bugsStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Marco, can you ensure this is on QA's radar? Probably easiest to test with either Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.

I was able to reproduce the issue with SeaMonkey Nightly and Aurora builds, using the testcase from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1000514#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Toolkit toolbar dialog customization event spoofing") and steps to reproduce from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1000514#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Toolkit toolbar dialog customization event spoofing"). However there don't seem to be any more Nightly builds for Seamonkey since June 19 (I searched for them at ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/). Am I not searching in the right place, or is there a reason for no new Nightly builds in one week?
Note: would verifying this on SeaMonkey be enough to mark the bug verified? The bug has the "status-firefox33: fixed" flag, but I cannot reproduce the problem with Firefox.Flags: needinfo?(mmucci)

I think that is the right place, and I think the reason is that SeaMonkey builds are pretty busted up right now, for various reasons. It took me the best part of a day to get it to build and work on this bug. Neil, do you know if there's an ETA for when there'll be nightlies again?

I'm not aware of any way to reproduce with Firefox directly, but the code lives in toolkit, and we ship it, so that's the flag that would need to be updated (especially as there is no alternative flag).Flags: needinfo?(neil)

I think 1027241 is our major stumbling block right now, and it has a patch, but I can't predict how long it will take for it to land.Flags: needinfo?(neil)

A mac nightly was produced today: <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/2014-06-30-00-30-01-comm-central-trunk/> (sadly it seems win32 and linux nightly generation is still broken - but it should be possible to verify this on mac and the problem isn't OS-specific, so that should be OK)Flags: needinfo?(florin.mezei)

Thanks for the heads up Gijs. I've verified this today on Mac OS X 10.9.3 (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0 SeaMonkey/2.30a1). The issue reproduces with SeaMonkey Nightly build from June 19th (BuildID: 20140619003001). The issue no longer reproduces with SeaMonkey Nightly build from June 30th (BuildID: 20140630003001), as the icon from the testcase can no longer be moved to any toolbar, while cross-window drags between the customize window and the window being customized work fine.

I hate to be a party pooper, but while the lack of drag from content is obviously good news, the OSX customise window uses a sheet, not a separate window.

Neil, with the situation for Linux and Windows builds being what it is, do you think you'd be able to provide a build for either of those to test with?Flags: needinfo?(neil)

I asked around and KaiRo said he had a local Linux self-build so I asked him to test toolbar customisation on it and he said it seemed to work properly. (I didn't ask him to try the test case assuming that testing on OSX sufficed.)Flags: needinfo?(neil)

There are some issues with the SeaMonkey build machines, from what the team tells me, but IIRC, Aurora and Beta should have Windows building fine with the current machines.

Verified as fixed on Windows 7 x64, using SeaMonkey 2.29a2 Aurora build from July 2nd (BuildID: 20140702013001), as the icon from the testcase can no longer be moved to any toolbar, while cross-window drags between the customize window and the window being customized work fine.
I could not find any SeaMonkey 2.28 Beta builds yet... I'll keep an eye out for them so I can also verify this on Beta.

(I don't know why there are neither nightlies nor betas listed in the right directories on the ftp server, but this build is from today, so I would expect it to have the required changes)

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-60

## Toolbar dialog customization event spoofing

Announced
July 22, 2014
Reporter
David Chan, Gijs Kruitbosch
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 31

### Description

Mozilla developers **David Chan** and **Gijs
Kruitbosch** reported that it is possible to create a drag and drop event
in web content which mimics the behavior of a chrome customization event. This
can occur when a user is customizing a page or panel. This results in a limited
ability to move UI icons within the visible window but does not otherwise affect
customization or window content.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It is possible to craft a drag and drop event in content which mimics the behavior of a chrome customization event. This attack is very unlikely as it requires the user to have the customizable page / panel open and then drag and drop from another window to the page. The impact is also very low since all an attacker can do is move icons around. The current chrome code only uses the event to pick an icon to move.
Marking this as security sensitive though it likely doesn't have to be since the code hasn't shipped yet.
STR
1. Open about:customizing
2. Open above file in another window or visit
<https://people.mozilla.com/~dchan/drag.html>
3. Drag the Firefox icon to one of the about:customizing panels
Result
The Subscribe icon moves
Expected
Icon doesn't move

I wonder if there should be a comment with each of these new blocks since this isn't a common pattern in the codebase and others may not realize it's for security reasons. Perhaps now that the check is getting lengthier we could create a helper that is more self-documenting. That function could have a comment explaining the issue being addressed. Example:
if (this.isUnwantedDragDrop(aEvent)) {
return;
}
I don't think we need to avoid comments since as dchan says, this isn't shipped code yet.
IIUC, this will prevent us from switching customization mode to it's own document (as proposed in [bug 900122](/show_bug.cgi?id=900122 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Investigate moving customization markup from browser.xul to an external file")) without modification. In that case I believe the window would be different for the palette. I think that's fine as I think [bug 900122](/show_bug.cgi?id=900122 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Investigate moving customization markup from browser.xul to an external file") is unlikely to happen since there weren't noticeable perf wins and it affected addon-compat. We can always tweak this is we need.
Please make the commit message less generic by mentioning customization.

Move all of the new blocks up as they're not using |document| and I'd rather bail as soon as possible when this happens. I would probably prefer this to go before \_\_dumpDragData just to make sure we don't do too much with the unwanted drag.
Since mozSourceNode can be null (see the IDL), we should probably also check that it's truthy before accessing the ownerDocument otherwise we will output TypeError's to the browser console when dragging between external applications over Firefox in customization mode. Even if it's rare, we should try not to add console spew.

mozSourceNode is null when running the tests, but it's not null when manually using a mouse to drag items. I attached a debugger and nsContentUtils::GetDragSession is returning null within nsDOMDataTransfer::GetMozSourceNode.
Neil, do you see any issues with the drag/drop code in head.js at <http://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/annotate/a6fe43be166c/browser/components/customizableui/test/head.js#l95> ? I don't think the synthesizeDragStart is necessary there, but commenting it out doesn't fix the issue. I wonder if this is a deeper issue within ChromeUtils or EventUtils.Flags: needinfo?(neil)

synthesizeDragStart/synthesizeDrop are used only for testing whether the right data is being put into the dataTransfer. Neither cause a real drop to occur, so they don't set the source node. There isn't a means of testing real drag and drops.Flags: needinfo?(enndeakin)

I dislike relying on exceptions for this when we can check getPrefType(…) == Ci.nsIPrefBranch.PREF\_BOOL. That way other exceptions are not swallowed and my understanding is that try…catch can affect JS perf.
It seems like there could be a perf impact of repeatedly calling these pref functions during drag/drop operations. We may want to use a pref observer and stash the value on a property. Another option would be to skip this pref stuff if you're not in a DEBUG build but that would mean we wouldn't be able to test this in non-debug builds. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you want to do something about potential perf. It's not a commonly used code-path but it's somewhat hot.

<https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/ux/rev/94231fdf1158>
I removed the try/catch in favor of using getPrefType. Thanks, I didn't know about that method before.
I also now cache the value of the pref in a member. I didn't use a pref observer because this pref is not likely to change at runtime and as such we shouldn't take on the overhead of another observer for something that isn't important on the fly like this.
All tests passed locally when running with this patch, as well as manual testing.Whiteboard: [Australis:P4][Australis:M9][fixed-in-ux]

Doesn't this mean that clearing the user pref in your tests don't do anything for the subsequent tests since the value is memoized?
Also, I just realized that this bug didn't add a test to ensure that unwanted drops are ignored.

Followup patch
I think if we're going this route, it makes more sense to just set the member each time we enter customize mode, rather than adding/removing pref observers all the time. If we had a reliable destructor we could use that to destroy the pref observer when the window goes away, and only init it once, but apparently we do not (for customize mode).
(of course, I'm going on the assumption that it's cheaper to read the pref than to add+remove the observer, which may or may not be true depending on how sane our pref service is)

We had to initialize the cached pref value anyways when entering customization mode with the previous patch, so this makes it a little simpler by ignoring any pref changes while in customization mode.

AFAIK, this issue was specific to the UX branch. I wasn't able to reproduce with current release / beta / aurora. The custom UI files don't seem to exist in the non-UX branches. I tested with the latest UX nightly and the bug appears to be fixed, no events are fired when drag-dropping cross-originFlags: needinfo?(dchan)

It appears that release, beta and aurora are affected using the same poc.
Open 2 windows
Navigate one of them to the poc
Open View -> Toolbars -> Customize on the other
Drag Firefox icon to browser chrome, subscribe icon moves
Drag back to "Customize toolbar", subscribe icon moves back
I tested on Windows Fx 26 and Linux Fx 27, 28.

I don't /think/ so. If you prefer I can remove it.

No, it is always true. I suspect the dragover has nothing to do with the dragstart as far as isTrusted is concerned.

Yes, the customizableui tests use the synthesize drag/drops but the source node is not properly set by the synthesize code. Removing this pref on non-Australis repos shouldn't cause any issues but it will need to remain on Australis-populated repos for the customizableui tests to pass.

If I correctly understand the code calling isUnwantedDragEvent, then it may run for D&D actions originating from a toolbar, and if I understand mozSourceNode correctly, it would belong to the browser window in that case and fail the above test. Let me know if I misunderstood something.

Is this also affecting FF30 and up? We're going to build our final FF29 on Monday so given this is sec-low and the patch isn't looking nearly ready we're likely a miss here for 29 but should track for 30 and up.

No, I believe this is fixed in 29 and up since the fix stayed with Australis which is getting released in 29. I just confirmed \_isUnwantedDragDrop is on mozilla-beta.

FWIW, this isn't fixed for e.g. the toolbar customization window in the library, or other non-browser.xul toolbar customization. We should still fix the toolkit issue.

I think so.

I think this stuff should move to another bug so we can track it appropriately with the status flags.
Since it's using the same technique on other applications/windows, I don't think we should disclose this in an advisory until that new bug is fixed.Flags: needinfo?(MattN+bmo)

Please link back to this bug in the new bugs so when they are fixed, we don't forget to write an advisory for the whole set.Whiteboard: [Australis:P4][Australis:M9][adv-main29+] → [Australis:P4][Australis:M9][adv-main29-]

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
