## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0132)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error messages related to web
workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy,
which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox. When combined with other
vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security implications.
(CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly handled window
objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain security
checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 24.3.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 24.3.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0133)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled error messages related to
web workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
policy, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird. When combined with
other vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security
implications. (CVE-2014-1479)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly handled
window objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain
security checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lonnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.3.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.3.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2858-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff
February 10, 2014                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1477 CVE-2014-1479 CVE-2014-1481 CVE-2014-1482
                 CVE-2014-1486 CVE-2014-1487 CVE-2014-1490 CVE-2014-1491

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees, too-verbose error messages and missing permission checks
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
checks or information disclosure. This update also addresses security
issues in the bundled version of the NSS crypto library.

This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR24 series of Firefox.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.3.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060945#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 01:57:39 UTC  ``` Security researcher Arthur Gerkis, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, reported a use-after-free during image processing from sites with specific content types in concert with the imgRequestProxy function. This causes a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-08.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060945#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 19:58:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0133 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0133.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1060945#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 20:17:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0132.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Details

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen and Sotaro Ikeda

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user

had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Thunderbird. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to steal confidential information.

([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))

Fabián Cuchietti and Ateeq ur Rehman Khan discovered that it was possible

to bypass Javascript execution restrictions when replying to or forwarding

mail messages in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to steal confidential information or modify message content.

([CVE-2013-6674](/security/CVE-2013-6674))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-08

## Use-after-free with imgRequestProxy and image proccessing

Announced
February 4, 2014
Reporter
Arthur Gerkis
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 27
* Firefox ESR 24.3
* SeaMonkey 2.24
* Thunderbird 24.3

### Description

Security researcher **Arthur Gerkis**, via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative, reported a use-after-free during image processing from sites
with specific content types in concert with the `imgRequestProxy`
function. This causes a potentially exploitable crash.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060947#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-02-04 01:59:26 UTC  ``` Security researcher Masato Kinugawa reported a cross-origin information leak through web workers' error messages. This violates same-origin policy and the leaked information could potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from third-party websites.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled in mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-09.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Masato Kinugawa as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060947#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 19:58:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0133 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0133.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1060947#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-04 20:17:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0132.html>   ``` |  |

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Core
Shared components used by Firefox and other Mozilla software, including handling of Web content; Gecko, HTML, CSS, layout, DOM, scripts, images, networking, etc. Issues with web page layout probably go here, while Firefox user interface issues belong in the [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox) product.

[Component:](/describecomponents.cgi?product=Core&component=Graphics%3A%20ImageLib#Graphics%3A%20ImageLib)

Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

ZDI-CAN-2036: Mozilla Firefox imgRequestProxy Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS -----------------------------------------
6.8, AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
-- ABSTRACT -------------------------------------
HP's Zero Day Initiative has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS ------------------------
Flaw exists in image processing when source is set by server with content-type
"multipart/x-mixed-replace". When new image is getting loaded, new
imgRequestProxy object gets allocated by imgLoader::CreateNewProxyForRequest():
C:\mozilla-build\mozilla-central\image\src\imgLoader.cpp:644
------------------------------------------------------------
nsresult imgLoader::CreateNewProxyForRequest(imgRequest \*aRequest, nsILoadGroup \*aLoadGroup,
imgINotificationObserver \*aObserver,
nsLoadFlags aLoadFlags, imgRequestProxy \*\*\_retval)
{
LOG\_SCOPE\_WITH\_PARAM(GetImgLog(), "imgLoader::CreateNewProxyForRequest", "imgRequest", aRequest);
/\* XXX If we move decoding onto separate threads, we should save off the
calling thread here and pass it off to |proxyRequest| so that it call
proxy calls to |aObserver|.
\*/
imgRequestProxy \*proxyRequest = new imgRequestProxy();
NS\_ADDREF(proxyRequest);

In frame Nr.4 one can see nsDocument::MaybePreLoadImage() call:
C:\mozilla-build\mozilla-central\content\base\src\nsDocument.cpp:8477
---------------------------------------------------------------------
void
nsDocument::MaybePreLoadImage(nsIURI\* uri, const nsAString &amp;aCrossOriginAttr)
{
// Early exit if the img is already present in the img-cache
// which indicates that the "real" load has already started and
// that we shouldn't preload it.
int16\_t blockingStatus;
if (nsContentUtils::IsImageInCache(uri, static\_cast<nsIDocument \*>(this)) ||
!nsContentUtils::CanLoadImage(uri, static\_cast<nsIDocument \*>(this),
this, NodePrincipal(), &amp;blockingStatus)) {
return;
}
nsLoadFlags loadFlags = nsIRequest::LOAD\_NORMAL;
switch (Element::StringToCORSMode(aCrossOriginAttr)) {
case CORS\_NONE:
// Nothing to do
break;
case CORS\_ANONYMOUS:
loadFlags |= imgILoader::LOAD\_CORS\_ANONYMOUS;
break;
case CORS\_USE\_CREDENTIALS:
loadFlags |= imgILoader::LOAD\_CORS\_USE\_CREDENTIALS;
break;
default:
MOZ\_CRASH("Unknown CORS mode!");
}
// Image not in cache - trigger preload
nsRefPtr<imgRequestProxy> request;
nsresult rv =
nsContentUtils::LoadImage(uri,
this,
NodePrincipal(),
mDocumentURI, // uri of document used as referrer
nullptr, // no observer
loadFlags,
getter\_AddRefs(request));
// Pin image-reference to avoid evicting it from the img-cache before
// the "real" load occurs. Unpinned in DispatchContentLoadedEvents and
// unlink
if (NS\_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
mPreloadingImages.AppendObject(request);
}
}
...
This will save reference to imgRequestProxy object in mPreloadingImages. After
image has loaded nsDocument::DispatchContentLoadedEvents() will be called:
C:\mozilla-build\mozilla-central\content\base\src\nsDocument.cpp:4611
---------------------------------------------------------------------
void
nsDocument::DispatchContentLoadedEvents()
{
// If you add early returns from this method, make sure you're
// calling UnblockOnload properly.
// Unpin references to preloaded images
mPreloadingImages.Clear();
...
This will call imgRequestProxy::Release() and imgRequestProxy object will be
freed:
C:\mozilla-build\mozilla-central\image\src\imgRequestProxy.cpp:94
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NS\_IMPL\_RELEASE(imgRequestProxy)

Though after imgRequestProxy is freed, another imgStatusTracker::SyncNotifyState()
call will use already freed imgRequestProxy object.
Triggering the bug is a bit hard, as it requires refreshing a lot of times.

An easy workaround would be to make mConsumers contain nsRefPtr<imgRequestProxy> instead of imgRequestProxy\*. However, imgRequestProxy's destructor attempts to remove itself from the owner's consumers array, so we appear to have some ownership semantics mismatch happening.

Yes, just run python server and point browser to <http://127.0.0.1/start>, Firefox should crash then.

This seems to be occurring because in imgRequest::OnDataAvailable, when we resniff the mime type we create a new imgStatusTracker and adopt its consumers. All further operations on the imgRequest (such as adding and removing consumers) correctly see the new status tracker, but something is holding on to the old one and its consumers never change after this point.Assignee: nobody → josh

Attached patch

[Refcount imgRequest consumers.](attachment.cgi?id=8341940&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8341940&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=942164&attachment=8341940)

The issue here is that the old Image that gets replaced in imgRequest retains the old status tracker, which in turn contains outdated consumers. I tried two other ways of attacking this: 1) adding a Reset method to imgStatusTracker and not replacing it with a new pointer, but this caused a number of assertion failures that I was not confident of solving correctly, 2) updating the old status tracker pointer in all the places I could find, but this also caused an assertion failure that suggested that I was breaking some invariants I didn't understand. Making mConsumers store refcounted pointers seems like the easiest, most correct way to fix this problem.

I'm always a bit fearful of changing ownership strength like this (since code may implicitly depend on it to not leak), but I went through the relevant code and I can't see a problem.
This makes me very happy, since I'd prefer to use smart pointers where we can. Do you happen to remember why the code was written to use raw pointers originally?

It was like that before I got involved with imagelib in [bug 505385](/show_bug.cgi?id=505385 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor Imagelib notifications"), so I can't really comment.

In terms of who lands it, the developer usually lands the patch on mozilla-central. It is also their responsibility to land it on branches, but RyanVM usually graciously lands patches to branches when the checkin-needed keyword is set. In terms of which branches, presumably everything except release. Al will tell you when. We're very early in the cycle, so probably not for a week or two.

You'll have to get aurora and beta and whatever else approval for the patch, after it lands on trunk, for backporting, though sometimes Al will set the + for those directly.

Refcount imgRequest consumers.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not easily. The underlying lifetime problem is clear, but how to take advantage of it is quite obscure (and not visible in this patch).
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Backporting should be straightforward.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Unlikely to cause regressions.

Refcount imgRequest consumers.
sec-approval+ for trunk. We'll want Aurora, Beta, and ESR24 patches once this lands there as well.
What can we do about getting this onto B2G 1.2 as well?

I`m trying to reproduce the crash in the nightly from 2013-11-22 in order to verify the fix but I am stuck.
I started a server with python using "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" then launched in Firefox "<http://127.0.0.1:port/folder>" - folder is the file where I extracted the content from ZDI-CAN-2036.zip.
If I hit threaded.py FF opens the content of the file and if I hit poc.html I get a blank page with a missing image but no crash.
Is there something I`m missing or doing wrong?Flags: needinfo?(ax330d)

You should start only threaded.py - when requesting "<http://127.0.0.1/start>" from browser, it will serve "poc.html" page and this page will make another request from image, source named "multi" (last request will be served from the same threaded.py server too).Flags: needinfo?(ax330d)

## Details

USN-2102-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced a

regression which could make Firefox crash under some circumstances. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric

Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book,

Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David

Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety

issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1477](/security/CVE-2014-1477),

[CVE-2014-1478](/security/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](/security/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a

security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](/security/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik Lönnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](/security/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint

and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation.

([CVE-2014-1483](/security/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not

handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially

resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances

([CVE-2014-1485](/security/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](/security/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker

error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal

confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](/security/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the

default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session

restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](/security/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers

running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](/security/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker

could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass

cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1490](/security/CVE-2014-1490), [CVE-2014-1491](/security/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects

could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](/security/CVE-2014-1481))
