Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-1757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office software handles memory allocation when converting specially crafted, binary-formatted Word documents (.doc) to newer file formats. Specifically, the software does not properly allocate memory during this conversion process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Office file format converter, which is used to convert legacy Microsoft Office documents into newer file formats.
- Improper memory allocation during the conversion process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the malicious document.
-   If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control over the affected system, allowing them to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted document as an email attachment, and if the user opens it with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office, the exploit is triggered.
-   **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website with a specially crafted file. If a user is convinced to visit the website and open the file, the exploit is triggered. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could also be used for this type of attack.
-   **MOICE (Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment):** An attacker can send a specially crafted file to the user, and if they are convinced to convert it using MOICE, the exploit is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted .doc file that exploits the memory allocation vulnerability.
-   The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office.
-   The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is not automatically exploited through email. User interaction is required to open the malicious attachment.
* The Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
* MOICE does not mitigate this vulnerability.

The provided content also mentions two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2014-1758 and CVE-2014-1761, which are related to how Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files and RTF memory corruption, respectively, but these are separate issues from CVE-2014-1757.
