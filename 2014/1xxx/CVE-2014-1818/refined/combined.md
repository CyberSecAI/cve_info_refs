## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Graphics Component Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2967487)

Published: June 10, 2014 | Updated: August 12, 2014

**Version:** 2.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Lync. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted file or webpage. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows, Microsoft Live Meeting 2007, Microsoft Lync 2010, and Microsoft Lync 2013. It is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way Windows handles certain specially crafted files and by correcting the way GDI+ validates specially crafted image record types. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â  Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ for Microsoft Windows

**There are multiple updates listed for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Do I need to install all the updates?**

No. Depending on how your system is configured to receive updates, only two of the updates for Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 will apply.

For systems running Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2:

* Updates 2964736 and 2964718 are for systems that already have the 2919355 (Windows 8.1 Update) update installed.
* Updates 2965155 and 2965161 are for systems without the 2919355 update installed. Note that the 2965155 and 2965161 updates are only available for customers managing updates using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Windows Intune, or System Center Configuration Manager.

**For Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Window RT 8.1 are there any prerequisites for the 2964736 and 2964718 updates?**

Yes. Customers running Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1 must first install the 2919355 (Windows 8.1 Update) update released in April, 2014 before installing either the 2964736 or the 2964718 update. For more information about the prerequisite update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355)

**There are multiple update packages available for Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their system.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of Windows software can be applied in any sequence.

**Why are multiple update packages available for some affected software?**

Multiple update packages are available for affected versions of Microsoft Windows because the vulnerabilities affect more than one Windows component. There may be more than one update you need to install for a particular vulnerability.

## Update FAQ for Microsoft Office

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 12, 2014?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to announce the offering of update 2881071 on Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2. Update 2881071 replaces update 2767915, and addresses an issue in update 2767915 that caused the update to fail or only partially install on some specific editions of Microsoft Office 2010. Customers who already installed the original update will be offered the 2881071 update and are encouraged to apply it at the earliest opportunity.

**Why are multiple update packages available for some affected software?**

The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different updates packages as indicated in the **Affected Software** table because the vulnerabilities affect more than one Office component.

**There are multiple update packages available for some affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their system.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of Office software can be applied in any sequence.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335). For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not vulnerable. Why am I being offered this update?**

In some cases, an update may apply to Microsoft Office products that are specifically listed in the Non-Affected Software table or that are otherwise listed in the Affected Software table with "Not applicable" for security impact. For example, you may be offered a Microsoft Office security update even though this security bulletin indicates that the Office products or the version of the Office products that you do have installed are not affected. For more information on this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**I am running Office 2010, which is listed as affected software. Why am I not being offered the 2863942 update?**

The 2863942 update will only be offered to systems that are running Microsoft Office 2010 on supported editions of Windows Server 2003. The update is not applicable to other supported configurations because the vulnerable code is not present.

## Update FAQ for Microsoft Lync

**MS14-036 and MS14-032 address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Lync. Are the security updates in the two bulletins related?**
No. The security updates in MS14-036 and MS14-032 are not related. Customers should install the updates in both bulletins for the software installed on their systems.

**I do not have Microsoft Lync 2013 software installed. Why am I being offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013?**

You may be offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013 even though you do not have the affected software installed, if you have Microsoft Office software that contains the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office 2013 and Microsoft Lync 2013. Note that because the software does not access the vulnerable code, the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**Does this update contain any non-security related changes to functionality?**

Yes, in addition to changes described in the vulnerability information, the update for Microsoft Live Meeting Console requires the following non-security updates:

* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (32-bit) (2968967)
* OCS Conferencing Addin for Outlook (64-bit) (2968967)

See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2968967](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2968967) for more information.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software constitute an issue in the servicing model for Microsoft Office updates?**

No. The servicing model is based on how the update applies to shared components of Microsoft Office software. Some of the products offered an update may not access the vulnerable code, and thus the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a product version for applicable software on the system that is within the range of product versions that the update applies to, and thus offers the update. This helps to maintain consistency for shared files across Office products.

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

## Unicode Scripts Processor Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1817

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle specially crafted font files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted file or webpage. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1817](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1817).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient service** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **Startup type** to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.**Â When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient service** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **Startup type** to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, TCP and UDP Port Assignments.

  Impact of workaround. Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

  Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents scripted content from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Windows fails to properly handle specially crafted files in a way that corrupts memory and allows for arbitrary code to be executed.

**What is the Unicode Script Processor?**

The Unicode Script Processor (usp10.dll), also known as Uniscribe, is a collection of APIs that enables a text layout client to format complex scripts. Uniscribe supports the complex rules found in scripts such as Arabic, Indian, and Thai. Uniscribe also handles scripts written from right-to-left such as Arabic or Hebrew, and supports the mixing of scripts. For plain-text clients, Uniscribe provides a range of ScriptString functions that are similar to TextOut, with additional support for caret placement. The remainder of the Uniscribe interfaces provides finer control to clients.

**What is GDI+?**

GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Windows handles certain specially crafted files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability has been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ Image Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1818

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ handles validation of specially crafted images. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted image. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1818](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1818).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry** Customers using Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Window 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To modify the key, follow these steps:

  **Warning**: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Note**: After you change a registry entry, you must restart your system.

  1. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE\_Initialize
  2. Create a **DWORD** value for disabling metafiles by creating a registry entry (**DWORD** value) under the GRE\_Initialize subkey: **DisableMetaFiles**
  3. To disable metafiles processing, set the value of **DisableMetaFiles** registry entry to **1**.

  **Impact of Workaround**: Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the appearance of the output from software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause software or system components to fail completely. This workaround has been identified to have a potentially significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  To re-enable metafiles processing, set the value of the **DisableMetaFiles** registry entry to **0**.
* **Disable data collaboration in Lync** Enterprise users who manage directly a Lync server can prevent PowerPoint files (which may be used as an attack vector to send specially crafted PowerPoint files) from being shared through Lync by using the Lync Server Control Panel to modify the Lync conferencing policy for data collaboration.

  **For Lync 2010 and Lync 2013:**

  1. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  3. In the list of conferencing policies, click **Data collaboration**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.
  4. To prevent data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **None**. The default setting is **Enable data collaboration**.
  5. Click **Commit**.

  **Impact of workaround.**Â Users will not be able to share and collaborate on PowerPoint files, polls, and Whiteboard during Lync meetings.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. To re-enable data collaboration:
  2. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  3. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  4. In the list of conferencing policies, click Data collaboration, click Edit, and then click **Show details**.
  5. To enable data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **Enable data collaboration**.
  6. Click **Commit**.
* **Read emails in plain text** Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2010 provide an option for reading email messages in plain text format. For more information about the Read all standard mail in plain text option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607).

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view email messages that are not digitally signed or email messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed email messages or encrypted email messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround**. Email messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
