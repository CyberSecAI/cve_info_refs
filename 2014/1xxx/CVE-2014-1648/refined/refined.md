The provided content is related to CVE-2014-1648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation of the `displayTab` parameter in the `/brightmail/setting/compliance/DlpConnectFlow$view.flo` page within the Symantec Messaging Gateway Management Console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted user's browser.
- This allows the attacker to perform actions within the context of the victim user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL, where the `displayTab` parameter is used to inject malicious script code.
- The malicious payload is reflected back in the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker must then trick a victim into accessing this crafted URL, likely through a phishing or other social engineering attack.
