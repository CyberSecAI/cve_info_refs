  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation of user-supplied data leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands in the application's database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET parameter 'search' in '/index.php'",
        "HTTP headers: 'CLIENT_IP', 'X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'X_FORWARDED', 'FORWARDED_FOR', 'FORWARDED' in '/index.php'"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated and be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.",
     "details": "The vulnerability is present in AuraCMS 2.3 and earlier. Specifically, the `search` parameter in the `/index.php` script and the `CLIENT_IP`, `X_FORWARDED_FOR`, `X_FORWARDED`, `FORWARDED_FOR`, or `FORWARDED` HTTP headers in `/index.php` are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. An example provided shows a request to `/index.php` with a crafted `search` parameter, causing the execution of `SELECT version()` showing the MySQL server's version. Similarly, crafted HTTP headers can inject SQL code. The fix involves sanitizing the inputs with `mysqli_real_escape_string`. The patch was applied directly to the source code on January 30, 2014, without version modification."
