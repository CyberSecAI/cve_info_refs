The provided content relates to CVE-2014-1632.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of two issues:
  1. **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The installation script `/setup/index.php` was accessible to remote unauthenticated users, allowing them to re-run the installation process. This script was not removed after the initial installation.
  2. **Code Injection:** Insufficient sanitization of the `hostname` HTTP POST parameter during the installation process in `/config/config.php` allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. This requires providing the address of an attacker-controlled MySQL server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-276:** Incorrect Default Permissions
- **CWE-94:** Improper sanitization leading to Code Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Reinstallation and Compromise:** An attacker can re-install the Eventum application due to the accessible installation script.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This allows for a complete compromise of the system.
- **Backdoor Injection:** The attacker can inject a backdoor into the `/config/config.php` file.
- **Full System Access:**  By controlling the database connection, the attacker can perform operations as needed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** Both vulnerabilities can be exploited by a remote attacker without any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Eventum server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No login credentials or prior access is needed.
- **Database Access (for code injection):** The attacker needs to provide the address of their own malicious MySQL server in order to trigger the code injection.
