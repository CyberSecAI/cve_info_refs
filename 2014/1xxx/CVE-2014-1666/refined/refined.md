Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-1666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `do_physdev_op` function in Xen does not properly restrict access to the `PHYSDEVOP_prepare_msix` and `PHYSDEVOP_release_msix` operations. These operations are intended for privileged guests (like domain 0) but are accessible to unprivileged PV guests due to a missing privilege check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for the specified physical device operations, allowing unauthorized access from unprivileged PV guest domains.
- **Missing Privilege Check:** The code that should have checked if the guest had sufficient privileges to perform `PHYSDEVOP_prepare_msix` and `PHYSDEVOP_release_msix` was missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious unprivileged guests can cause the host or other guests to malfunction. This can result in a host-wide denial of service.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although deemed unlikely, the possibility of privilege escalation cannot be entirely excluded.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local PV Guest Exploitation:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by malicious or misbehaving unprivileged PV (Paravirtualized) guests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have control over an unprivileged PV guest running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- **Knowledge of Hypercalls:** The attacker needs to be able to make use of the vulnerable hypercalls.

**Vulnerable Systems:**
- Xen versions 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, and 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x are affected.
- Xen versions 4.2.1, 4.2.0, 4.1.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.
- Only PV guests can exploit this vulnerability. HVM guests are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Running only HVM guests will avoid the vulnerability.
- For PV guests, applying the appropriate patches is the only resolution.

**Patch Information:**
- Patches are available to correct the access control issue by adding a privilege check. The patch names are `xsa87-4.1.patch`, `xsa87-4.2.patch`, and `xsa87-unstable-4.3.patch` for the respective Xen versions.

The provided information is more detailed than the description in the original CVE entry, providing the exact vulnerable functions, the nature of the vulnerability (missing privilege check), and the attack vector (local PV guests).
