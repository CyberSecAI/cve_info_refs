An update that solves 10 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 2 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset has been updated to fix various
security issues and several bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-88: CVE-2014-1950: Use-after-free vulnerability
in the xc\_cpupool\_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through
4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc\_cpumap\_alloc function,
which allows local users with access to management
functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption)
and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#861256)
\*
XSA-87: CVE-2014-1666: The do\_physdev\_op function in
Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not
properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP\_prepare\_msix
and (2) PHYSDEVOP\_release\_msix operations, which allows
local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest
malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#860302)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* Boot Failure with xen kernel in UEFI mode with error
"No memory for trampoline" (bnc#833483)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic on 8-blades nPar with
46-bit memory addressing. (bnc#848014)
\* In HP's UEFI x86\_64 platform and sles11sp3 with xen
environment, dom0 will soft lockup on multiple blades nPar.
(bnc#842417)
\* Soft lockup with PCI passthrough and many VCPUs
(bnc#846849)

An update that solves 12 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 3 Xen
hypervisor and toolset has been updated to 4.2.4 to fix
various bugs and security issues:
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-80: CVE-2013-6400: Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when
using Intel VT-d and a PCI device has been assigned, does
not clear the flag that suppresses IOMMU TLB flushes when
unspecified errors occur, which causes the TLB entries to
not be flushed and allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host crash) or gain privileges
via unspecified vectors. (bnc#853048)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-83: CVE-2014-1642: The IRQ setup in Xen 4.2.x and
4.3.x, when using device passthrough and configured to
support a large number of CPUs, frees certain memory that
may still be intended for use, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and hypervisor crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via vectors related to an out-of-memory
error that triggers a (1) use-after-free or (2) double
free. (bnc#860092)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-85: CVE-2014-1895: The FLASK\_AVC\_CACHESTAT
hypercall, which provides access to per-cpu statistics on
the Flask security policy, incorrectly validates the CPU
for which statistics are being requested. (bnc#860165)
\*
XSA-86: CVE-2014-1896: libvchan (a library for
inter-domain communication) does not correctly handle
unusual or malicious contents in the xenstore ring. A
malicious guest can exploit this to cause a libvchan-using
facility to read or write past the end of the ring.
(bnc#860300)
\*
XSA-87: CVE-2014-1666: The do\_physdev\_op function in
Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not
properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP\_prepare\_msix
and (2) PHYSDEVOP\_release\_msix operations, which allows
local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest
malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#860302)
\*
XSA-88: CVE-2014-1950: Use-after-free vulnerability
in the xc\_cpupool\_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through
4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not
properly handle a failure by the xc\_cpumap\_alloc function,
which allows local users with access to management
functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption)
and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#861256)
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* Fixed boot problems with Xen kernel. "(XEN) setup
0000:00:18.0 for d0 failed (-19)" (bnc#858311)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic on 8-blades nPar with
46-bit memory addressing. (bnc#848014)
\* Fixed Xen hypervisor panic in HP's UEFI x86\_64
platform and with xen environment, in booting stage.
(bnc#833251)
\* xend/pvscsi: recognize also SCSI CDROM devices
(bnc#863297)
\* pygrub: Support (/dev/xvda) style disk specifications

             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-1666 / XSA-87
                              version 2

     PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix exposed to unprivileged guests

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix operations are supposed to be available
to privileged guests (domain 0 in non-disaggregated setups) only, but the
necessary privilege check was missing.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or misbehaving unprivileged guests can cause the host or other
guests to malfunction. This can result in host-wide denial of service.
Privilege escalation, while seeming to be unlikely, cannot be excluded.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.1.5 and 4.1.6.1 as well as 4.2.2 and later are vulnerable.
Xen 4.2.1 and 4.2.0 as well as 4.1.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.

Only PV guests can take advantage of this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests will avoid this issue.

There is no mitigation available for PV guests.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was disclosed publicly on the xen-devel mailing list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
