  "CVE-2014-1446": {
    "description": "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's hamradio YAM driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "linux",
      "linux-ec2",
       "linux-ti-omap4",
      "linux-lts-saucy",

      "linux-lts-quantal"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `yam_ioctl()` code in the hamradio YAM driver for AX.25 packet radio fails to initialize the `cmd` field of the `struct yamdrv_ioctl_cfg` before filling the structure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "A local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can read 4 bytes of uninitialized kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information.",
      "attack_vector": "Local exploitation by invoking the SIOCYAMGCFG ioctl call.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability."
    },
        "patch": "The vulnerability is resolved by adding an explicit `memset(0)` before filling the structure to avoid the 4-byte info leak."
