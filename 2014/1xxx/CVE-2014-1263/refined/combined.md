How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>
  + **WARNING –** take special care to note the known issues with HA upgrades: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha_notes.html#known-issues>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

Interestingly, this does not work for mismatched hostnames – <https://213.133.107.227.xip.io/> fails even though <https://213.133.107.227/> is accepted. I'm now somewhat curious as to what could have produced that particular failure mode but presumably it wasn't noticed because Safari does its own checks and the QA team obviously doesn't test either this case or the lower-level OpenSSL functions directly.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I wish I could say sitting on it for a year was surprising but I've reported three MITM bugs to Apple and each of them took around a year to be fixed. Obviously nothing has changed since 2004.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Chef Server 11.0.12 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Chef Server 11.0.12 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Chef Server should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be understated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Chef Server install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Chef Server, visit <https://www.getchef.com/chef/install>

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_open_source.html#upgrade-to-newer-versions-of-chef-server-11>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/open_source/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Chef Server install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Chef Server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Security Fixes

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Chef Server 11.0.11:

* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)
* [libcurl] Patch for address wildcard certificate validation (CVE-2014-0139)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl (CVE-2014-1563)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Winssl (CVE-2014-2522)
* [openssl] Patch for heartbeat extension exposing process memory (CVE-2014-0160)
* [libyaml] Patch for arbitrary code execution vulnerability (CVE-2014-2525)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Bug Fixes:

The following bug fixes have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [private-chef-cookbooks] Provide default value for jetty log path to fix dotfile deletion bug.
* [private-chef-ctl] private-chef-ctl password fixed to work correctly after a regression introduced in EC 1.4.6.
* [private-chef-cookbooks] Manage /var/log/opscode permissions even with non 0022 umask.
