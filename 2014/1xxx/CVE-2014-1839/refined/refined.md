Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-1839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `tempfile.mktemp()` in the `Execute` class within the `shellutils.py` module of the `logilab-common` Python library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** `tempfile.mktemp()` is known to be unsafe. It generates a temporary filename, but does not create the file. This allows for a race condition where an attacker can create the file before the application does.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  By pre-creating the temporary file, an attacker can potentially manipulate the files created by the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description notes an "unspecified impact" but the detailed information indicates the potential for arbitrary file manipulation, which can have various effects depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **File Pre-creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a file with the name that `tempfile.mktemp` is about to generate before the vulnerable application does. This can be achieved via a race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.
*   The attacker needs the ability to predict or quickly determine the name of the temporary file generated by `mktemp` before the vulnerable code does.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create files in the system's temporary directory (/tmp in this case).

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information indicates that the vulnerability is related to insecure use of `/tmp` directory.
* The issue has been fixed in `logilab-common` version 0.61.0 and later.
* The vulnerability was addressed in openSUSE via security update `openSUSE-SU-2014:0306-1`.
* Debian assigned the bug number 737051 to track this issue.
* The issue was tracked upstream as <http://www.logilab.org/ticket/207562>
