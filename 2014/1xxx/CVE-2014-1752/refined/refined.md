Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption. This corruption can be exploited to gain control of the application's execution flow.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the user currently logged into the system. This could lead to full system control if the user has administrative rights.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers host specially crafted web pages designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may inject malicious content into compromised websites, or websites that accept/host user-provided content or ads.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious web pages. This can be done through phishing emails, instant messages, or malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Hosting a Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to host a website that contains the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious site.
- **No User Interaction (beyond browsing):** The vulnerability can be triggered simply by visiting the malicious website if the system is not patched.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-018, which includes a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer (2950467).
- The update addresses the memory corruption by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This vulnerability affected multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 11) on Windows clients and servers.
- The severity is rated as Critical for client systems and Moderate for server systems.
- The bulletin also mentions the use of EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) as a way to help mitigate the exploitation attempts.
- Palo Alto Networks is credited for reporting this vulnerability.
