Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1419:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `acpi-support` package incorrectly handled certain privileged operations when checking for power management daemons. Specifically, the `policy-funcs` script was vulnerable.
*   An unprivileged user could inject the `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable, leading to arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
*   The vulnerability stemmed from the script using the user from an arbitrary `kded4` process instead of the X console user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is a privilege escalation, allowing a local user to gain root access.
*   **Race Condition:**  Although not explicitly described as a race condition, the vulnerability involves the timing of the execution and the environment variables used, which is a component of a race condition, and the bug report mentions "root escalation via race".
*   **Insecure Environment Variable Handling:** The scripts did not properly sanitize or validate environment variables like `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, allowing for injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Gaining root access enables the attacker to compromise the entire system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have a user account on the target system.
*   **Environment Variable Injection:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting the `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:**  The attacker must have a local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Environment Variables:** The attacker needs to be able to set environment variables that are used by the vulnerable script.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `acpi-support` versions prior to `0.140.2` for Ubuntu Precise.
*   Versions `0.142` and later of acpi-support dropped the vulnerable script making Saucy and higher versions not vulnerable.
*   The fix involves using the X console user instead of relying on an arbitrary `kded4` process.
*   The fix also includes sourcing `/usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs` in `power.sh`.
*   A coordinated release date (CRD) was set to ensure coordinated patching between Ubuntu and Debian.
*   Patches were released for Ubuntu Precise, and the vulnerability was marked as "Fix Released" after updates were made.
*   Debian also released a fix for this vulnerability in version `0.140-5+deb7u1` for stable (wheezy) and `0.142-2` for testing and unstable.
