How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In the experimental, never-enabled JPAKE code: clear returned digest and
length in hash_buffer() for error cases; could lead to memory corruption
later if EVP_Digest* fails.  Pointed out by Mark Dowd

As I understand it this can be enabled via code edit/gcc command line
options, so not sure if this qualified for a CVE or not (vuln in code,
yes, is code reachable? not under any default setup, and even on
non-default you have to go pretty far off to enable it).

Use CVE-2014-1692. The CVE description will indicate that the issue
requires an unusual installation.

An impact on the default installation isn't necessary. Vulnerabilities
that occur only after the user modifies code aren't eligible for a
CVE. However, if there's some type of "installation option" mentioned
by the vendor, someone may have chosen that option, and it may be
worthwhile to track the issue with a CVE. The nature of an
"installation option" obviously varies widely across both open-source
and closed-source products.

In this case, there's:

> <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc>

> Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication
> method using the J-PAKE protocol ...

> This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently
> compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).

> <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc?rev=1.41;content-type=text%2Fplain>

> #CFLAGS+=	-DJPAKE

This is close to the edge of what "installation option" means, but our
feeling is that the vendor wouldn't have provided that #CFLAGS line at
all unless it were expected that an end user might want to make the
one-character change.
