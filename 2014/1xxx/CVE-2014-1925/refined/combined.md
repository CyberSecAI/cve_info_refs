Subject: CVE request: multiple issues in Koha

Hi,

As current release manager for Koha, I'd like to request CVE number(s)
for the following issues that were addressed in a security release
yesterday.

Release announcement:

<http://koha-community.org/security-release-february-2014/>

Issues fixed with the release:

[1] tools/pdfViewer.pl could be used to read arbitrary files on the server
(<http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11660>)
[2] the staff interface help editor could be used to modify or create
arbitrary files on the server
(<http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11661>)
[3] member-picupload.pl could be used to write to arbitrary files on the server
(<http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11662>)
[4] the MARC framework import/export function did not require
authentication, and could be used to perform unexpected SQL commands
(<http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11666>)

Regards,

Galen

issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=11666#c0)  John Lightsey    2014-02-03 00:04:41 UTC  ``` This interface doesn't require authentication and allows SQL to be injected into the system. The limitation is that the SQL statements must match  $line =~ /^\s*(?i:DELETE\s+FROM|INSERT\s+INTO)\s+(?:marc_tag_structure|marc_subfield_structure)/  and  $line =~ /'$frameworkcode'/ ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=11666#c1)  Galen Charlton    2014-02-03 21:29:39 UTC  ``` I've confirmed both parts of the bug.  I'm not sure that I see a way to get DML through, since we're not doing mysql_multi_statements, but INSERT INTO marc_subfield_structure ... SELECT FROM... would provide a way for an attacker to get the contents of arbitrary rows from any table in the Koha database.  Serious consideration should be given to simply dropping exporting and importing the frameworks as SQL -- we can find somebody to maintain CSV versions of the stock ones for the website. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=11666#c3)  Galen Charlton    2014-02-04 16:05:27 UTC  ``` I've attached a patch that fixes the lacked of authentication.  Not setting the status to needs signoff yet because the second part of the bug is not yet tackled, but anybody should feel free to review the first patch. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=11666#c12)  Galen Charlton    2014-02-07 01:43:21 UTC  ``` Pushed to master. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=11666#c13)  Galen Charlton    2014-02-07 02:05:57 UTC  ``` Included in the following releases: 3.8.23, 3.10.13, 3.12.10, and 3.14.3. ``` |  |

# Security release — February 2014

[Galen Charlton](https://koha-community.org/author/gmcharlt/ "View all posts by Galen Charlton")

Posted on [Friday February 7th, 2014](https://koha-community.org/security-release-february-2014/ "Security release — February 2014")
Posted in [3.10](https://koha-community.org/category/release/3-10/), [3.12](https://koha-community.org/category/release/3-12/), [3.14](https://koha-community.org/category/release/3-14/), [3.8](https://koha-community.org/category/release/3-8/), [Koha](https://koha-community.org/category/koha/), [release](https://koha-community.org/category/release/), [security](https://koha-community.org/category/security/)

Tagged with [Koha News](https://koha-community.org/tag/koha-news/)

The Koha community is releasing a security update for all supported and recent unsupported versions of Koha. The security update is available in the following new releases being made today:

* 3.14.3
* 3.12.10
* 3.10.13
* 3.8.23

The following security bugs are fixed by this update:

* [Bug 11660](http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11660): tools/pdfViewer.pl could be used to read arbitrary files on the server
* [Bug 11661](http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11661): the staff interface help editor could be used to modify or create arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the Apache user
* [Bug 11662](http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11662): member-picupload.pl could be used to write to arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the Apache user
* [Bug 11666](http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=11666): the MARC framework import/export function did not require authentication, and could be used to perform unexpected SQL commands

The fix for bug 11666 removes SQL as a supported format for importing or exporting MARC frameworks.

We recommend that you upgrade immediately to get the fixes for these security issues. However, if you are not able to perform the upgrade right away, you can mitigate against the issues by performing the following actions:

* deleting the `pdfViewer.pl` script
* deleting the `member-picupload.pl` script
* making `edithelp.pl` not be executable, e.g., by doing `chmod a-x edithelp.pl`
* making `import_export_framework.pl` not be executable, which will disable the MARC framework import and export functionality

Our thanks to John Lightsey for finding and reporting the issues.

The 3.14.3 and 3.10.13 releases also contain unrelated bugfixes which are described in their release notes.

Please note that if you installed from a tarball, you may need to manually delete `pdfViewer.pl` and `member-picupload.pl`, even after you upgrade.

Users of the Debian packages for 3.12.x and 3.14.x (and master) can get the latest release by running `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get upgrade`.

Tarballs are also available:

* [3.14.3](http://download.koha-community.org/koha-3.14.03.tar.gz)
* [3.12.10](http://download.koha-community.org/koha-3.12.10.tar.gz)
* [3.10.13](http://download.koha-community.org/koha-3.10.13.tar.gz)
* [3.8.23](http://download.koha-community.org/old_releases/koha-3.08.23.tar.gz)

If you are not running a version of Koha that has has a release maintainer (currently 3.8.x, 3.10.x, 3.12.x, and 3.14.x), we strongly urge you to upgrade to a supported version.
