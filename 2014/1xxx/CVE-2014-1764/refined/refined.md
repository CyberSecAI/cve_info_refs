Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-1764:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided document directly mentions **CVE-2014-1764** in the "Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers" section and in the "Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer" section. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This allows script to be run with elevated privileges.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core vulnerability is an **Elevation of Privilege (EoP)** issue in Internet Explorer.
*   Specifically, it is due to improper permission validation when script is executed under specific conditions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can lead to an attacker gaining elevated privileges within the context of Internet Explorer.
*   While this vulnerability doesn't directly enable arbitrary code execution, it can be chained with other vulnerabilities (like remote code execution) to run malicious code with elevated permissions (medium integrity level/user rights).
*   An attacker could escalate privileges from running code at a low integrity level (limited permissions) to a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is web-based.
*   Attackers can host malicious websites or compromise existing ones to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Users are typically tricked into visiting these sites via links in emails or instant messages or by opening malicious attachments.
*   Exploitation requires user interaction (clicking a link, opening an attachment).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host or control a web resource to serve the exploit.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious web resource.
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would likely be part of a larger attack chain, as it does not provide arbitrary code execution by itself.
*   The vulnerability impacts Internet Explorer 7 through 11.

**Additional Details:**
*   The document states that Microsoft had not received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited at the time the security bulletin was originally issued.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
*   The document also notes that this vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run but could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution.

In summary, CVE-2014-1764 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer caused by improper permission validation. It requires user interaction, can be used in conjunction with a remote code execution vulnerability to achieve greater impact.
