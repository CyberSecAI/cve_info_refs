Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1604:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `/tmp` directory for storing parser cache files in the `rply` Python library. The library created cache files in `/tmp` with predictable filenames. Since `/tmp` is world-writable, a malicious user could create or modify these cache files, potentially influencing the behavior of other users' programs that use `rply`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure tempfile usage:** The library used `tempfile.gettempdir()` to generate a path within `/tmp`. While using a temp directory is not inherently insecure, the way the cache files were created and accessed in rply made the application vulnerable.
*   **Predictable filenames:** The filenames generated were predictable, using a combination of version number, cache id, and a hash of the grammar. This allowed an attacker to anticipate the name of the cache files.
*   **Lack of file access restrictions:** The files were not created with restrictive permissions, enabling other users to read and modify them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious data into the cache files which will then be loaded by the program. In the example provided, it was shown that an attacker could change the outcome of the tiny calculator program and therefore control program logic.
*   **Data manipulation:** Modification of the cache files can lead to incorrect program execution, data corruption, or other undesirable effects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File system manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file system by placing a malicious cache file in `/tmp`.
*   **Shared environment:** The attack requires that the vulnerable application is run in a shared environment with other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is running and be able to write to `/tmp`.
*   **Knowledge of filename pattern:** The attacker needs to be able to predict the filename to target.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported in Debian bug #735263.
*   The issue was addressed by modifying the filename generation to include the user ID (`os.getuid()`) and setting restrictive file permissions (0o0600), making the cache files accessible only to the creating user.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `fc9bbcd25b0b4f09bbd6339f710ad24c129d5d7c` on GitHub and was included in `rply` version 0.7.1.
*   The fix not only modifies the filename but also sets the file permission to `0600`, which makes it unreadable to any other user.
