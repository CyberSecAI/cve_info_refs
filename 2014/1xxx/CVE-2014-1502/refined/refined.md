  "response": {
    "CVE-2014-1502": {
      "root_cause": "The `WebGL.compressedTex(Sub)Image2D` function does not call `MakeCurrent`, which is necessary for properly setting the current WebGL context when modifying textures.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper context switching in WebGL API.",
         "Missing call to `MakeCurrent`."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious website with WebGL content can inject its own content (textures, etc.) into the WebGL context of another website, causing the target site to render the injected content. This can't steal data but can render arbitrary content, leading to potential UI spoofing or other misleading visuals.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious website that utilizes WebGL.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a webpage with malicious WebGL code. The user needs to visit the malicious website while also having another WebGL-using website open.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when `WebGL.compressedTex(Sub)Image2D` is called without properly setting the current context. The issue is described as not allowing to steal data, but allows to overwrite textures. It was initially considered sec-high, but then downgraded to sec-moderate."
