Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2014-1439:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The content from the HHVM blog and the GitHub commit directly mention CVE-2014-1439 and its fix. The commit message on GitHub also clearly states "Fix libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader()". The vulnerability is related to how `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function in HHVM handled external entity loading in XML parsing.

**2. Root Cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function was not properly implemented. It failed to disable entity loading completely under certain circumstances. Specifically, it wasn't calling `requestInit` and setting the libxml handler to null. This means that the handler could be reset when an error occurred, and external entities would be loaded, even when disabled.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Improper implementation of the `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function.
   - Failure to consistently prevent external entity loading, even after the function was called with the intent of disabling it.
   - This could be exploited by an attacker via specially crafted XML.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - If external entities were not properly disabled, an attacker could potentially perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.
    - XXE attacks could lead to:
        - Disclosure of local files on the server
        - Denial of service
        - Internal port scanning
        - Potentially Remote Code Execution in other scenarios

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is via crafted XML documents containing external entity references. This is through a web service parsing untrusted XML, or where user data is used to construct XML content for further processing.
    - The vulnerability could be exploited by injecting a specially crafted XML document to the application processing XML files.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to supply/influence XML input to an HHVM application that uses the vulnerable `libxml_disable_entity_loader()`.
   - The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server apart from being able to send data to the service, or inject malicious data to the application.

**Additional Details from the GitHub Commit:**
- The fix involves ensuring that `requestInit` is called and that the libxml handler is set to null when entity loading is disabled.
- The commit message indicates that a member boolean, `m_entity_loader_disabled`, is used to track the state of the entity loader, ensuring `requestInit` is always called to set a custom handler when disabling external entities.
- It also sets a custom handler in `requestInit` to prevent entity loading when disabled.

**Additional Details from the HHVM Blog Post:**
- This fix was included in HHVM 2.4.0 and was also backported to 2.3.3
