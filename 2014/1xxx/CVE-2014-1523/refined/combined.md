When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

                 CVE-2014-1530 CVE-2014-1531 CVE-2014-1532

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety
errors, buffer overflows, missing permission checks, out of bound reads,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, cross-site scripting
or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1~deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

## Details

Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij,

Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, John Schoenick, Karl Tomlinson, Vladimir

Vukicevic and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in

Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1518](/security/CVE-2014-1518), [CVE-2014-1519](/security/CVE-2014-1519))

An out of bounds read was discovered in Web Audio. An attacker could

potentially exploit this cause a denial of service via application crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1522](/security/CVE-2014-1522))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1523](/security/CVE-2014-1523))

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL

object as an XBL object. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1524](/security/CVE-2014-1524))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Text Track Manager when

processing HTML video. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause

a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1525](/security/CVE-2014-1525))

Jukka Jylänki discovered an out-of-bounds write in Cairo when working

with canvas in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1528](/security/CVE-2014-1528))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can

run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. An attacker

could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1529](/security/CVE-2014-1529))

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load

a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting or phishing

attacks. ([CVE-2014-1530](/security/CVE-2014-1530))

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some

circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1531](/security/CVE-2014-1531))

Christian Heimes discovered that NSS did not handle IDNA domain prefixes

correctly for wildcard certificates. An attacker could potentially exploit

this by using a specially crafted certificate to conduct a machine-in-the-middle

attack. ([CVE-2014-1492](/security/CVE-2014-1492))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during

host resolution in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1532](/security/CVE-2014-1532))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the debugger bypassed XrayWrappers for some

objects. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website

whilst using the debugger, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2014-1526](/security/CVE-2014-1526))

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0448)

## Topic

An updated firefox package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1518, CVE-2014-1524, CVE-2014-1529, CVE-2014-1531)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox resolved hosts in
certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2014-1532)

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded JPEG
images. Loading a web page containing a specially crafted JPEG image could
cause Firefox to crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled browser navigations through
history. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause the address bar
of the browser to display a web page name while loading content from an
entirely different web page, which could allow for cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary
Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, Christian Holler,
Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Nils, Tyson Smith, and Jesse
Schwartzentrube as the original reporters of these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 24.5.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
Firefox version 24.5.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

The picture does not seem to contain a ICC profile at all.
convert saraamarie-buggy-solidpp-pink.jpg icc:profile.icm && hexdump -C profile.icm
Profiles:

Attached patch

[Check if there is enough data to read uint32 to avoid buffer overflow. Jeff's patch rebased, only iccread.c, carry r=bgirard.](attachment.cgi?id=8404156&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8404156&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=969226&attachment=8404156)

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily, I think.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All. This has been there since 2009.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Trivial rebase for backports.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely. It is a trivial check and all we're doing is avoiding the buffer overflow by avoiding reading data that isn't there. Invalid profile is the correct action in this case.

A fix
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not very easily, I don't think this is exploitable. It's just a fixed offset out of bounds read
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The problem is pretty obvious from the patch, but there's but it feels like it's pretty harmless
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All of them
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Easy
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Very unlikely to cause regressions. It shouldn't need any testing as the patch is pretty obvious.

Check if there is enough data to read uint32 to avoid buffer overflow. Jeff's patch rebased, only iccread.c, carry r=bgirard.
sec-approval+ for trunk.
Once this lands and is green, we'd like to see Aurora, Beta, and ESR24 patches created and nominated for branch landing.

It does not crash Chrome, i had checked before filing it here. Still i just filed <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=362762> so that Noel can double check.

From Noel@ on why it does not reproduce in Chrome.
----------
noel@chromium.org
ImageDecoder.h defines the color profile header length
<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/image-decoders/ImageDecoder.h&l=157>
enum { iccColorProfileHeaderLength = 128 };
The decoders check the header size when reading profile data from an encoded image
<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/image-decoders/png/PNGImageDecoder.cpp&l=284>
<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/image-decoders/jpeg/JPEGImageDecoder.cpp&&l=230>
<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/image-decoders/webp/WEBPImageDecoder.cpp&l=360>
and ignore color profiles with short headers.
So qcms never gets to see such profiles, hence no reproduction.

Looking more, this does not seem exploitable. Length is arbitrary based on value read from memory. Size is < 4. This causes it to run into INVALID\_PROFILE due to the next two checks.
source.size = size;
....
....
length = read\_u32(src, 0);
1027 if (length <= size) {
1028 // shrink the area that we can read if appropriate
1029 source.size = length;
1030 } else {
1031 return INVALID\_PROFILE;
1032 }
1033
1034 /\* ensure that the profile size is sane so it's easier to reason about \*/
1035 if (source.size <= 64 || source.size >= MAX\_PROFILE\_SIZE)
1036 return INVALID\_PROFILE;Flags: needinfo?(inferno)

I'm trying to verify the fix on esr ASAN build as well but while building I am prompted with 'clang-3.4: error: linker command failed with exit code 1' error and I can't bypass it. Can someone help me on this or if someone has successfully build latest ESR give me access to a build?

Package        : iceweasel
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1518 CVE-2014-1523 CVE-2014-1524 CVE-2014-1529
                 CVE-2014-1530 CVE-2014-1531 CVE-2014-1532

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows, missing permission checks, out of bound reads,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, cross-site scripting
or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.5.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1092663#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-04-29 16:57:02 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL object as an XBL object because the XBL status of the object is not properly validated. The resulting memory corruption is potentially exploitable.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-38.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Abhishek Arya as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1092663#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-29 22:15:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0449 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0449.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1092663#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-04-29 22:46:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0448 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0448.html>   ``` |  |

This is also a mozilla-nss update to version 3.16:
\* required for Firefox 29
\* bmo#903885 - (CVE-2014-1492) In a wildcard certificate,
the wildcard character should not be embedded within
the U-label of an internationalized domain name. See
the last bullet point in RFC 6125, Section 7.2.
\* Supports the Linux x32 ABI. To build for the Linux x32
target, set the environment variable USE\_X32=1 when
building NSS. New Functions:
\* NSS\_CMSSignerInfo\_Verify New Macros
\* TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_RC4\_128\_SHA,
TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, etc., cipher suites that
were first defined in SSL 3.0 can now be referred to
with their official IANA names in TLS, with the TLS\_
prefix. Previously, they had to be referred to with
their names in SSL 3.0, with the SSL\_ prefix. Notable
Changes:
\* ECC is enabled by default. It is no longer necessary to
set the environment variable NSS\_ENABLE\_ECC=1 when
building NSS. To disable ECC, set the environment
variable NSS\_DISABLE\_ECC=1 when building NSS.
\* libpkix should not include the common name of CA as DNS
names when evaluating name constraints.
\* AESKeyWrap\_Decrypt should not return SECSuccess for
invalid keys.
\* Fix a memory corruption in sec\_pkcs12\_new\_asafe.
\* If the NSS\_SDB\_USE\_CACHE environment variable is set,
skip the runtime test sdb\_measureAccess.
\* The built-in roots module has been updated to version
1.97, which adds, removes, and distrusts several
certificates.
\* The atob utility has been improved to automatically
ignore lines of text that aren't in base64 format.
\* The certutil utility has been improved to support
creation of version 1 and version 2 certificates, in
addition to the existing version 3 support.

## Details

Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij,

Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd and Christian Holler discovered multiple

memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1518](/security/CVE-2014-1518))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1523](/security/CVE-2014-1523))

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL

object as an XBL object. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1524](/security/CVE-2014-1524))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can

run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1529](/security/CVE-2014-1529))

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load

a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. If a user had

enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct

cross-site scripting or phishing attacks. ([CVE-2014-1530](/security/CVE-2014-1530))

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some

circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0449)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1518, CVE-2014-1524, CVE-2014-1529, CVE-2014-1531)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Thunderbird resolved hosts in
certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Thunderbird
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1532)

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded JPEG
images. Loading an email or a web page containing a specially crafted JPEG
image could cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled browser navigations through
history. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause the address bar
of the browser to display a web page name while loading content from an
entirely different web page, which could allow for cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary
Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, Christian Holler,
Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Nils, Tyson Smith and Jesse
Schwartzentrube as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 24.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 24.5.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
