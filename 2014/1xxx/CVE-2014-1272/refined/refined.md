**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of symbolic links
- The vulnerability is in the `CrashHouseKeeping` component

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local user may be able to change permissions on arbitrary files, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access
- The attacker would need to have some level of access to the system to initiate the permission change process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system
- Ability to trigger the functionality in `CrashHouseKeeping` that changes permissions on files
