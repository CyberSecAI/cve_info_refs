  "CVE-2014-1737": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's floppy driver handled user space provided data in certain error code paths while processing FDRAWCMD IOCTL commands. A local user with write access to /dev/fdX could use this flaw to free (using the kfree() function) arbitrary kernel memory.",
    "root_cause": "The floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions while processing the FDRAWCMD IOCTL command. Specifically, it failed to sanitize user-provided data, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of user-provided data.",
        "Use-after-free vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and error handling."
     ],
    "impact": "A local user with write access to a floppy device (/dev/fdX) could exploit this vulnerability to free arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access, requiring write permissions to a floppy device file (/dev/fdX).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with write permissions to a floppy device."
