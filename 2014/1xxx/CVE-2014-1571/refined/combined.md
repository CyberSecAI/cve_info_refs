## Updated bugzilla packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 09 Oct 2014

Modification date: 09 Oct 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-1571](CVE-2014-1571.html)
,
[CVE-2014-1572](CVE-2014-1572.html)
,
[CVE-2014-1573](CVE-2014-1573.html)

## Description

```
Updated bugzilla packages fix security vulnerabilities:

If a new comment was marked private to the insider group, and a flag was set
in the same transaction, the comment would be visible to flag recipients
even if they were not in the insider group (CVE-2014-1571).

An attacker creating a new Bugzilla account can override certain parameters
when finalizing the account creation that can lead to the user being created
with a different email address than originally requested. The overridden
login name could be automatically added to groups based on the group's
regular expression setting (CVE-2014-1572).

During an audit of the Bugzilla code base, several places were found where
cross-site scripting exploits could occur which could allow an attacker to
access sensitive information (CVE-2014-1573).

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

in Bugzilla:

* The 'realname' parameter is not correctly filtered on user account
  creation, which could lead to user data override.

* Several places were found in the Bugzilla code where cross-site
  scripting attacks could be used to access sensitive information.

* Private comments can be shown to flagmail recipients who aren't in
  the insider group

* Specially formatted values in a CSV search results export could be
  used in spreadsheet software to attack a user's computer.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Account Creation
Affected:    2.23.3 to 4.0.14, 4.1.1 to 4.2.10, 4.3.1 to 4.4.5, 4.5.1 to 4.5.5
Fixed In:    4.0.15, 4.2.11, 4.4.6, 4.5.6
Description: An attacker creating a new Bugzilla account can override certain
             parameters when finalizing the account creation that can lead to the
             user being created with a different email address than originally
             requested. The overridden login name could be automatically added
             to groups based on the group's regular expression setting.

CVE Number:  CVE-2014-1572

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.14, 4.1.1 to 4.2.10, 4.3.1 to 4.4.5, 4.5.1 to 4.5.5
Fixed In:    4.0.15, 4.2.11, 4.4.6, 4.5.6
Description: During an audit of the Bugzilla code base, several places
             were found where cross-site scripting exploits could occur which
             could allow an attacker to access sensitive information.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075578
CVE Number:  CVE-2014-1573

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.14, 4.1.1 to 4.2.10, 4.3.1 to 4.4.5, 4.5.1 to 4.5.5
Fixed In:    4.0.15, 4.2.11, 4.4.6, 4.5.6
Description: If a new comment was marked private to the insider group, and a flag
             was set in the same transaction, the comment would be visible to
             flag recipients even if they were not in the insider group.

CVE Number:  CVE-2014-1571

Class:       Social Engineering
Affected:    2.17.1 to 4.0.14, 4.1.1 to 4.2.10, 4.3.1 to 4.4.5, 4.5.1 to 4.5.5
Fixed In:    4.0.15, 4.2.11, 4.4.6, 4.5.6
Description: Search results can be exported as a CSV file which can then be
             imported into external spreadsheet programs. Specially formatted
             field values can be interpreted as formulas which can be executed
             and used to attack a user's computer.

Setting the security flag on this because of the follow situation:
User A is in the insider group. User B can see the bug, but is not in the insider group.
UserA make a private comment and sets the needinfo? flag, with User B as the requestee. User B receives the flag mail but it includes the private comment despite them not been able to see the private comment otherwise. The bug mail is correct (shows all changes but not the private comment)Group: bugzilla-securityTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 4.0

Attached patch

[v1 patch](attachment.cgi?id=8485611&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8485611&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1064140&attachment=8485611)

There were two issues that needed to worked around:
$bug->update added the flags before the comments. I solved this by moving the flag change to further down the sub routine.
The second issues was the $bug->{comments} was cached from before the change. This was solved by adding a nocache option.
Ideally, we should move flag mail generation out of Bugzilla::Flag and into send\_changes, but that is for a different bug. Once this review is approved, I'll supply patches for 4.0, 4.2 and 4.4 if needed.

to avoid re-fetching the comments, it should be easier to delete $bug->{comments} when a comment is added.

I've attached patches for Bugzilla 4.0, 4.2 and 4.4.
There's no functional changes, code has moved around and the trunk patch didn't apply cleanly to older branches.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
