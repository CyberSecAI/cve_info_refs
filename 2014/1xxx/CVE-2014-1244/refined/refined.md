- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the handling of H.264 encoded movie files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Playing a maliciously crafted movie file may lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens/plays a specially crafted movie file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious movie file and convince a user to open it.
