**Vulnerable App:**

```
*Title:*

Allied Telesis AT-RG634A ADSL Broadband router hidden administrative
unauthenticated webshell.

*Vulnerability Information:*
- CVE: CVE-2014-1982
- Type of Vulnerability:
  - CWE-78  : OS Command Injection
  - CWE-306 : Missing Authentication for Critical Function

*Affected products:*

- Allied Telesis AT-RG634A ADSL Broadband router. (version 3.3+ and
probably others)

Other products like,
   - Allied Telesis iMG624A  (firmware version, 3.5)
   - Allied Telesis iMG616LH (firmware version, +2.4)
   - Allied Telesis iMG646BD (firmware version, 3.5)

*Vendor:*
- Allied Telesis : http://www.alliedtelesis.com//

has the same vulnerbility, but the vendor reports that the version
3.8.05 of the firmware has already addressed this issue, but we where
unable to test nor confirm this information.

*Security Patches / Workaround:*

- Allied Telesis has noted that the AT-RG634A product is no longer
supported, but gives a workaround
to mitigate the issue.

Configure the device so that only trusted devices can
access the target device using the following command,

"WEBSERVER SET MANAGEMENTIP <ip-address>"

*Short Description:*

The Allied Telesis AT-RG634A ADSL Broadband router has a hidden url
page in their admnistrative HTTP interface capable of executing
commands as admin without requiring any kind of authentication.

*Description:*

"The AT-RG634 is a full-featured, broadband media gateway and router
designed for cost-effective delivery of advanced IP Triple Play voice,
video and data services over an ADSL infrastructure. The RG634
supports Layer 3 functions, including NAT, DMZ, and Stateful
inspection firewall for delivery of revenue-generating services such
as home networking and security services." (from
www.alliedtelesis.com/p-2345.html)

The Allied Telesis AT-RG634A ADSL Broadband router has a hidden URL
(/cli.html) page to execute CLI command with admin priviledges,
available by default and without any kind of authentication.

Having as impact a total compromise of the target device.

*Steps to reproduce:*

- Connect via HTTP to the hidden page http://<device IP>/cli.html a
input box is shown, every command typed there will be executed as admin.

Entering the following lines in the hidden page (/cli.html) a new
telnet admin user called "eviluser" is added to the system.

>> system add login eviluser system set user eviluser access
>> superuser.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
