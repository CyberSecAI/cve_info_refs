| Summary | 0016879: CVE-2014-1608: soap:Envelope SQL injection attack | | | | |
| Description | The SOAP API can be used for SQL injection attacks.  Pasting relevant extracts of the original e-mail report below   ---   The xml sent to the soap webservice is sometimes validated, sometimes not. This is independend from the php.ini and seems to be dependent on the php binary. The php binaries on the different systems (I used the thoughtpolice images) differ in the libxml2 version. But I am not quite sure this is the reason.  It is definitely still an issue, but it's not 100% sure whether the responsibility is 100% at mantisbt.org  the XML request cannot be issued without a user account. The request allows to read the contents of the entire mantis database no matter what the user's access permissions are. Mantis often is used with many projects and has a fine-grain permission structure. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | If you would like to reproduce the issue, you could issue the following request to a current mantis system (1.2.15) mybe on a recent CentOS image from thoughtpolice (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/thoughtpolicevm/>). This example uses the administrator account, because it is enabled by default...  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>" xmlns:xsd="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema>" xmlns:soap="<http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/>"><soap:Body><mc\_issue\_attachment\_get xmlns="<http://futureware.biz/mantisconnect>"><username>administrator</username><password>root</password><issue\_attachment\_id>' UNION SELECT 927,3358,1337,313373,1,1,1,1,1,username,23,42 FROM mantis\_user\_table WHERE mantis\_user\_table.id=1 ORDER BY bug\_id,'true</issue\_attachment\_id></mc\_issue\_attachment\_get></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>  This request selects the username from mantis\_user\_table with id=1. The output is base64-encoded. | | | | |
| Additional Information | This issue was initially discovered and reported by e-mail by Andrea Barisani from oCERT, on behalf of Martin Herfurt martin.herfurt@nruns.com, a security researcher at n.runs professionals GmbH (<https://www.nruns.com>), who discovered the issue during an audit at a customer's site on an up-to-date machine with the latest Mantis version (1.2.15). | | | | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Fix [CVE-2014-1608](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2qwf-fhm6-c4w3 "CVE-2014-1608"): mc\_issue\_attachment\_get SQL injection

```
Use of db_query() instead of db_query_bound() allowed SQL injection
attacks due to unsanitized use of parameters within the query when using
the SOAP API mc_issue_attachment_get.

This issue was reported by e-mail by Andrea Barisani from oCERT, on
behalf of Martin Herfurt <martin.herfurt@nruns.com>, a security
researcher at n.runs professionals GmbH, who discovered the issue
during an audit at a customer's site.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix [CVE-2014-1608](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2qwf-fhm6-c4w3 "CVE-2014-1608"): mc\_issue\_attachment\_get SQL injection

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/3be86ce37bb469b211663da03f61ac2b28500d91)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
Use of db_query() instead of db_query_bound() allowed SQL injection
attacks due to unsanitized use of parameters within the query when using
the SOAP API mc_issue_attachment_get.

This issue was reported by e-mail by Andrea Barisani from oCERT, on
behalf of Martin Herfurt <martin.herfurt@nruns.com>, a security
researcher at n.runs professionals GmbH, who discovered the issue
during an audit at a customer's site.

Fixes #16879

**oCERT-2014-001 MantisBT input sanitization errors**

**Description**:

The [MantisBT](http://www.mantisbt.org) web-based bugtracking
system suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities caused by insufficient input
sanitization.

The MantisBT SOAP API uses the unsafe db\_query() function allowing a
specially crafted tag within the envelope of a mc\_issue\_attachment\_get SOAP
request to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

The reporting of this specific issue was followed by an investigation
that lead to additional cases of unsafe db\_query() function use, being found by
MantisBT maintainers, throughout MantisBT code.

**Affected version**:

[MantisBT](http://www.mantisbt.org) >= 1.1.0a4, <= 1.2.15

**Fixed version**:

[MantisBT](http://www.mantisbt.org) >= 1.2.16

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Martin Herfurt <martin.herfurt AT nruns.com>.

**CVE**: [CVE-2014-1608](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1608) (SOAP), [CVE-2014-1609](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1609) (additional SQL injections)
