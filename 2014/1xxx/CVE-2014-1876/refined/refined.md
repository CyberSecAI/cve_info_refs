CVE-2014-1876:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The unpack200 utility in OpenJDK creates log files in an insecure manner. If a user specified log file cannot be opened, the utility falls back to creating a file named /tmp/unpack.log or a file in /tmp using `tmpnam()`, which can be predictable.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure temporary file creation.
- Predictable file names.
- Missing checks for file creation permissions.

Impact of exploitation:
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability via symlink attacks. 
- Arbitrary files could be overwritten.

Attack vectors:
- Local access.
- The attacker needs to control the command line arguments passed to unpack200.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs the ability to run the unpack200 utility.
- The user running unpack200 must have write permissions.

CVE-2014-2398:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The fix for CVE-2013-5797 did not properly resolve input sanitization flaws in javadoc, the Java API Documentation Generator. When javadoc documentation was generated from untrusted Java source code, it failed to escape HTML special characters < and >, allowing XSS attacks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insufficient input sanitization in javadoc.
- Lack of proper escaping of HTML special characters.

Impact of exploitation:
- A remote attacker can perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the domain hosting generated API documentation.

Attack vectors:
- Remote access through web browsers when visiting a website with maliciously crafted javadoc documentation.
- Maliciously crafted Java source code used to generate vulnerable javadoc documentation.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to control the generated javadoc output.
- A user must visit a malicious website serving the crafted javadoc documentation.

Additional Details:
- The fix for CVE-2013-5797 added escaping of quotes and non-ASCII characters, but failed to escape HTML special characters < and >.
- Both vulnerabilities require a user to run the unpack200 tool or use the generated javadoc output.
- Multiple fallbacks are tried when creating log files: specified file, /tmp/unpack.log, tmpnam generated file, /dev/null, and stderr.
