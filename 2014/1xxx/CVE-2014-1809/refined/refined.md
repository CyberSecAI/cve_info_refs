- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MSCOMCTL common controls library used by Microsoft Office software does not properly implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper implementation of ASLR in the MSCOMCTL common controls library.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature. This bypass, by itself, does not permit arbitrary code execution. However, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (like a remote code execution vulnerability) to run arbitrary code by making memory addresses predictable.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Web-based attack: An attacker hosts a website with malicious content that exploits the vulnerability when a user visits it using a browser capable of instantiating COM components like Internet Explorer.
    - Embedding malicious content: An attacker could embed a specially crafted ActiveX control (marked "safe for initialization") within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.
    - Compromised/user-content websites: Compromised sites or sites hosting user-provided content could include exploit code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to host or control a website with malicious content or embed a malicious control in a document or application.
    - The victim needs to visit the attacker-controlled website with a vulnerable browser or open a malicious document.
    - The attacker needs to combine this vulnerability with another vulnerability (e.g., RCE) to achieve arbitrary code execution.
