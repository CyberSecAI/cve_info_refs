******************************************************************************

DESCRIPTIONS
===========

1) CVE-2014-1441:
     Race condition leading to Denial of Service on the "AUTH SSL" command with invalid SSL data:

           We have observed that when using the AUTH SSL command, followed by invalid data, the CORE FTP application
crashes.
           This would allow a remote malicious individual to generate a denial of service condition and disrupt
services.

           + Proof of Concept:
                - Use the "AUTH SSL" command.
                - Hit the "enter" key twice.
                - Observe that the application crashes.

2) CVE-2014-1442:
      "XCRC" Directory Traversal Information Disclosure:

           We have observed that the CORE FTP software is vulnerable to Directory Traversal by leveraging the "XCRC"
command.
           This allows a remote malicious individual to determine the existence of a file outside the current FTP root
directory.

           + Proof of Concept:
                - Log in to the Core FTP Server.
                - Use the "XCRC" command with a filename that does not exist on the user designated root directory.
                - Observe the "550 File not found.." response.
                - Use the "XCRC" command with a filename belonging to a file residing directly outside the user
designated root folder (one level higher than the root directory).
                - Observe the "550 File not found.." response.
                - Use the "XCRC" command with the same filename as before, but add "/../" in front of the file name.
                - Observe the 250 response.

3) CVE-2014-1443:
      Password Disclosure Vulnerability:

           We have observed that using a specifically crafted string it is possible to obtain the password belonging to
the user that last logged in to the Core FTP Server.
           This appears to be related to a buffer size issue. The crafted string requires 211 characters in order to
work.

           + Proof of Concept:
                - Log into the Core FTP Server with a valid user.
                - Close the terminal.
                - Use the "USER" command with the following string:
"%xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
                - Observe that the previously used password is disclosed

Security vulnerability announcement

-----------------------------------------------

3 security issues have been uncovered that pose potential security threats to Core FTP Server. The three security issues include a:

Password vulnerabilty

SSL vulnerability

XCRC vulernability

It is in your best interest to immediately upgrade your Core FTP Server software to avoid any potential breach of security with your FTP Server. If Core FTP Server is only being used for SSH/SFTP only, these security issues will not apply to your setup, and no upgrade will be necessary.

Selected builds have had security fixes applied and provided for licenses that are not valid for current builds. You will need to install an updated build to be protected from these vulnerabilities. Updated builds can be installed directly over your existing builds. Users upgrading to the 369 build, read the readme.txt for important domain changes.

Build 515 and greater include security fixes for licenses that are currently up to date.

Build 481 Licenses that have upgrade periods ending May 10th, 2013 - May 1st, 2014

Build 439 Licenses that have upgrade periods ending May 10th, 2012 - May 9th, 2013

Build 369 Applies to licenses with upgrades though May 9th, 2012

(All other licensed users may upgrade to this build).

Updated builds can be found here:

coreftp.com/server/download/archive/

All licensed users were notified immediately of the security update via email prior to this announcement. If you are not a licensed user, sign up here to be notified of future updates:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
