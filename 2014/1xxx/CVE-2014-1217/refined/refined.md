- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthenticated access to a specific URL (`/home/systemsetting.aspx`) allowed access to sensitive configuration change functionality and revealed the database connection string, including authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of authentication/authorization controls on the `systemsetting.aspx` page. This led to exposure of sensitive information and allowed unauthorized modification of the system configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to the database credentials and system configurations, potentially leading to complete control of the application and its data. This includes the ability to modify configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the vulnerable URL (`/home/systemsetting.aspx`) directly through a web browser or via a script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the Timelive server hosting the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerable URL was easily discoverable through a simple Google search.
