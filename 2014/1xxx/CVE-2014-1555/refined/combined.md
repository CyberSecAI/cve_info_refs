## Description

The ConvolveHorizontally function in Skia, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 31.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.7, and Thunderbird before 24.7, does not properly handle the discarding of image data during function execution, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by triggering prolonged image scaling, as demonstrated by scaling of a high-quality image.

Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1544 CVE-2014-1547 CVE-2014-1555 CVE-2014-1556
                 CVE-2014-1557

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety
errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.7.0-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-61

## Use-after-free with FireOnStateChange event

Announced
July 22, 2014
Reporter
Jethro Beekman
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 31
* Firefox ESR 24.7
* Thunderbird 24.7
* Thunderbird 31

### Description

Security researcher Jethro Beekman of the University of
California, Berkeley reported a crash when the `FireOnStateChange`
event is triggered in some circumstances. This leads to a use-after-free and a
potentially exploitable crash when it occurs.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Update our progress in docloader before calling state change listeners
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Probably not very easily, especially in a stock Firefox.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? Somewhat, yes. I could remove the comment, but then this is likely to get re-broken again in the future...
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All of them, I think.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? I think this should be easy to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? I \_think\_ this should be pretty safe, but you can never be sure with this code.

Update our progress in docloader before calling state change listeners
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Been around forever.
User impact if declined: Possibly-exploitable crashes.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.):
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Medium risk, I think. A
possibly less risky alternative would be to reget the hashtable entry instead
of reordering the write, but I worry a (small) bit about performance impact.
And even the regetting would need to be done pretty carefully, so might not be
any less risky.
String or IDL/UUID changes made by this patch: None.

At first I was unable to discern a pattern, so I suspected memory corruption 'somewhere'. I finally found a website that on load would semi-reliably (>50% of the time) crash the browser. Using valgrind, I was able to find the source:
==27741== Invalid read of size 8
==27741== at 0x84DA95A: nsDocLoader::OnProgress(nsIRequest\*, nsISupports\*, unsigned long, unsigned long) (nsDocLoader.cpp:1084)
...
==27741== Address 0x3dda9110 is 1,168 bytes inside a block of size 6,144 free'd
==27741== at 0x4C2B60C: free (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload\_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==27741== by 0x8127265: ChangeTable(PLDHashTable\*, int) (pldhash.cpp:483)
==27741== by 0x81276A1: PL\_DHashTableOperate (pldhash.cpp:580)
==27741== by 0x84DAFC1: nsDocLoader::OnStopRequest(nsIRequest\*, nsISupports\*, tag\_nsresult) (nsDocLoader.cpp:632)
What happens is:
1. On line nsDocLoader.cpp:1033, the nsRequestInfo\* info is retrieved.
2. On line 1080 FireOnStateChange might be called. This can result in all kinds of things happening in the mean time, I've seen call stacks with FireOnStateChange 80 call frames deep. Some other request that was handled might cause the mRequestInfoHash table to be re-hashed, freeing the nsRequestInfo that info was pointing to. OCSP requests in particular seem to be affected, perhaps because it adds to the call stack in ways other requests don't.
3. On line 1084, info gets used anyway (use-after-free). The freed memory might have been reallocated in the mean-time, resulting in 8 "random" bytes being overwritten. This is sometimes harmless, sometimes it causes a SEGFAULT. I have seen cases of up to 10 different use-after-frees happening before the crash.
The attached patch will highlight the problem, and seemingly fix it if you uncomment the commented line. I suggest an actual fix be written by someone who knows the codebase.
Filing as a security bug because local process memory can be overwritten with network-controlled data (e.g. number of bytes received). A skillful attacker might be able to craft a website that does the just right set of requests, responding with the just right responses to trigger this bug (perhaps multiple times) and overwrite memory with its chosen data.
The following breakpad reports are all the reports from my installation since the upgrade to Firefox 29, and might be related. It's hard to tell if any of these are caused by this, because the nature of the bug is such that a crash will happen much later than the memory corruption, so there might be no trace of the causing function. Also, I looked through Mercurial and could not figure out what changed that caused this to suddenly started happening in Firefox 29.Whiteboard: [qa-][adv-main31+][adv-esr24.7+] → [qa-][adv-main31+][adv-esr24.7+] original description in comment 26

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                 CVE-2014-1557

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser:  Multiple memory safety errors and
use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.7.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
