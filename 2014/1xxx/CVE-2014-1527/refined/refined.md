  "cve": "CVE-2014-1527",
  "description": "On Firefox for Android, when the addressbar has been scrolled off screen, an attacker can prevent it from rendering again through the use of script interacting DOM events. This allows an attacker to present a fake addressbar to the user, possibly leading to successful phishing attacks.",
  "information": [
    {
      "type": "vulnerability_details",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to prevent the address bar from reappearing after it's been hidden by scrolling, using `preventDefault()` on touchstart and DOMMouseScroll events.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of touch and scroll events",
          "Ability to suppress the address bar rendering"
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious website could use this vulnerability to spoof the browser's UI, specifically the address bar, potentially leading to phishing attacks by displaying a fake address bar. This is particularly dangerous on devices without hardware buttons that can reliably reveal the real address bar.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious website leveraging JavaScript"
         ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a webpage with malicious JavaScript. The user needs to visit this page with a vulnerable version of Firefox for Android.",
         "affected_product": "Firefox for Android"
