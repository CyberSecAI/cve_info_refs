This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser:  Multiple memory safety errors and
use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.7.0esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Found by the BlackBerry Security Automated Analysis Team's fuzzing framework ALF.
At this time we are unable to create a test case that will reproduce the issue. However we do see it during our analysis a couple times a day so once a build with a fix is available we should be able to verify that this issue has been resolved.

PL\_FinishArenaPool should not be called when any thread that uses NSS
is still running. This is the cause of the heap-use-after-free and
use-after-poison.
The easiest fix would be to not call PL\_FinishArenaPool, just like
we do not call PR\_Cleanup.

Al:
My [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=963150#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in libnss3.so!CERT_DestroyCertificate") was wrong. I confused PL\_FinishArenaPool with PL\_ArenaFinish.
It is perfectly fine to call PL\_FinishArenaPool. Please disregard [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=963150#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in libnss3.so!CERT_DestroyCertificate")
in its entirety.
ssl3con.c:9635 is:
9628 static void
9629 ssl3\_CleanupPeerCerts(sslSocket \*ss)
9630 {
9631 PLArenaPool \* arena = ss->ssl3.peerCertArena;
9632 ssl3CertNode \*certs = (ssl3CertNode \*)ss->ssl3.peerCertChain;
9633
9634 for (; certs; certs = certs->next) {
9635 CERT\_DestroyCertificate(certs->cert);
9636 }
9637 if (arena) PORT\_FreeArena(arena, PR\_FALSE);
9638 ss->ssl3.peerCertArena = NULL;
9639 ss->ssl3.peerCertChain = NULL;
9640 }
9641
The call stack says it's the ssl3\_DestroySSL3Info, so I guess compiler inlined
the ssl3\_CleanupPeerCerts call. I inspected the relevant code in NSS but didn't
see anything wrong.Flags: needinfo?(wtc)

Tyson:
Thanks a lot for the four new crash reports. They show the problem is
independent of the caller of CERT\_DestroyCertificate. I suspect some
code is calling CERT\_DestroyCertificate when it should not.
Could you please set the environment variable NSS\_DISABLE\_ARENA\_FREE\_LIST
to 1, and run Firefox under AddressSanitizer again? Please build Firefox
with the in-tree NSS. If you configured Firefox with the --with-system-nss
configure option, please remove that configure option.
This will show us the real culprit who makes the incorrect call to
CERT\_DestroyCertificate. Thanks.

Tyson: Thank you for the new heap-buffer-overflow report. I
assume you are only getting this error after setting the
environment variable NSS\_DISABLE\_ARENA\_FREE\_LIST to 1?
If so, we will need to fix this heap-buffer-overflow error
first before we can track down the original heap-use-after-free
error.

The heap-buffer-overflow report was found before I set NSS\_DISABLE\_ARENA\_FREE\_LIST to 1. I have since done so and I will post a back trace as soon as I get one.
Should I log a separate bug for the heap-buffer-overflow?

Yes, please log a separate bug for the heap-buffer-overflow.
The back trace is strange because it says NSS freed a huge
3026032-byte region. I inspected the relevant code yesterday
but didn't see anything wrong.
I ran the NSS test suite several times under AddressSanitizer
today but could not reproduce either the heap-use-after-free
or the heap-buffer-overflow. So I will wait for your new back
trace. Thanks.

Thanks a lot for the new stack traces. They are a different problem.
Were these crashes? They don't look like AddressSanitizer error reports.

Wan-Teh:
Yeah you're right, gdb says: "Program received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe."
The reason I added this is because I believe that both of these issues are triggered by the timing of the server that is serving my test cases. This may be a long shot but is it possible that the SIGPIPE leads to the original issue?
I tried recreating the conditions that I believe are triggering the issue but I haven't had any luck, so I will continue to monitor our main test system for new logs.

Tyson:
Receiving SIGPIPE is normal and is not an error. All networking apps need to
install a signal handler for SIGPIPE to ignore it.
When running Firefox in gdb, you need to tell gdb to ignore SIGPIPE. (I forgot
what the gdb command is.)

wtc's is away right now, I'd like him to review my analysis here when he gets back.
As a first cut at what is going on here, it looks like we have a race between 2 NSSCertificate structures being added to the trust domain. I think the normal case is the 2 certs point to identical cert pointers and the failing case is when they aren't identical. The free in the trust domain frees the NSS certificate out from under the CERTCertificate passed into PK11\_ImportCertificates(). Since the caller of PK11\_ImportCertificates doesn't expect his cert to go away, this will cause some problems. PK11\_ImportCertificates will get the new cert (with a new reference) from the nssTrustDomain\_AddCertsToCache(), while the old cert is freed out from underneath (also freeing the CERTCertificate associated with it).
If we add the following code to PK11\_ImportCert(), we would preserve the old NSSCertificate and free our dangling reference to the new one.
diff --git a/lib/pk11wrap/pk11cert.c b/lib/pk11wrap/pk11cert.c
--- a/lib/pk11wrap/pk11cert.c

SECITEM\_FreeItem(keyID,PR\_TRUE);
if (PORT\_GetError() != SEC\_ERROR\_TOKEN\_NOT\_LOGGED\_IN) {
PORT\_SetError(SEC\_ERROR\_ADDING\_CERT);
}
We still have the problem of how we wound up with two separate CERTCertificate/NSSCertificate structures pointing to the same certificate, but at least this would clear up the memory issue.

If |c| is swapped by nssTrustDomain\_AddCertsToCache, the
STAN\_ForceCERTCertificateUpdate will be updating the new
value of |c|. Do you think it should update the original
value of |c| instead?

No, I don't think so. The original 'c' is a doa pointer that will disappear once the caller frees it.

If it is a sec-critical and affects ESR24, we'd need to backport it (or update NSS, in other words).

Bob: I am confused. The original 'c' is still available in cert->nssCertificate.
Since we add a reference to the original 'c', cert->nssCertificate is unchanged
and still valid after the nssTrustDomain\_AddCertsToCache call. So we could pass
cert->nssCertificate instead of 'c' to STAN\_ForceCERTCertificateUpdate.

Al - This bug is several months old. Can you comment on the need to backport this to ESR, which will live for 3 more cycles (>16 more weeks).
I would also appreciate a short explanation of the risk associated with updating NSS on ESR and beta. Has NSS had any potentially breaking changes?

It is a critical bug on a branch we're still supporting for three more cycles. That is the "need" in question. This is not a low rated issue.
The age of the bug is immaterial.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1544 CVE-2014-1547 CVE-2014-1555 CVE-2014-1556
                 CVE-2014-1557

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety
errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code
or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 24.7.0-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-63

## Use-after-free while when manipulating certificates in the trusted cache

Announced
July 22, 2014
Reporter
Tyson Smith, Jesse Schwartzentruber
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 31
* Firefox ESR 24.7
* Thunderbird 24.7
* Thunderbird 31

### Description

Security researchers **Tyson Smith** and **Jesse
Schwartzentruber** used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to
discover a use-after-free error resulting in a crash. This is a result of a pair
of `NSSCertificate` structures being added to a trust domain and then
one of them is removed while they are still in use by the trusted cache. This
crash is potentially exploitable.

This issue was addressed in the [Network Security Services (NSS) library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Overview_of_NSS) in version 3.16.2,
shipping on affected platforms.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad](//linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad)
