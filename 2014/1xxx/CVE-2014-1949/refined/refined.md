Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the 'Menu' key within the GTK+ library, specifically related to the implementation of popup menus in `GtkWindow`. Pressing the menu key repeatedly can cause multiple menus to open.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Screen Lock Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the screen lock in Cinnamon sessions. By exploiting the menu key behavior, an attacker can gain focus below the screensaver, enabling them to execute commands.
*   **Focus Manipulation:** The 'Menu' key opens a context menu, and pressing 'Escape' after opening the menu, allows the attacker to gain focus outside of the screensaver.
*   **Unintended Menu Creation:** Repeatedly pressing the menu key can spawn an excessive number of fallback popup menus, which is not the intended behaviour.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with physical access to a locked machine can bypass the screen lock and gain access to the locked session.
*   **Desktop Control:** Once the lock screen is bypassed, the attacker can execute commands, potentially gaining full control of the user's desktop session.
*   **Potential Data Breach:** Access to the session could lead to unauthorized access to personal data, files, and applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the machine.
*   **Keyboard Interaction:** The attacker needs to use the 'Menu' key on the keyboard and the 'Escape' key to bypass the screen lock.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker uses Alt+F2 to open a command dialog and then executes commands to kill the screensaver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the vulnerable machine.
*   **Basic Keyboard Skills:** The attacker needs to know how to use specific keys, like the 'Menu', 'Escape', and Alt+F2.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered using the 'Menu' key on the keyboard (often found to the right of the space bar) and not the DE's 'menu' key.
*   The issue was initially reported in relation to the Cinnamon desktop environment on Fedora 20.
*   The root cause was in GTK+, not the Cinnamon screensaver itself.
*   Patches were made to GTK+ to resolve the root cause of the issue.
*   A temporary patch was also made to Cinnamon screensaver to prevent the GtkWindow popup\_menu from ever getting called.
*   The issue is also known to affect other distributions such as Ubuntu and Mageia.
