# USN-2475-1: GTK+ update

15 January 2015

GTK+ improperly handled the menu key, possibly allowing lock screen bypass.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [gtk+3.0](/security/cves?package=gtk+3.0) - GTK+ graphical user interface library

## Details

Clemens Fries discovered that GTK+ allowed bypassing certain screen locks

by using the menu key. An attacker with physical access could possibly use

this flaw to gain access to a locked session.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libgtk-3-0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gtk%2B3.0)
  -
  [3.10.8-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gtk%2B3.0/3.10.8-0ubuntu1.4)

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make

all the necessary changes.

Ubuntu Pro provides up to ten-year security coverage for over 23,000 open-source packages within the Ubuntu Main and Universe repositories.

## Updated gtk+3.0 packages fix CVE-2014-1949

Publication date: 09 Sep 2014

Modification date: 09 Sep 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-1949](CVE-2014-1949.html)

## Description

```
Updated gtk+3.0 packages fix security vulnerability:

Clemens Fries reported that, when using Cinnamon, it was possible to bypass
the screensaver lock. An attacker with physical access to the machine could
use this flaw to take over the locked desktop session (CVE-2014-1949).

This was fixed by including a patch for the root cause of the issue in
gtk+3.0, which came from the implementation of popup menus in GtkWindow
(bgo#722106).

This update also includes other patches from upstream to fix bugs affecting
GtkFileChooser (bgo#386569, bgo#719977) and GtkSpinButton (bgo#709491), and a
crash related to clipboard handling (bgo#719314).

# cinnamon-screensaver lock bypass (tested on Fedora 20)

---

*From*: Clemens Fries <clemens () xenoworld de>

*Date*: Wed, 12 Feb 2014 10:48:28 +0100 (CET)

```
Hello,

It is possible to circumvent the screen lock on a cinnamon session under Fedora
20 using the 'Menu' key on a keyboard. I'm posting this here, because I assume
that this is not limited to the version shipped with Fedora.

Steps to reproduce:

* Start cinnamon session
* Lock the screen (Ctrl+Alt+L)
* Press the 'Menu' key on the keyboard
* A menu appears for a brief moment
* Press 'Escape'
* Focus is now beneath the screensaver
* Press Alt+F2
* Start 'gnome-terminal'
* Type 'killall cinnamon-screensaver'

Seen on a fully patched Fedora 20 (February 12th, 2014). I had a brief look at
bugzilla.redhat.com, but it seems this has not been reported. I also tested
this on a second machine with the same outcome.

Some version information:

$ rpm -qi cinnamon
Name        : cinnamon
Version     : 2.0.14
Release     : 4.fc20
Architecture: x86_64
[...]

$ rpm -qi cinnamon-screensaver
Name        : cinnamon-screensaver
Version     : 2.0.3
Release     : 1.fc20
Architecture: x86_64
[...]

Kind regards,
Clemens

```

If you move your mouse while doing it you'll see the bug more clearly (otherwise, you have to look at the "increasing" shadow of the menu) ``` |  |

Subject: Followup: CVE-2014-1949: cinnamon-screensaver can be bypassed by pressing
Menu key
Date: Sun, 24 Aug 2014 15:45:45 -0400
```
Package: libgtk-3-0
Version: 3.10.8~4
Severity: important
Tags: upstream

Just a followup to the referenced bug, at <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi->
bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=738828

This appears to be the commit that fixes the issue:
[https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=1691bb741d50c90ee938f0b73fe81b0ca9bfd6d4](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk%2B/commit/?id=1691bb741d50c90ee938f0b73fe81b0ca9bfd6d4)

Testing locally confirms.

An easier way to manifest this issue is to open a gtk3 app (Such as gnome-
terminal), activate the physical menu key (NOT your DE's 'menu' key) - the one
traditionally to the right of the space bar, and usually displaying a small
context menu picture on it.  Once the gnome-terminal context menu pops up, keep
pressing the menu key.  This will spawn endless GtkWindow 'fallback' popup
menus - more noticeable if you move the pointer while doing this.  This issue
was originally reported here:
<https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/3443>.

An effective patch for cinnamon-screensaver (to address the security issue) is
here: <https://github.com/mtwebster/cinnamon->
screensaver/commit/da7af55f1fa966c52e15cc288d4f8928eca8cc9f which will prevent
the GtkWindow popup_menu from ever getting called.

A patch is currently not yet available.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1064695#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-13 06:12:30 UTC  ```  Created cinnamon tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1064697](show_bug.cgi?id=1064697 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-1949 cinnamon: bypass screensaver lock via the keyboard's Menu key [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1064695#c2)  Martin Prpič    2014-08-25 15:20:27 UTC  ``` Note that a similar issue was reported [1], which causes cinnamon to freeze when holding the 'menu' key.
