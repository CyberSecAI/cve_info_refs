Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1589:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stemmed from improperly declared namespaces in some chrome-accessible CSS stylesheets. These stylesheets, intended for use with XUL (XML User Interface Language) elements, lacked a primary namespace declaration or had the incorrect namespace declared. This allowed web content to leverage these stylesheets to manipulate XBL (XML Binding Language) bindings, leading to security bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Namespace Declarations:** The core issue was the missing or incorrect primary namespace declaration in specific chrome-accessible CSS stylesheets.
- **XBL Binding Manipulation:** The lack of proper namespace declarations allowed web content to trigger and manipulate chrome-level XBL bindings.
- **Security Restriction Bypass:**  By manipulating XBL bindings, attackers could bypass intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Security Restrictions:** Attackers could circumvent security mechanisms in the browser, gaining unauthorized access or control.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided test case, the vulnerability could have enabled the execution of arbitrary code by manipulating specific XBL bindings.
    - The provided test case, however, only shows the manipulation of the `WindowProperties` object to trigger the `print` function of the main browser window, demonstrating a potentially broader attack surface.
- **Other unspecified impact:** The advisory mentions "other unspecified impact", implying further potential for exploitation beyond the demonstrated test case.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** The primary attack vector involved enticing a user to view a specially crafted web page that included vulnerable CSS stylesheets.
- **Manipulation of CSS:** Attackers could exploit improperly declared namespaces in vulnerable CSS stylesheets to trigger XBL bindings.
- **Indirect XBL manipulation:** The attacker does not directly manipulate XBL, but rather uses CSS to do so.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker could be remote, needing only the ability to deliver a malicious web page to a victim.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to visit a malicious page, and possibly interact with it further, e.g. pressing a print button in the provided test case.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable CSS:** The attacker needs to know which specific CSS stylesheets had improperly declared namespaces.
- **Manipulation Techniques:** The attacker needs to craft CSS and HTML content in such a way that the vulnerable stylesheets and associated bindings will trigger.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was primarily in Firefox and SeaMonkey, and was fixed in Firefox 34 and SeaMonkey 2.31.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity.
- The bug report mentions that the most serious potential consequences of the vulnerability were partially mitigated by other changes in the codebase.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2014-1589 vulnerability allowed remote attackers to bypass browser security restrictions through manipulation of XBL bindings via CSS stylesheets with improper namespace declarations. Although the provided test case triggered the print function via the window object, the primary concern of this vulnerability was the capability to execute arbitrary code, or cause other unspecified impact.
