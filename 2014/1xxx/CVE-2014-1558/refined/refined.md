Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1558:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content includes a security advisory and bug reports related to CVE-2014-1558, indicating that it involves incorrect handling of non-UTF-8 characters in SSL certificates.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of character encodings in SSL certificates by Mozilla products, specifically when processing the certificate's common name. The code assumed that the common name would always be encoded in UTF-8, which is not a standard, leading to crashes when invalid characters were encountered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect encoding assumptions**: The code assumed that strings in certificates are UTF-8, while they could be in other encodings (like Windows character sets).
- **Lack of input validation**: The code did not validate that the input string was actually valid UTF-8 before attempting to convert or use it.
- **Assertion failure**: When a non-UTF-8 string was encountered, the code triggered an assertion, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A specially crafted certificate with non-UTF-8 characters in the common name can cause a crash in Firefox and Thunderbird.
- **Denial of Service:** Repeated crashes caused by malicious certificates could lead to a denial of service.
- **Inability to use valid certificates:** Due to improper parsing, valid SSL certificates might be incorrectly processed, potentially leading to connection failures and rendering websites inaccessible.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker could potentially use a maliciously crafted certificate to cause a denial of service.
- **Compromised certificates:** Malicious certificates may be issued through compromised certificate authorities and could cause crashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious certificate to the user's browser or email client. This may be achieved by MITM attacks or using compromised certificates.
- No special user interaction is needed other than opening a page with the malicious cert or opening an email with such a cert.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**
- The vulnerability was introduced due to changes in how strings were handled from Bug 997795.
- The fix involves checking if a string is valid UTF-8 before using it and skipping invalid strings in the common name or SubjectAltName field if it's not valid UTF-8.
- The fix was implemented in multiple versions of Firefox and Thunderbird (31 and above).
- The vulnerability was categorized as "sec-moderate."
- The fix included checking strings for valid UTF-8 and preventing assertion failures and crashes when invalid encoding is encountered.

In summary, the vulnerability was caused by improper assumptions about character encoding in SSL certificates, leading to crashes and preventing the use of valid certificates. The fix involved properly validating character encodings before attempting to process the string and preventing crashes.
