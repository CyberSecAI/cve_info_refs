Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

I assume this is a broken UTF8String:
240:d=2 hl=3 l= 128 cons: SEQUENCE
243:d=3 hl=2 l= 56 cons: SET
245:d=4 hl=2 l= 54 cons: SEQUENCE
247:d=5 hl=2 l= 3 prim: OBJECT :commonName
252:d=5 hl=2 l= 47 prim: UTF8STRING :EBG Elektronik Sertifika Hizmet Sa��layıcısı
I also get the second assertion for another certificate that has broken symbols in the OSCP URI. I assume this is the same bug, if that's not the case, please let me know and I'll file separately.

We should not expect strings in a certificate to be UTF-8. There's no standard and I would guess that it's probably the Windows character set for whatever locale the requestor and/or CA used.
Domain names we should require to be in punycode form. I'm not sure all CA's do that, but since multiple IDNA names can map to the same punycode DNS host we should stick to that one form and not try to guess which character set was intended. If we guess wrong an attacker could take advantage of the difference in interpretation between the CA and Firefox to get a fraudulent cert.

Unless you can fix this right away by doing the "simpler error" thing, please back out the patch for [bug 997795](/show_bug.cgi?id=997795 "VERIFIED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Unexpected non-ASCII character: '!(*s2 & ~0x7F)', file ../../../dist/include/nsCharTraits.h, line 167") from Gecko 31 and Gecko 32. It looks to me like the new code in that patch is potentially more dangerous than the code that replaced. [Bug 997795](/show_bug.cgi?id=997795 "VERIFIED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Unexpected non-ASCII character: '!(*s2 & ~0x7F)', file ../../../dist/include/nsCharTraits.h, line 167") is really not a big deal anyway.

I looked at the code for CERT\_GetCommonName and AFAICT it tries to convert all non-UTF-8 encodings to UTF-8. But, it also seems like if the input data \*claims\* to be UTF-8 encoded, then it just returns the input data without verifying it really is UTF-8 encoded. Thus, it seems to me that rather than checking IsASCII() we should really be doing some IsUTF8() check, right? In other words, it seems like your initial assumption that the result will never be anything but UTF-8 encoded was correct (and my assumption about this in the previous bug was wrong), but we still need to check that the UTF-8 encoding is actually a valid UTF-8 encoding. That is, instead of using a function that \*assumes\* valid UTF-8, we need to use a function that \*verifies\* valid UTF-8.
The next problem is that IsASCII(commonName) may be true even if commonName is not a syntactically-correct hostname or IP address. If we interpret this bug narrowly to be "get rid of the invalid UTF-8 assertion" then IsASCII seems like the wrong solution because it is overly strict. If we interpret this bug more broadly to be about us trying to show names that would never be matched in a call to CERT\_VerifyCertName then IsASCII is not strict enough. Either way, it seems like IsASCII isn't the best test to be using here.
It isn't clear to me from the patch why we would consider it OK to just skip a unicode-encoded hostname that appears in the certificate. Is it because RFC 5280 requires international hostnames to be punycode-encoeded? If so, let's reference the relevent section of the RFC in a comment in this code.
The next problem is that the same, or worse, sort of encoding issues also seem to affect GetSubjectAltNames, right? Why are we trying to carefully check the encoding of the common name without also carefully checking the encoding of the SubjectAltName? (Note that it isn't clear whether SubjectAltName is dealing with supposedly-UTF-8-encoded strings or not.)
The next problem is that, if I am reading CERT\_GetCommonName correctly, it will \*never\* return an embedded null character, because it escapes them. Thus, the comment doesn't make sense. (Note that it isn't clear to me whether SubjectAltName is dealing with escaped strings or not, because I didn't look into how CERT\_GeneralNames are constructed--in particular, whether they are normalized to UTF-8 or not.)
The next problem I see has to do with the way we are presenting non-ASCII names, whether they are punycode-encoded within the cert or whether they are not in punycode in the certificate. We have rules about when we show punycode to users and when we show the decoded Unicode, based on what languages the user claims to understand. Our error messages that include hostnames and/or URIs should be following those rules. If you want to consider that out of scope of this bug, that's find, but let's file a follow-up bug for fixing this along with a comment in the code referencing that bug.
Finally, note that NSS defines a function CERT\_GetValidDNSPatternsFromCert which is very much like this code and which seems to suffer from similar issues--e.g. not checking whether dNSNames or IP Addresses are syntactically valid or not, especially in the case of the common name. Whatever bugs we've found in this code should be filed against CERT\_GetValidDNSPatternsFromCert too.
The main thing I'm looking for in an updated patch is some comment justifying the logic used to decide whether to include a hostname in the output (and/or improved logic), and consistency between how the encoding issues are dealt with respect to the subject common name and subjectAltName, along with some tests. The rest of the issues I mentioned can all be deferred to follow-up bugs.

From RFC 5280 section 7.2 ( Internationalized Domain Names in GeneralName)
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) may be included in certificates
and CRLs in the subjectAltName and issuerAltName extensions, name
constraints extension, authority information access extension,
subject information access extension, CRL distribution points
extension, and issuing distribution point extension. Each of these
extensions uses the GeneralName type; one choice in GeneralName is
the dNSName field, which is defined as type IA5String.
An IA5String limites to ASCII characters, that is why IsASCII should be the
correct thing to do.

This comment isn't clear to me - by "host identifier" do you mean domain name?
Also, please be sure to reference the bug filed about fixing this here.

That is how I initially implemented but you cannot create a new identifier inside
a switch statement. So I will address all your comments but this one.

fix-not-decode-invalid (v2.1)
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? It is difficult, as it only show where we are not decoding things properly.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, we are introducing checks for data types that were not before.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All of the current branches. The bug was initially introduced on [bug 401755](/show_bug.cgi?id=401755 "RESOLVED FIXED - Cleanup nsNSSIOLayer.cpp->getErrorMessage") landing on the tree 2007-11-12.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have back-ports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet, there will be a one line difference between (32-33) and the rest of the branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely, this patch happens on the error path during name mismatch. For regression, just testing that visiting to a site with an invalid name (name mistmatch) the error message contains the names of the certificate.

I was never able to reproduce the crash, despite multiple builds and platforms. However, I can see similar asserts in affected builds. Also, I can see the URL string in the SSL error page displayed incorrectly when using those builds.
In Fx31 and Fx32, as of latest builds, the asserts are gone and I see a nicer error: "The certificate is not valid for any server names."
In Fx33, today's build, I see "sec\_error\_unknown\_critical\_extension" instead.
I don't understand the change in behavior for Fx33, but I am marking verified on all branches. Someone can feel free to chime in if they'd like to explain the different error message in Fx33.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file ../../../dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 422") but has a different cause according to [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427") in that bug. It also reproduces with the patch from that bug.
Marked s-s until investigated and confirmed to be harmless.

Well, it looks like a couple of things are wrong here:
1. nsStdURLParser::ParseURL shouldn't be happy parsing a url like '[http:\257/ocsp.verisign.com](http:///%5C257/ocsp.verisign.com)' (it ends up saying the host is '\257'
2. nsDNSService::AsyncResolve does this:
683 nsAutoCString hostACE;
684 if (idn && !IsASCII(\*hostPtr)) {
685 if (NS\_SUCCEEDED(idn->ConvertUTF8toACE(\*hostPtr, hostACE)))
686 hostPtr = &hostACE;
687 }
It probably shouldn't assume that a string is automatically UTF8 if it isn't ASCII.
Also, I discovered plenty of places in nsNSSCertHelper.cpp that make similar mistakes (i.e. assuming something is ASCII or UTF8 without actually checking).

Patrick - is there someone on the networking team that can work on this? Basically what's happening is PSM is opening a channel for an OCSP request to a url specified in a certificate which is causing problems (see [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427")). (The issues in nsNSSCertHelper.cpp can be dealt with separately.)Flags: needinfo?(mcmanus)

I'm happy to look into the issue.
It's also interesting that clicking on the link '[http:\257/ocsp.verisign.com](http:///%5C257/ocsp.verisign.com)' and copying it in another tab leads to different behaviours (first goes to \257 the second to www..com/ocsp... )

This patch fixes the assertion, which is largely due to the fact that GetAsciiHost returns non-ascii/non-utf8 characters.
Is it ok to return an error code if it's not utf8?Assignee: nobody → valentin.gosu

that seems right. We certainly don't handle any other cases now (I don't believe there are other legitimate cases, but I'm not positive). so fixing the precondition checks on the existing code is the right thing.

Check string is UTF8
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily, considering javascript strings are utf16, and the code path isn't obvious.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No. While it's expected that the string should be UTF8, the method of triggering the assertion isn't obvious.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
In all supported branches. Blame lists [Bug 542222](/show_bug.cgi?id=542222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Reduce recursion in makefiles") but the code is a lot older than that.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
[Attachment 8449208](/attachment.cgi?id=8449208 "utf8.patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8449208&action=edit "utf8.patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8449208&action=diff "utf8.patch") can be applied to beta and aurora, and 8449516 is rebased on m-c.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely to cause regressions, as there is no relevant change in functionality.

Marking esr24 as wontfix since sec-moderates in general aren't taken there. Feel free to set it back to affected and request approval if you want to argue the case that it should be. Also, please request Aurora/Beta/b2g30/b2g28 approval on this patch when you get a chance. Thanks!

The way I did it was to set up a https website using nginx, with the specified certificate, and alias uwl.weblio.jp to localhost, then access it.
I think decoder had a slightly different method, but this one works too.

Thanks Valentin.
I was able to add the cert to a local apache instance, set up the hosts file to mimic that cert's domain, and connected successfully to my local site. I had to override an error message, as the cert itself is not trusted, but after that, no crash.
decoder - let me know if there's a better way to reproduce this.

I've tried going through this using nodejs + express and couldn't reproduce the issue either. Used the cert from [comment # 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427") and created a localhost using port 8000. Once accessed, I received an error message indicating that the cert wasn't trusted. After that, I couldn't reproduce the crash either.
I'll try using nginx and the STR :valentin posted in [comment #25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427")

I tried the following:
- installed nginx via Ubuntu 14.10
- changed -> ssl\_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/mutant1542.pem; (under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled)
- changed -> ssl\_certificate\_key /etc/nginx/ssl/mutant1542.pem; (under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled)
- Added "127.0.0.1 uwl.weblio.jp" into /etc/hosts
- Visiting <https://uwl.weblio.jp> would direct me to an "Untrusted website Exception" page
- Once the certificate was confirmed, <https://localhost> loaded without any crashes/issues
Valentin, does this seem correct? I've used linux asan builds from around June 12, June 16 and June 25.. Downloaded them from:

Setting qe-verify- due to lack of ability to reproduce issue. Feel free to ask for more help in verification if you are able to provide us with more information. See [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!! ASSERTION: Not a UTF-8 string. This code should only be used for converting from known UTF-8 strings.: 'Error', file dist/include/nsUTF8Utils.h, line 427") and [comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1026022#c28 "RESOLVED FIXED - ###!!!

I just saw this old needinfo for verification. This is a typical example for a bug that should not require manual verification at all. There is a simple testcase attached, which can be used in an xpcshell test to verify that the assertion does not happen anymore. You don't even need to add a complicated full-browser test for this. I suggest the developers add this test as a regression test.Flags: needinfo?(choller)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-65

## Certificate parsing broken by non-standard character encoding

Announced
July 22, 2014
Reporter
Christian Holler
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 31
* Thunderbird 31

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **Christian Holler** discovered
several issues while fuzzing the parsing of SSL certificates. Two of these
issues were a result of using characters that are not UTF-8 in certificates when
various functions expected all strings to be UTF-8 format. The third issue was a
result of using characters that were not ASCII in certificates while a function
expected only ASCII formatted text. All of these issues causes the certificates
to be incorrectly parsed, leading to a potential inability to use valid SSL
certificates.
