{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Active Directory distributes passwords that are configured using Group Policy preferences.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Passwords stored with Group Policy preferences are not securely encrypted, allowing an attacker to decrypt them."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could decrypt passwords and use them to elevate privileges on the domain. They could gain local or domain administrator credentials, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker would need to gain access to an authenticated user account on the domain.",
        "If a GPO is configured using Group Policy preferences to set a local administrative password or define credentials to map a network drive, schedule a task, or configure the running context of a service, an attacker could retrieve and decrypt the password."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the domain and have access to Group Policy preferences configurations."
