## Vulnerability in Group Policy Preferences Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2962486)

Published: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if Active Directory Group Policy preferences are used to distribute passwords across the domain - a practice that could allow an attacker to retrieve and decrypt the password stored with Group Policy preferences.

This security update is rated Important for Remote Server Administration Tools when installed on affected editions of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. The update is also rated Important for all affected editions of Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by removing the ability to configure and distribute passwords that use certain Group Policy preferences extensions. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Additional Action Required.** In order to be fully protected from the vulnerability addressed in this bulletin, customers with existing group policies that use Group Policy preferences will need to take additional action to remove those policies. See the **Vulnerability FAQ** in this bulletin for more information.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity and perform the additional actions detailed above and in the related FAQ.

The update is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) and [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96155) only.

## Group Policy Preferences Password Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2014-1812

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that Active Directory distributes passwords that are configured using Group Policy preferences. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could decrypt the passwords and use them to elevate privileges on the domain.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-1812](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1812).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* For workaround information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2962486](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2962486).

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way Active Directory distributes passwords that are configured using Group Policy preferences.

**What are Group Policy preferences?**

Group Policy preferences include more than 20 new Group Policy extensions that expand the range of configurable settings within a Group Policy object (GPO). These new extensions are included in the Group Policy Management Editor window of the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), under the new Preferences item. Examples of the new Group Policy preference extensions include folder options, mapped drives, printers, scheduled tasks, services, and Start menu settings. For more information about Group Policy Preferences, see [Group Policy Preferences Getting Started Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731892).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could acquire new local or domain administrator credentials and could use them to elevate privileges on the domain. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to gain access to an authenticated user account on the domain. If a GPO is configured using Group Policy preferences to set a local administrative password or define credentials to map a network drive, schedule a task, or configure the running context of a service, an attacker could then retrieve and decrypt the password stored with Group Policy preferences.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Servers acting as domain controllers are at most risk of exploitation from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the ability to configure and distribute passwords using the following Group Policy preferences extensions.

* Configuring Mapping Drives
* Configuring Local Users and Groups
* Configuring Scheduled Tasks
* Configuring Services
* Configuring Data Sources

**Additional Action Required:** It is important to note that the update does not remove any existing GPOs that were configured prior to the application of this security update. Customers with existing GPOs that were configured using the identified Group Policy preferences should remove this risk from their domain environment. See [Knowledge Base Article 2962486](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2962486) for more information.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-1812](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-1812).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Manage the software and security updates you need to deploy to the servers, desktop, and mobile systems in your organization. For more information see the [TechNet Update Management Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=69903). The [Microsoft TechNet Security website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21132) provides additional information about security in Microsoft products.

Security updates are available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129). You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for "security update."

Finally, security updates can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=96155). The Microsoft Update Catalog provides a searchable catalog of content made available through Windows Update and Microsoft Update, including security updates, drivers and service packs. By searching using the security bulletin number (such as, "MS14-001"), you can add all the applicable updates to your basket (including different languages for an update), and download to the folder of your choosing. For more information about the Microsoft Update Catalog, see the [Microsoft Update Catalog FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=97900).
