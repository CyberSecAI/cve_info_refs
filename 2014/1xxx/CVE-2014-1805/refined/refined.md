      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, gaining the same user rights. If the current user is an administrator, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. They would then need to convince a user to view the website. Alternatively, they could compromise existing websites or inject malicious content into sites that host user-provided content or advertisements.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a specially crafted or compromised web page via some form of social engineering, or have code injected into a commonly used website. They need no special privileges on the target system, but are more likely to be successful if the user has administrative privileges."
