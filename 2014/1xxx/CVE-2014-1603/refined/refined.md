The provided content relates to CVE-2014-1603.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization within the GetSimple CMS administrative console, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they access the vulnerable CMS. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user
- Stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, credentials)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable input fields within the GetSimple CMS admin console.
- The attacker can deliver the XSS payload using malicious links or by compromising the website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to input data within the administrative interface of GetSimple CMS.
- No special privileges within the application are necessary if the payload is injected using other means (e.g. via a malicious link), only that the victim is logged into the admin panel.
