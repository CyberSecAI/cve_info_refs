The provided content mentions CVE-2014-1711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Kernel Out-of-bounds (OOB) write in GPU driver.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Kernel OOB write.
**Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability allows for out-of-bounds write in the kernel, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or system instability.
**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the GPU driver, implying that the attack would involve exploiting this driver through a graphics API call.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the GPU driver, likely through a specifically crafted API call. This may require the ability to render or otherwise use the GPU.
