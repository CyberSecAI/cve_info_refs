Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The i-doit web application fails to properly encode user-supplied data when outputting it to the web page. Specifically, the 'call' parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper output encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's session.
- This allows for potential actions such as:
    - Impersonating the user, accessing their data.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirecting user to malicious sites.
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript within the 'call' parameter.
- The crafted URL is then sent or presented to a user. When the user clicks on the URL, the JavaScript code is executed within their browser session.
- Example vulnerable URL: `/?ajax=1&objID=1753&call=');}</script><script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into accessing the malicious URL. This could be achieved through phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or other social engineering techniques.
- No special privilege on the target system is needed.
