Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-1912:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `socket.recvfrom_into()` function of Python's socket module due to missing size validation of the supplied buffer.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `socket.recvfrom_into()` function does not check if the provided buffer is large enough to receive the data being read.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing:
    *   Denial of service (application crash)
    *   Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable Python code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network traffic received by a Python application using the vulnerable `socket.recvfrom_into()` function. This makes it remotely exploitable.
    *   Local exploitation if an attacker can control parameters when calling the function.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a python application using this function (remote), or control the parameters of the call (local).

**2. Affected Versions:**

*   Python versions from 2.5 to 2.7.6, and Python 3 prior to 3.3.4 are affected, as those are the ones which include the vulnerable function
*   Specific vulnerable versions mentioned include Python 2.7, Python 3.2, Python 3.3.
*   Specific products mentioned to be affected include:
    *   Oracle Linux
    *   Ubuntu (13.10, 12.10, 12.04, 10.04)
    *   openSUSE 12.3
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 through python and python-simplejson packages

**3. Fix Information:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Python versions 2.7.7, 3.3.4, and 3.4.0.
*   Patches were applied to `Modules/socketmodule.c` to add buffer size checks and test cases added to `Lib/test/test_socket.py`
*   Various Linux distributions released updated packages, as detailed in the provided advisories.

**4. Exploit Information:**

*   A proof-of-concept exploit script (pyrecvfrominto.py)  demonstrates the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted buffer to a server using the vulnerable function, ultimately triggering a crash or code execution.
*   The exploit leverages control over the ebx register, which then allows for control of eax and an indirect function call.
*   Some exploits use return oriented programming (ROP) to evade stack protections (NX)

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The `recvfrom_into` function is not frequently used within the Python standard library, which reduces the number of applications potentially exposed.
*   The bug could not be triggered in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 because it lacked the `recvfrom_into` function.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2014-1912 by MITRE.
*   Some Linux distributions have different ratings for this vulnerability with some being moderate and other being high.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in Python's `socket.recvfrom_into()`.
*   **Affected:** Python 2.5 - 2.7.6 and Python 3 prior to 3.3.4
*   **Cause:** Missing buffer size check in the function.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Exploit:** Remote through network traffic or local through controlled parameters to the function.
*   **Fix:** Updated Python versions 2.7.7, 3.3.4 and 3.4.0 and updated packages for multiple Linux distributions.

The Exploit-DB entry provides the most detailed technical description of how the buffer overflow can be exploited, while the other documents largely focus on the impact, affected systems, and fix information.
