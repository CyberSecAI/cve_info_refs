Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2014-1838**

*   **Root Cause:** The `extract_keys_from_pdf` and `fill_pdf` functions in `pdf_ext.py` within the `logilab-common` library use a hardcoded temporary file path `/tmp/toto.fdf`. This makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The code directly uses `/tmp/toto.fdf` without proper checks, making it susceptible to race conditions and symlink attacks.
    *   **Predictable File Name:** The usage of a hardcoded, predictable filename makes it easier for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker can create a symlink at `/tmp/toto.fdf` pointing to an arbitrary file. When the vulnerable functions are executed, they will overwrite the attacker's target file. This can lead to data loss or modification, and potentially to privilege escalation if the attacker can overwrite specific system files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create a symbolic link at `/tmp/toto.fdf` before the vulnerable code is executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local user privileges
    *   Ability to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory

**Summary of the vulnerability based on the provided information:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of a hardcoded temporary file name in the `/tmp` directory, specifically `/tmp/toto.fdf`. This allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink to a target file before the vulnerable code executes. This is due to a predictable file name and lack of proper checks when creating the temporary file.
