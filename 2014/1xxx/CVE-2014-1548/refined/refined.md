Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities, focusing on CVE-2014-1548:

**CVE-2014-1548 Analysis**

The primary source of information about CVE-2014-1548 comes from the bugzilla entry [Bug 1020041](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1020041). This bug report provides a much more granular view of the vulnerability than a typical CVE description.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `nsStandardURL::SetHost` function not properly validating the hostname, specifically when setting the host to '?'. When the pathname is then set, the URL is parsed incorrectly, interpreting '?' as the start of the query string rather than part of the host, leading to incorrect URL parsing. This ultimately results in a crash due to a bogus pointer being passed to `net_ToLowerCase`. The vulnerability is triggered when a web page directly exposes or manipulates the `nsIURI` interface, which was previously uncommon.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Improper input validation in `nsStandardURL::SetHost`.
    *   Incorrect parsing logic in nsStandardURL considering '?' in host as query string.
    *   The use of a potentially bogus pointer in a call to `net_ToLowerCase` function, leading to memory corruption.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   A crash can occur due to the use of a bogus pointer, leading to a denial of service. The crash signature points to an issue with nsStandardURL's handling of hostnames.
    *   Incorrect parsing of URLs leading to unexpected behaviour.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker can trigger this by crafting a malicious webpage that manipulates the URL using JavaScript and the `URL` API, setting a malformed host such as "?", which triggers the vulnerable code path in `nsStandardURL::SetHost`, then triggers the crash by modifying the pathname.
    *   The direct use of URL interface from web pages which were not meant to directly interact with `nsIURI` or related objects.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to serve a crafted webpage to a victim's browser which executes javascript. The attacker can achieve this by hosting the malicious code on an accessible webserver or through other attack vectors like cross site scripting, or malicous ads etc.

**Additional details from the bug report:**

*   The bug was introduced in Firefox 26 with changes related to `nsStandardURL`.
*   The vulnerability is marked as "sec-critical," highlighting the potential for exploitation.
*   The fix involved adding a check in `nsStandardURL::SetHost` to validate the hostname, specifically looking for characters like '/', '\', '?', and '#', and also moving the parsing logic to `FindHostLimit` function which limits the length of the string to be parsed.
*   The fix was uplifted to Firefox 31 and 32, as well as B2G versions.
*   The bug report also shows discussion regarding the proper behavior according to the WHATWG URL specification, which indicates that setting a host to "?" should result in an empty string hostname.
*   The bug is reproducible with the provided testcase which uses `url.host = '?'` and then `url.pathname = 'j'`

**Content from other sources:**

*   **gentoo.org security advisory GLSA 201504-01**: This document lists CVE-2014-1548 as a vulnerability affecting Firefox and other Mozilla products, and highlights that a remote attacker could use a specially crafted web page to cause arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which can be accomplished by having an end user visit a maliciously crafted web page.
*   **mozilla.org security advisory 2014-56**: This advisory mentions that CVE-2014-1548 was one of several memory safety issues fixed in Firefox 31.0 and it's predecessors, emphasizing the potential for arbitrary code execution if exploited.

**Summary of extracted information for CVE-2014-1548:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input validation when setting the hostname in `nsStandardURL::SetHost` using the URL API from Javascript, specifically when the host is set to '?'.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Improper handling of the '?' character within the host part of the URL, leading to incorrect parsing and memory corruption and ultimately a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service due to a crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious webpage served to an end user, which then manipulates the URL using javascript to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker must be able to serve a malicious website to the victim to trigger the vulnerability in the user's browser.

The information extracted from the bugzilla entry provides significantly more detail about the vulnerability, the specific code involved, and the development process behind the fix than a generic CVE description would typically provide.

**Other Vulnerabilities Identified**

The other bugzilla entries provide information on other distinct issues:

*   **Bug 1035438 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** A stack-buffer-overflow in `gfxUserFontSet::OTSMessage`, caused by a format string vulnerability when processing font files (more specifically with embedded tags). This is an issue in the embedded OTS library within Mozilla and the fix was to ensure the format specifier was limited to reading exactly 4 characters.
*   **Bug 1002702 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** An assertion failure in SharedWorker.cpp due to improper handling of `port.close()` during garbage collection.
*   **Bug 1009675 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** A crash in `mozilla::dom::WrapperPromiseCallback::Call` when commenting on github.com, resulting from a use-after-free condition.
*   **Bug 1009675 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** A crash due to incorrect rooting of values in JS engine code which can cause a crash on github.com
*   **Bug 1020008 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** An out-of-bounds read in `gfxPlatform::GetPrefLangName` due to an incorrect size check on an internal string array.
*   **Bug 994444 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** An infinite loop during bailouts to baseline with a `JSOP_LOOPENTRY` instruction, causing a denial of service.
*   **Bug 1021240 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** Calling alert from 'mozMediaStatisticsShowing' property getter freezes Firefox on MacOS due to incorrect handling of modal dialogues when the event loop is spun by XBL content. This led to a separate but related issue with data spoofing ([bug 1021969](#c0)).
*   **Bug 1022773 (CVE-NOT-ASSIGNED):** Fix for a static analysis that does not detect a return value held live across a GC.
