Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the history API in Maxthon Cloud Browser for Android. Specifically, the browser allowed manipulation of the address bar using the `history.back()` and `history.forward()` functions in conjunction with window.open() and location changes, leading to a mismatch between the displayed URL and the actual page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Address bar spoofing: The core vulnerability is the ability to manipulate the displayed URL in the address bar, leading users to believe they are on a different website than they actually are.
- Insecure use of history API: The browser did not properly sanitize or validate the changes made through the history API, allowing for the spoofing attack.
-  Lack of proper address bar update: The address bar was not updating correctly after the page navigation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create convincing phishing pages, tricking users into entering sensitive information on a fake website that appears legitimate.
- **Misinformation:**  Users might be misled about the content they are viewing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The attack vector is a specially crafted web page with Javascript code.
- **History API manipulation:** The attacker uses Javascript to manipulate the browser's history and address bar.
- **Timing:** The exploit relies on specific timing with `setTimeout` function to manipulate page history.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
- The user needs to open the malicious web page in a vulnerable version of the Maxthon browser on Android.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking on the link/button to execute the malicious Javascript code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Maxthon Cloud Browser for Android version 4.1.4.2000.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating how to perform the address bar spoofing.
- The vulnerability was silently fixed in version 4.1.5.2000 or 4.1.6.2000.
