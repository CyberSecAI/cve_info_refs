Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-1753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. This implies a flaw in how Internet Explorer manages memory allocation, access, or deallocation, leading to the possibility of overwriting critical data structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit the site. This can involve:
    *   Phishing emails or instant messages containing malicious links.
    *   Compromised websites hosting malicious content.
    *   Websites accepting user-provided content or advertisements that contain exploit code.
*   **Email Attachments:**  Attackers can send emails with malicious HTML attachments that, when opened with Internet Explorer, trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host or inject malicious content:**  The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a website a target user is likely to visit. Alternatively, they need to be able to send malicious HTML files via email.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content, such as clicking a link or opening a file.
*   **No user interaction is required after the webpage is loaded:** This vulnerability is triggered once the user opens the malicious content with IE.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" on affected Windows clients and "Moderate" on affected Windows servers.
*   The provided document lists multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-0325, CVE-2014-1751, CVE-2014-1752, CVE-2014-1753, CVE-2014-1755 and CVE-2014-1760) addressed by the same security update (MS14-018).
*   Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 are affected. Internet Explorer 10 is not affected by the memory corruption vulnerabilities, but it has a non-security update available through the same patch.
*   The document provides workarounds such as setting security levels to "High", disabling ActiveX and Active Scripting, or adding trusted sites to the trusted sites zone.
*   Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server mitigates the vulnerabilities, making servers less likely to be targeted.
