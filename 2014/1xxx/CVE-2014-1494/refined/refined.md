    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory safety problems and crashes in Firefox 27.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Memory safety issues leading to potential crashes and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Browsing a malicious web page with SVG content.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to lure the victim to visit a malicious web page."
