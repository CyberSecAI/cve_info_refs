Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)**. Specifically, user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being included in the generated web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS type. This means that the malicious script is injected within the user's request and returned within the page output, executing on the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser. This can have several consequences:
    *   **Data Theft:** An attacker can steal sensitive information such as session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    *   **Malware Installation:** The attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious website or trigger the download of malware.
    *   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the web page, potentially including phishing elements.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user sessions if session cookies are stolen.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the following parameters of specific pages:
    *   `filter_date_period` parameter
    *   `variable` parameter
    *  `operator` parameter
    *   The affected pages are:
        *   `/spywall/entSummary.php`
        *   `/spywall/custom_report.php`
        *   `/spywall/host_spy_report.php`
        *   `/spywall/repairedclients.php`

*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in one of the vulnerable parameters. They would then need to get a victim to click the URL. This could be done through phishing emails, social media, or malicious websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any prior credentials or access to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince a user to click on a malicious URL (e.g., by sending a phishing email or using social engineering to trick the user).

**Additional Notes**
* The provided content mentions that this vulnerability is present in "Symantec Web Gateway 5.1.1.24, and possibly earlier versions."
* The vendor was notified on February 25, 2014, and the document was updated on June 17, 2014.
