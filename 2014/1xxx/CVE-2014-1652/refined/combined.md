### Description

| **CVE-2014-1652 -** **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation**  Symantec Web Gateway 5.1.1.24, and possibly earlier versions, contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the filter\_date\_period, variable and operator parameters of the /spywall/entSummary.php, /spywall/custom\_report.php, /spywall/host\_spy\_report.php and /spywall/repairedclients.php pages.**CVE-2014-1651 -** **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command**Symantec Web Gateway 5.1.1.24, and possibly earlier versions, contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the hostname parameter of the clientreport.php page.Additional details may be found in [Symantec security advisory SYM14-010](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=securit%20y_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20140616_00).

| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to inject arbitrary script or SQL commands. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Symantec Web Gateway users should [upgrade to 5.2.1](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=securit%20y_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20140616_00) or later. Users can click “Check for Updates” on the Administration->Updates page to receive the fixed version. If you are unable to upgrade, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or SQLi attacks since the attack comes as a request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
