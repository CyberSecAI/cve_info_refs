{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when creating new pages. Specifically, it allows an attacker to define the `COMMAND_PATTERN` and `TEST_RUNNER` which can lead to arbitrary command execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Command Execution",
    "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to create a new page with malicious commands",
    "HTTP GET request to execute the commands by using `?test`"
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Fitnesse Wiki instance. No authentication is required."
