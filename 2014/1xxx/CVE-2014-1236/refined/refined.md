  "CVE-2014-1236": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the chkNum() function of Graphviz. The regular expression used to parse numbers allows for arbitrary long digit lists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input file, potentially leading to a denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the `chkNum` function due to a regular expression accepting arbitrarily long digit lists, leading to excessive data being copied to the buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted input file"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to control the input processed by Graphviz, either directly or by enticing a user to process a specially crafted file."
