Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-1551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an error in how DirectWrite font resources and tables are handled when rendering MathML content with specific fonts. Specifically, the `gfxDWriteFontEntry` object's `mFontFace` is reference counted, but the `FontTableRecord` which uses it isn't. The `FontTableRec()` destructor can be called after the `gfxDWriteFontEntry` destructor, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** A `DirectWrite font-face` object is freed while still being used, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The most immediate effect is a crash of the application.
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** While not explicitly confirmed, the use-after-free could be potentially exploited to execute arbitrary code. This is due to the fact that the `mFontFace->ReleaseFontTable()` is a virtual method and its vtable could potentially be overwritten. The crashes have also been observed with EXCEPTION_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION and EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ/WRITE/EXEC error codes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By rendering MathML content using a specific font on the Windows platform.
- The vulnerable code path exists within the DirectWrite component, which is Windows-specific, therefore the vulnerability does not affect OS X or Linux.
- While scripting is disabled in Thunderbird emails, the vulnerability is present within the browser contexts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the browser or browser-like context to render specific MathML content with a specially crafted font.
- The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious content through a website or other means to trigger the vulnerability in a user's browser.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported by James Kitchener.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 31, Firefox ESR 24.7, Thunderbird 24.7 and Thunderbird 31.
- The vulnerability is rated as critical.
- A test case and patch were developed to address the vulnerability.
- The patch was first applied to the trunk, and then uplifted to affected branches.
- Initially, only the code patch was applied, with the test case being held back until the vulnerability was publicly disclosed.
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems using DirectWrite.
- It was noted that similar issues could also affect SVGGlyphs code using the same SVG-in-OT font instantiated multiple times.
- The crash can occur during deferred deletion of cached objects.
- There was a concern about potential circular references with the fix, but it was deemed unlikely.
- There was also a discussion about the possibility of the vulnerability being exploitable beyond just causing a crash.
