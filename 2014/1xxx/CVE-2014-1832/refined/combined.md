Ah, nice catch Jakub. Needless to say, this is related to but
different from CVE-2013-4136.

One thing to notice, however, is that there's a race condition between
the stat check introduced in 34b1087870c2.
The following sequence still triggers the bogus behaviour:

<user> mkdir $dir
<phusion> lstat() (getFileTypeNoFollowSymlinks)
<user> rmdir $dir
<user> ln -s /target $dir
<phusion> stat() (from verifyDirectoryPermissions)
...

Use CVE-2014-1831 for the vulnerability with the "before 4.0.33"
affected versions.

Use CVE-2014-1832 for the vulnerability with the "4.0.33 and earlier"
affected versions.

This is an unusual situation because it depends on a decision about
whether the fix in version 4.0.33 solves part of the problem or
addresses one of the threat models. It also depends on whether two
CVEs should be used to cover a set of reports that are only relevant
to symlink attacks, but arguably have different flaw types.

CVE-2014-1831 requires the ability to create a symlink but apparently
does not require the ability to conduct the described race-condition
attack. The attacker could lack direct shell access, but have some
type of slow or limited access to the system. This could potentially
involve the ability to upload and run scripts that can create symlinks
but can't execute arbitrary commands or code. Alternatively, the
attacker could have access to a file manager with the same
constraints.

Also, in some cases, multiple CVEs are used in the case of a single
original report of a symlink-handling problem, e.g., CVE-2008-1569 and
CVE-2008-1570.

Source: ruby-passenger
Version: 4.0.35-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

Upstream has just committed a fix a security vulnerability:
<https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/34b1087870c2>

Quoting the NEWS file:

Urgency: low
Scope: local exploit
Summary: writing files to arbitrary directory by hijacking temp
directories
Affected versions: 4.0.5 and later
Fixed versions: 4.0.37

Description:
Phusion Passenger creates a "server instance directory" in /tmp during
startup, which is a temporary directory that Phusion Passenger uses to
store working files.  This directory is deleted after Phusion Passenger
exits. For various technical reasons, this directory must have a
semi-predictable filename. If a local attacker can predict this
filename, and precreates a symlink with the same filename that points to
an arbitrary directory with mode 755, owner root and group root, then
the attacker will succeed in making Phusion Passenger write files and
create subdirectories inside that target directory. The following
files/subdirectories are created:

* control_process.pid
* generation-X, where X is a number.

If you happen to have a file inside the target directory called
`control_process.pid`, then that file's contents are overwritten.

These files and directories are deleted during Phusion Passenger exit.
The target directory itself is not deleted, nor are any other contents
inside the target directory, although the symlink is.

Upstream has now fixed this with the following commit (basically using
the structure from lstat() for the two checks):

Note that while the original CVE request mentions version 4.0.33, that
seems like a typo as upstream NEWS file indicates: Fixed versions:
4.0.37.  Consequently, the above should be "before 4.0.37" and "4.0.37
and earlier" (or "before 4.0.38").

|  |  | \* Fixed a symlink-related security vulnerability. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Urgency: low |
|  |  | Scope: local exploit |
|  |  | Summary: writing files to arbitrary directory by hijacking temp directories |
|  |  | Affected versions: 4.0.37 |
|  |  | Fixed versions: 4.0.38 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Description: |
|  |  | This issue is related to the security issue as mentioned in the 4.0.37 |
|  |  | release notes. The previous fix was incomplete, and still has a |
|  |  | (albeit smaller) small attack time window in between two filesystem |
|  |  | checks. This attack window is now gone. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1058992#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-28 23:18:57 UTC  ``` An upstream commit [1] to the Passenger rubygem indicated that versions 4.0.5 and later are affected by a temporary file flaw described as follows:  " Phusion Passenger creates a "server instance directory" in /tmp during startup, which is a temporary directory that Phusion Passenger uses to store working files. This directory is deleted after Phusion Passenger exits. For various technical reasons, this directory must have a semi-predictable filename. If a local attacker can predict this filename, and precreates a symlink with the same filename that points to an arbitrary directory with mode 755, owner root and group root, then the attacker will succeed in making Phusion Passenger write files and create subdirectories inside that target directory. The following files/subdirectories are created:  * control_process.pid * generation-X, where X is a number.  If you happen to have a file inside the target directory called `control_process.pid`, then that file's contents are overwritten.  These files and directories are deleted during Phusion Passenger exit. The target directory itself is not deleted, nor are any other contents inside the target directory, although the symlink is. "  It is fixed in upstream version 4.0.33.  [1] <https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/34b1087870c2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1058992#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-28 23:20:37 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-passenger tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-20 [[bug 1058993](show_bug.cgi?id=1058993 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-passenger: insecure use of temporary files [fedora-20]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1058992#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-31 15:14:41 UTC  ``` This fix is also required:  <https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/94428057c602da3d6d34ef75c78091066ecac5c0>  MITRE has assigned two CVEs here:  Use [CVE-2014-1831](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1831) for the vulnerability with the "before 4.0.33" affected versions.  Use [CVE-2014-1832](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1832) for the vulnerability with the "4.0.33 and earlier" affected versions.   [CVE-2014-1831](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1831) would correspond to the original commit.  This second commit would correspond to [CVE-2014-1832](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1832) because "there's a race condition between the stat check introduced in 34b1087870c2" [1].  So both CVEs are applicable here, so noting them both.
