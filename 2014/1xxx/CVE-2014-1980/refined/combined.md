[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |

Base Score:4.3
