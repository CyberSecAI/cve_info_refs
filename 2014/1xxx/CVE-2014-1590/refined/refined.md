Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` method in Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey) improperly handles crafted JavaScript objects that mimic input streams, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of JavaScript objects passed as input streams to XMLHttpRequest.
- Lack of sufficient checks on the object's type.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafted javascript objects which mimic input streams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash).
- The crash is described as non-exploitable in terms of code execution. However the crash can be used for DoS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based and requires a remote attacker to send a crafted JavaScript object to the vulnerable function.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting an object and using `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` method to pass the malicious input stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network requests, most likely via a malicious web page or a malicious email (in contexts where scripting is enabled).
- The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was reported by security researcher Joe Vennix from Rapid7.
-  The vulnerability is present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS, SeaMonkey and Thunderbird.
- The vulnerability is mitigated in Thunderbird by disabling scripting, however a browser like context is still a risk.
- The fix for this issue involves checking if an object being passed to `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` is an XPConnect wrapped input stream and rejecting it.
- The issue is considered a moderate security risk, as it only causes a denial of service and does not lead to arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of the affected products.

The information in the documents provides more details than the description on the CVE page as it specifies the vulnerable method and how crafted input can trigger the crash. It also shows that the vulnerability can be triggered using different methods of passing a malicious input stream, using Proxy objects.
