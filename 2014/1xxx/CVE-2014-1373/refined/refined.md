- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A validation issue existed in the handling of an OpenGL API call in the Intel Graphics Driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient bounds checking during the processing of OpenGL API calls.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application exploiting a flaw in the processing of an OpenGL API call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the target system.
