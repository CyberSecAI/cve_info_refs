{
  "CVE-2014-1609": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `db_query()` instead of `db_query_bound()` in multiple locations within the MantisBT codebase. `db_query()` does not sanitize input, allowing for SQL injection.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in SQL queries.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete control of the application's database.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerable code is located in multiple PHP files of the MantisBT project, including the SOAP API, core functionalities, and plugins. It's exploitable via specially crafted input to the `mc_project_get_attachments`, `news_get_limited_rows`, `summary_print_by_enum`, `summary_print_by_age`, `summary_print_by_developer`, `summary_print_by_reporter`, `summary_print_by_category`, `create_bug_enum_summary`, `enum_bug_group`, `bug_graph_bycategory.php`, `bug_graph_bystatus.php` and `proj_doc_page.php` functions.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable functions. For the SOAP API, they need to have access to the API endpoints. No specific user role is required to exploit the vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the use of `db_query()` instead of `db_query_bound()` in `mc_project_get_attachments` in `api/soap/mc_project_api.php`, and other locations which leads to unsanitized parameters being passed directly into SQL queries.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands against the MantisBT database leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or complete control of the database.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerable code is present in the SOAP API (`api/soap/mc_project_api.php`) and other files, specifically within the `mc_project_get_attachments` function which is accessible through the SOAP API.  The attacker can exploit this through crafting a malicious `project_id` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the SOAP API of MantisBT. No specific user role is required to exploit the vulnerability, potentially any user with SOAP API access or any user able to send SOAP requests may be capable of triggering this."
