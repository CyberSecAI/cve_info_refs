Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An uninitialized memory access issue existed in the handling of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) messages within a TLS (Transport Layer Security) connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Uninitialized memory access: The vulnerability stems from the software attempting to access memory that has not been properly initialized. This can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could potentially disclose two bytes of memory. While the size of the disclosure is small, the data revealed could contain sensitive information, such as session data, that could aid in further attacks, or reveal system information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **DTLS in TLS Connection:** The vulnerability is triggered when handling DTLS messages within a TLS connection. This means an attacker would need to initiate or be part of an active TLS connection using DTLS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate over the network to initiate a TLS connection and send DTLS messages.
*   **TLS Connection:** An attacker would need to be in a position to initiate or interact with an existing TLS connection where DTLS might be used.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was addressed by only accepting DTLS messages in a DTLS connection. This suggests that the vulnerability involved the software incorrectly processing DTLS packets in a connection that was not expecting them (i.e., a TLS connection).
* The vulnerability was reported by Thijs Alkemade of The Adium Project.
