      "description": "The vulnerability is due to memory not being properly initialized when a malformed GIF image is repeatedly rendered within a `<canvas>` element. This can potentially lead to data leakage to web content.",
      "root_cause": "Uninitialized memory usage when rendering malformed GIFs within a `<canvas>` element.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "Potential for data leakage to web content due to the use of uninitialized memory.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Enticing a user to view a specially crafted web page containing a malformed GIF that is rendered repeatedly within a `<canvas>` element"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious web page or embed the malicious content in a page that a user visits.",
	  "details":"The vulnerability occurs because `SourceSurfaceAlignedRawData` does not zero its buffer when initialized. `RasterImage::CopyFrame` calls `Factory::CreateDataSourceSurface` which setups a `SourceSurfaceAlignedRawData`. This can lead to data leakage because the uninitialized memory is used during rendering. The most efficient fix is to use `calloc` for zeroed buffers, as the OS often provides zeroed pages for larger allocations, making a separate memset unnecessary."
