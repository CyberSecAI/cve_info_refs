CVE-2014-1226 s3dvt Root shell (still)

About s3dvt:

s3dvt is part of the 3d network display server which can be used as
3d desktop environment.

Vulnerability:

The s3dvt developers forgot to review all the code. There is still a
vulnerable function as in the previous CVE-2013-6825. At the date of
July 1, 2014 the last commit of the s3dvt is still vulnerable and
exploitable. Commit: 1e9c9c53fa192cbf4f79d724b5e6c76374516968

Details, patches, discussion and strategy to exploit at:
<http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2014-1226-s3dvt_0.2.2-root-shell.html>

Because we found a bug in bash <= 4.3 this vulnerability can be
successfully exploited. Bash bug details at:
<http://hmarco.org/bugs/bash_4.3-setuid-bug.html>

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Jun 1, 2014 the last commit of the s3dvt is still vulnerable and
exploitable. Commit: 1e9c9c53fa192cbf4f79d724b5e6c76374516968

Details, patches, discussion and strategy to exploit at:
<http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2014-1226-s3dvt_0.2.2-root-shell.html>

Because we found a bug in bash <= 4.3 this vulnerability can be
successfully exploited. Bash bug details at:

# CVE-2014-1226 - s3dvt - root shell ---

| Authors: | [Hector Marco](http://hmarco.org) & [Ismael Ripoll](http://personales.upv.es/~iripoll/) |
| --- | --- |
| CVE: | CVE-2014-1226 |
| BUG: | Lack of checking setuid() return code |
| Dates: | 25 March 2014 - Public disclosure |

## Description

The **s3dvt developers** forgot to review all the code.
There is still a vulnerable function as in the previous
[CVE-2013-6876 - s3dvt\_0.2.2 root shell](s3dvt_0.2.2-root-shell.html) vulnerability.

The bug as previous one is caused by not checking the
return values of setuid() and getuid() calls.
The process must not continue its normal execution when any of
these calls fail (return an error) to drop privileges.

## Impact

The drop privileges in **s3dvt** has the purpose to prevent
to execute the bash with root privileges. In the cases where
the application is installed with set bit setuid a
non-privileged user could obtain a root shell.

Because the [bash
setuid() bug](bash_4.3-setuid-bug.html) this bug can be exploited successfully. See
discussion section.

## Vulnerable packages

**s3dvt** package 0.2.2 is vulnerable. From the first
commit on January 2006 to the current 0.2.2 (released May 2011)
are also affected. At the date of Jun 1, 2014 the last commit of the
s3dvt (1e9c9c53fa192cbf4f79d724b5e6c76374516968) version **is still
vulnerable and exploitable**.
## The bug

The **bug is still present** because during the
discussion with the authors we always were referring to a
concrete function for simplicity but the application had two
vulnerable functions with the bug. They decide stop reply ours
emails and only fix one function. See discussion.

The bug appears because the return value of the
setuid() call is not checked. When
the setuid() fails, the application continue
executing (does not terminate) and the following code is
executed with the original privileges. In this case it is
possible to obtain a **root shell**.

The bug appears in apps/s3dvt/main.c file, on lines
231 and 232:

```

static int pipe_init_terminal(void)
{
        int uid = 0, gid = 0;
        const char *exe = "/bin/bash";
        const char *args = "-i";
        ...
        uid = getuid();
        gid = getgid();
        pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) { /*  the child */
                char tmpstr[1024];
                setuid(uid);
                setgid(gid);
                ...
                execl(exe, exe, args, NULL);
                ...
        }
}

```

## Exploit

The strategy to exploit this kind of bugs
consists in creating as many processes as the target user is
allowed to make (which is given by RLIMIT\_NPROC), and then the
next attempt to drop privileges will fail, letting the process
alive and with the original privileges.

## FIX

We have created a non official patch for **s3dvt**
0.2.2:
```

diff --git apps/s3dvt/main.c apps/s3dvt/main.c

Patching s3dvt-0.2.2:
```

$ wget http://hmarco.org/bugs/patches/s3dvt-fix-setuid-pipe-terminal.patch
$ cd s3dvt-0.2.2

```

## Discussion

This bug can be exploited because the there is a similar bug
in the code of the bash. And so, an attacker can
bypass/exploit both bugs to raise privileges.

See discussion section in
[CVE-2013-6876 - s3dvt\_0.2.2 root shell](s3dvt_0.2.2-root-shell.html).

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.
