  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can monitor the process tree and steal the API key, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the New Relic service and associated data/actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Monitoring the process tree on the system where the vulnerable code is executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to monitor the process tree on the system where the vulnerable `paratrooper-newrelic` gem is used."
