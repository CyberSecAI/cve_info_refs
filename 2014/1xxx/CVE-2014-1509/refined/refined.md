  "CVE-2014-1509": {
    "description": "A memory corruption flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain PDF files. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a malicious extension could use this flaw to crash Firefox or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Memory corruption in the Cairo graphics library during font rendering of a PDF file due to a buffer overflow when processing truetype fonts with DirectWrite. Specifically, the function `_cairo_dwrite_load_truetype_table` in the Cairo library did not properly respect the buffer length and offset parameters, leading to a stack overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious extension",
        "Specially crafted PDF file with truetype fonts using DirectWrite on Windows",
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious extension and then open a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when rendered using DirectWrite."
