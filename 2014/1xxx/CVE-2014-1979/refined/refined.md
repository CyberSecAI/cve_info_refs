Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how NTT DOCOMO's sp mode mail application processes "Deco-mail" emoticons, specifically the POP (presumably a type of data or markup) associated with them. This improper processing allows for the execution of arbitrary Java methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Java Method Execution:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to execute arbitrary Java methods within the context of the sp mode mail application. This implies a lack of proper input validation or sanitization when processing the Deco-mail emoticon POP.
- **Design Error**: The JVN iPedia entry classifies this as a design error, meaning the vulnerability exists not because of implementation flaws, but due to a flaw in the initial design.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a special email with malicious Deco-mail content, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary Java methods. This means they can potentially perform any action that the sp mode mail application is authorized to perform, depending on the available API methods within the application.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:** The CVSS v2 score indicates that the vulnerability has a "Partial" impact on Confidentiality and Integrity. This implies that the attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data and/or modify data within the application's scope.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted emails. The attacker sends an email containing malicious Deco-mail emoticons.
- **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network, as the malicious email can be sent through normal email protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious email.
- **Email Sending Capability:**  The attacker must be able to send emails to the targeted user's email account.
- **Crafted Email:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious email that exploits the vulnerable Deco-mail parsing logic.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects sp mode mail rev.5900 through rev.6300 for Android 4.0.X and earlier, and sp mode mail rev.6000 through rev.6620 for Android 4.1 and later.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires the user to open the specially crafted email for the exploit to be triggered.
- **Complexity:** The analysis by JPCERT/CC indicates a "Mid-High" level of complexity for exploitation, implying some expertise or luck may be required.
- **CWE Mapping:**  The JVN iPedia entry maps this to "CWE-DesignError" indicating an issue originating from the design rather than implementation.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain control over the execution context of the sp mode mail application through a specially crafted email, potentially leading to information disclosure and data manipulation within the application.
