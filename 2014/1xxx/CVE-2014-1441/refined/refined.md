Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a race condition in the processing of the "AUTH SSL" command in Core FTP Server. When the server receives the "AUTH SSL" command followed by invalid SSL data, a race condition occurs leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition that is triggered by sending invalid data after the "AUTH SSL" command.
- **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The server does not handle the invalid SSL data correctly, resulting in a crash instead of a graceful error response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send a crafted sequence of commands to the server, forcing it to crash. This leads to a denial of service, making the FTP server unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **FTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered using the FTP protocol and the "AUTH SSL" command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server over the network.
- **Knowledge of FTP:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of the FTP protocol and be able to send commands.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending the "AUTH SSL" command followed by invalid data, specifically, hitting the "enter" key twice after the command.
- The vulnerability is present in Core FTP Server software (Version 1.2, build 511, 32-bit).
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-617: Reachable Assertion.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in later builds of Core FTP Server.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Luciano Martins from Deloitte.
