  "CVE-2014-1511": {
    "description": "Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski, via TippingPoint's Pwn2Own contest, reported that it is possible for untrusted web content to load a chrome-privileged page by getting JavaScript-implemented WebIDL to call window.open(). A second bug allowed the bypassing of the popup-blocker. Combined these two bugs allow an attacker to load a JavaScript URL that is executed with the full privileges of the browser, which allows arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerability": "A combination of two vulnerabilities: the ability to load chrome-privileged page from untrusted web content and a pop-up blocker bypass.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the full privileges of the browser.",
    "attack_vector": "Untrusted web content",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to load a webpage with malicious code. No user interaction required.",
      "additional_details": "This flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled.  The vulnerability is triggered by getting Javascript-implemented WebIDL to call window.open().  The second bug bypasses the popup-blocker without user interaction."
