Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the Chinese (Simplified) Grammar Checker feature in Microsoft Office does not properly validate file paths when loading external libraries (DLL files).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of file paths when loading external libraries.
- Uncontrolled search path vulnerability: The application attempts to load a DLL without proper validation of its location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Share/UNC/WebDAV: An attacker places a malicious DLL and a legitimate Office file in a shared network location (SMB, UNC path, or WebDAV share) and convinces the user to open the file.
- Email Attachment: The attacker sends the user an Office file along with instructions to place the attachment in a folder containing a malicious DLL, and then convince them to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to place a malicious DLL file and a legitimate Office file on a network share, UNC path, or WebDAV share.
- Ability to convince a user to open the legitimate Office file from that location (or from a local directory with a malicious DLL).
- An understanding of which language proofing tool is enabled in Microsoft Office

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects systems with the Chinese (Simplified) Grammar Checker feature enabled.
- The vulnerability is related to a class of vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637, which deals with how applications load external libraries.
- The vulnerability is not related to CVE-2014-1808, which concerns an information disclosure vulnerability related to token reuse.
- Workarounds include disabling the loading of libraries from remote shares and disabling the WebClient service.
- Firewall rules for blocking ports 139 and 445 can mitigate attacks in a network environment.
