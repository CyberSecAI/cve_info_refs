**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Denial of service vulnerability due to the lack of file size limits when uploading via the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can upload arbitrarily large files, potentially filling up all available storage space on the device, leading to a denial of service. This can prevent further uploads and impact device usability.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a large file through the web interface provided by the iThoughts web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network and able to access the iThoughts web server via a browser. The iThoughts web server (wifi sharing) must be enabled on the device for the vulnerability to be exposed.
