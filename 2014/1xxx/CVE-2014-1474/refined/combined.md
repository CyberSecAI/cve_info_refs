RT 4.2.5 -- 2014-06-12
----------------------

We are pleased to announce that RT 4.2.5 is now available.

4205a7fa678c4476e23fe8042955ac37c19cebf0  rt-4.2.5.tar.gz.asc

This release is primarily a bugfix release; most notably, it explicitly
updates a dependency to fix a previously-announced security
vulnerability, resolves two serious bugs in the serializer, and fixes
the "paste" feature in the Rich Text editor.

Updated dependencies
 * Updated Email::Address::List dependency, to resolve CVE-2014-1474,
   as was previously announced in
   <http://blog.bestpractical.com/2014/01/security-vulnerability-in-rt-42.html>
 * Bump CGI dependency (under perl 5.20 and above, only) to quash
   warnings about CGI.pm's deprecation in core (#29053)

Serializer/Importer
 * Serialize binary data as binary, not as UTF-8 codepoints; this fixes
   a regression introduced in 4.2.3 which corrupted all binary data in
   serialized data.
 * Serialize ObjectScrips when cloning, which had been mistakenly
   omitted; this only partially resolves #29949, as it does not address
   serialization of ObjectScrips when not cloning.

General web UI
 * Force CKEDITOR_BASEPATH; this fixes errors during pasting into the
   Rich Text editor (#29780, #29987)
 * Ticket autocompletion (for links) is more predictable when completing
   on strings containing numbers (#25755)
 * Fix "Show Outgoing Email" and Reply/Comment/Forward links in
   Approvals (#29800)
 * Correctly decode text/html parts of old (RT 3.6.5 and prior) emails

Internationalization
 * Updated localizations (German, Greek, Slovak, Lithuanian)

Web administration
 * Display clean Stage name in ColumnMaps (#28739)
 * Add Scrips Select/Create menu, and maintain context on which list of
   Scrips the Select page should link to (#28787)
 * Granting rights to new groups no longer requires clicking in textbox
   twice in Firefox (#29911)

Server administration
 * Log when Encode::HanExtra would be useful in decoding emails, and
   make use of it if it is available.
 * Squash warnings in 4.1.17 upgrade step (#29595)
 * Reorder DROP IF EXISTS on 4.1.1 Postgres upgrade step to drop
   sequence after dropping the table; avoids bugs on upgrading in a
   previously-upgraded database
 * Stop hardcoding the list of available themes, instead auto-detecting
   new themes as they are added (#14667)
 * Explicitly point to $AutocompleteOwners setting in warning that RT is
   switching to the autocompleter due to too many owners.
 * Remove caching of template object in rt-crontool; this fixes a bug
   where the same content would be sent on all tickets (#29454)
 * rt-fulltext-indexer now locks, to prevent more than one instance from
   running at once (#17423)

Developer
 * Add BeforeMessageBox callback in ModifyAll.html for parity with
   Create.html and Update.html
 * BeforeCustomFields callback in ShowCustomFields now takes $Table parameter
 * Default callback in ShowTransaction can now modify $ShowBody
 * Add a RT::Date->IsSet method
 * Fix invalid ContextObject on RT::CustomField->LoadByName when passed
   Queue => 0; this led to invalid LookupType limits on later calls to
   ->LoadByName.
 * Generalize RT::CustomField->LoadByName to work with non-Queue context
   objects, and to optionally return globally-applied CFs and not
   Disabled CFs.
 * Tests now pass again using RT_TEST_WEB_HANDLER=inline
 * ->AddCustomFieldValues no longer allows adding repeated values (#4553)

Documentation
 * Drop references to MySQL 4.1, as RT 4.2 requires MySQL 5.1
 * Updated example plugins used in documentation, and suggest Plugin()
   over Set(@Plugins, ...)  (#29978)
 * Documentation for ColumnMap

A complete changelog is available from git by running:
    git log rt-4.2.4..rt-4.2.5
or visiting
    <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/compare/rt-4.2.4...rt-4.2.5>

# [Security vulnerability in RT 4.2](/blog/2014/01/security-vulnerability-in-rt-42)

[January 27, 2014](/blog/2014/01/security-vulnerability-in-rt-42)

[Alex Vandiver](/blog?author=56b4ec420c4a68f5ea9258c5)

[Announcements](/blog/category/Announcements), [RT](/blog/category/RT)

Versions of RT between 4.2.0 and 4.2.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to adenial-of-service attack via the email gateway; any installation which
accepts mail from untrusted sources is vulnerable, regardless of the
permissions configuration inside RT. This vulnerability is assigned
[CVE-2014-1474](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1474).

This vulnerability is caused by poor parsing performance in the
Email::Address::List module, which RT depends on. We recommend that
affected users upgrade their version of [Email::Address::List](https://metacpan.org/release/Email-Address-List) to v0.02 or
above, which resolves the issue.

After extracting the contents, the module can be installed by running:
> ```
> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install
> ```

The first step should be sure to use the same perl that RT runs using.
If you are unsure, the first line of /opt/rt4/sbin/standalone\_httpd
should contain the full path to the relevant perl binary. The last step
will likely need to be run with root permissions. After this process,
you should restart your webserver.

If you need help resolving this issue locally, we will provide
discounted pricing for single-incident support; please contact us at
sales@bestpractical.com for more information.
