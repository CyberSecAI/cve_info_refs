Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-1474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inefficient parsing within the `Email::Address::List` module when handling strings that do not contain valid email addresses. This inefficient parsing leads to a quadratic-time check, causing a significant performance degradation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Quadratic time complexity in the parsing logic of the `Email::Address::List` module when processing invalid email address strings.
- Lack of proper input validation or efficient algorithm for handling malformed email address inputs

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By sending specially crafted or malformed email addresses, an attacker can cause the vulnerable system to consume excessive resources (CPU time), leading to a slowdown or complete unavailability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending email messages with invalid or specially crafted email address strings to an RT (Request Tracker) instance, which uses the vulnerable `Email::Address::List` module to process the email headers.
- Any process that parses email addresses using the vulnerable `Email::Address::List` module can be targeted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable system.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, as long as the system accepts mail from untrusted sources.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RT (Request Tracker) versions between 4.2.0 and 4.2.2 (inclusive).
- The fix involves upgrading the `Email::Address::List` module to version 0.02 or higher, which includes a fix for the quadratic time complexity issue.
- The vulnerability is specifically a performance issue.
