# [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2014-002 - Anonymous Posting - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

---

*From*: security-news () drupal org

*Date*: Wed, 15 Jan 2014 21:16:59 +0000 (UTC)

---

```
View online: <https://drupal.org/node/2173321>

   * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2014-002
   * Project: Anonymous Posting [1] (third-party module)
   * Version: 7.x
   * Date: 2014-01-15
   * Security risk: Moderately critical [2]
   * Exploitable from: Remote
   * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

This module allows anonymous users to fill in their contact information
(name, email and homepage) when posting any content type including Forum
Topics. This allows the submitted name to be shown instead of the usual
anonymous string provided by Drupal core.

The module doesn't properly sanitize the name submitted by the anonymous user
before it is output.

This vulnerability is mitigated only by the fact that use of anonymous
posting data must be enabled on a per content type basis by a user with
permission to do so since it is not enabled by default. However when
configured for it's intended purpose, the vulnerability is not mitigated.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

   * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
     accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

   * Anonymous Posting 7.x-1.x versions 7.x-1.2 and 7.x-1.3

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Anonymous
Posting [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

   * Install the latest version: 7.x-1.4 [5]

Also see the Anonymous Posting [6] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY
---------------------------------------------------------

   * drikc [7] the module maintainer

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

   * drikc [8] the module maintainer

-------- COORDINATED BY
------------------------------------------------------

   * Rick Manelius [9] provisional member of the Drupal Security Team

-------- CONTACT AND MORE INFORMATION

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
