Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Drupal Anonymous Posting module fails to properly sanitize user-submitted names before displaying them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The module outputs user-provided data (the anonymous user's name) without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the name field which would then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the content with the attacker-supplied name. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the site, or other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker would submit a malicious name string through the anonymous posting form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to post content using the anonymous posting feature. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, requiring no special privileges other than the ability to submit content on a website with the vulnerable module enabled. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in Anonymous Posting module versions 7.x-1.2 and 7.x-1.3.
* It is mitigated by the fact that anonymous posting is not enabled by default and needs to be enabled on a per-content type basis by an administrator.
* The fix is available in version 7.x-1.4 of the module.
