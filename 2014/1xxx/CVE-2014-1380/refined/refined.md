- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Under rare circumstances, the screen lock did not intercept keystrokes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to properly intercept and manage keystrokes when the screen is locked.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could type into windows that are under the screen lock.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the machine with the screen locked.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to type on the keyboard of a locked device.
