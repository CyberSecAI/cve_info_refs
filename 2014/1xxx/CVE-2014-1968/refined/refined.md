Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input when generating output on web pages. Specifically, the XooNIps module does not adequately sanitize or encode input strings before displaying them in the web browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they interact with a page containing the injected malicious code.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies/session tokens, defacing websites, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be conducted remotely over the network.
- It doesn't require authentication (anonymous access is possible)
- It requires some user interaction, for example convincing a user to click on a link or view a page where the malicious script is embedded.
- The attacker needs to inject the malicious script into user-supplied data processed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to inject malicious script into a data input field or a parameter that is later reflected in the web page. This may be through a comment, user profile, search query, or any other method where the user-supplied data is rendered on the page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to rely on the user clicking on the crafted link or accessing a manipulated web page to execute the script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects XooNIps version 3.47 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a medium severity with a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3.
