- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Session cookies may persist even after resetting Safari.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Safari session cookies were not always deleted until Safari was closed after a reset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Session cookies may persist after resetting Safari which could lead to unauthorized access to user's sessions on websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by resetting Safari.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have access to a system where Safari was reset, but not closed to potentially exploit this vulnerability.
