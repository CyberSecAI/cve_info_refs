```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a result of a timing attack mechanism related to SVG filters and the feDisplacementMap. Displacements within feDisplacementMap could be correlated with values derived from content, potentially leading to information disclosure. This is due to the fact that these displacements control memory fetches into another input image and differences in fetch speed due to cache effects can be measured by attackers.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Timing attack vulnerability, information disclosure, possible cross-domain data leakage. The core issue lies in the way feDisplacementMap processes displacements which is not checked for taintedness, allowing for timing attacks to potentially reveal information about the contents of the displacement.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially steal confidential information across domains (text values) by exploiting the timing differences in how the SVG filter is processed. This is done by correlating the displacement with the content.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector involves an attacker crafting malicious SVG content containing filters and feDisplacementMap. By timing how the feDisplacementMap processes the displacements into the other image, an attacker can steal data values.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted SVG image and monitor the timing of its processing. User interaction may be required. The attacker needs knowledge about how feDisplacementMap affects memory access times. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform the attack. User is required to have scripting enabled.
