{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "MumbleKit failed to properly validate the length prefix of received Opus voice packets. If an Opus packet with an invalid length prefix was received, MumbleKit would attempt to extract it using an MKPacketDataStream object's copyDataBlock: method. When the copyDataBlock: method fails, it returns nil without performing error checking. The returned nil object was then used in subsequent calls to Opus functions which then dereferenced the NULL pointer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation of Opus packet length prefix.",
    "Lack of NULL pointer check after failed data extraction."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malformed Opus voice packet sent to a MumbleKit client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference, causing a client crash (Denial of Service).",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker participating in a Mumble voice chat can send a malformed Opus voice packet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to participate in a Mumble voice chat and send a malformed Opus voice packet to the vulnerable client."
