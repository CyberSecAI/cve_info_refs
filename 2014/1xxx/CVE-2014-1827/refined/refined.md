- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize file names being uploaded through the web interface when the iThoughts web server is turned on.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null byte injection, leading to arbitrary file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass file type restrictions and upload files of any type to the iThoughts web server.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading a file with a crafted name containing a null byte through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device and the iThoughts web server (WiFi sharing) must be turned on.
