# USN-2372-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 October 2014

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Bobby Holley, Christian Holler, David Bolter, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard,

Carsten Book, Martijn Wargers, Shih-Chiang Chien, Terrence Cole and

Jeff Walden discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1574](/security/CVE-2014-1574), [CVE-2014-1575](/security/CVE-2014-1575))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during CSS manipulation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1576](/security/CVE-2014-1576))

Holger Fuhrmannek discovered an out-of-bounds read with Web Audio. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information.

([CVE-2014-1577](/security/CVE-2014-1577))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds write when buffering WebM video

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1578](/security/CVE-2014-1578))

Michal Zalewski discovered that memory may not be correctly initialized

when rendering a malformed GIF in to a canvas in some circumstances. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information.

([CVE-2014-1580](/security/CVE-2014-1580))

A use-after-free was discovered during text layout in some circumstances.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1581](/security/CVE-2014-1581))

Patrick McManus and David Keeler discovered 2 issues that could result

in certificate pinning being bypassed in some circumstances. An attacker

with a fraudulent certificate could potentially exploit this conduct a

machine-in-the-middle attack. ([CVE-2014-1582](/security/CVE-2014-1582), [CVE-2014-1584](/security/CVE-2014-1584))

Eric Shepherd and Jan-Ivar Bruaroey discovered issues with video sharing

via WebRTC in iframes, where video continues to be shared after being

stopped and navigating to a new site doesn't turn off the camera. An

attacker could potentially exploit this to access the camera without the

user being aware. ([CVE-2014-1585](/security/CVE-2014-1585), [CVE-2014-1586](/security/CVE-2014-1586))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that webapps could use the Alarm API to read the

values of cross-origin references. If a user were tricked in to installing

a specially crafter webapp, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2014-1583](/security/CVE-2014-1583))

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2014-80

## Key pinning bypasses

Announced
October 14, 2014
Reporter
Patrick McManus, David Keeler
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 33
* SeaMonkey 2.30

### Description

Mozilla developer **Patrick McManus** reported a method to use
SPDY or HTTP/2 connection coalescing to bypass key pinning on different sites
that resolve to the same IP address.This could allow the use of a fraudulent certificate when a saved pin for that subdomain should have prevented the connection. This leads to possible man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker has control of the DNS connection and the ability to obtain a fraudulent certificate that browsers would accept in the absence of the pin.

Mozilla security engineer **David Keeler** discovered that when
there are specific problems verifying the issuer of an SSL certificate, the
checks necessary for key pinning would not be run. As a result, the user is then
presented with the "Untrusted Connection" error page, which they can use to bypass the key pinning process on a site that should be pinned. This error message is always shown to the user and cannot be used to silently bypass key pinning on affected sites.

Key pinning was first introduced in Firefox 32 and currently only covers a small number of built-in sites.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049095#c0)• 10 years ago |
|  | |

I was informed of a potential key pinning bypass attack that I can confirm we are vulnerable to. The attack uses spdy/h2 connection-coalescing to bypass the key pin.
Assume a.example.com is pinned to key-a and b.example.com is pinned to key-b
1] goto host <https://a.example.com/> - it has a cert valid for \*.example.com on 1.1.1.1 and uses key-a.. it negotiates a spdy connection that stays alive.
2] ask for <https://b.example.com/> - it resolves also to 1.1.1.1. Under the spdy/h2 coalescing rules b can use the spdy connection from step 1 because it is the same host (1.1.1.1) and that connection has a valid cert for b.example.com (it was a wildcard) so it can be "joined"
the problem is that b.example.com/ is dispatched on the connection that used key-a and b is supposed to be pinned to key-b.
Before the "joining" we can just check if the connection from step 1 has a full cert chain that satisfies any pins for b.example.com - unfortunately getting the full cert chain requires some work especially with resumed connections ([bug 731478](/show_bug.cgi?id=731478 "NEW - Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in SSL session ID"))
Realistically, this is probably not a big problem because the configuration is somewhat non-sensical. If these hosts are really eligible for coalescing (which is being done now on <=ff31 which doesn't have any key pinning checks) then you would expect they would be pinned to the same key.
The inclination between keeler, monica, and myself was to try and get this in 34 and ride the trains with the fix.

I just told Garrett about this bug and his initial thought was that the stuff that he is doing for ssl error reporting is easy to modify to carry along the cert chain regardless of verification success or failure.

Consider a connection to <https://attacker.com/>, which has a certificate with SANs for both attacker.com and victim.com. The attacker is MitMing your DNS so that DNS resolves to the same IP address for both. Thus, the attacker can now induce Firefox to coalesce victim.com onto attacker.com's connection, regardless of pinning. The attack requires a trusted CA to issue a certificate with SANs for both attacker.com and victim.com, but that's exactly the type of problem (mis-issuance) that key pinning is supposed to protect websites from.

Indeed. How far back does this go? I'm guessing that this is going to affect SPDY all the way back. HTTP/2 bothers me less, since it's still off by default.
We should probably consider uplift for SPDY.

We don't have any key pinning, as I understand it, until firefox-32 (on beta).

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=8475360&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8475360&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1049095&attachment=8475360)

This patch saves the verified cert chain for each TransportSecurityInfo so it can be used later to see if pinning checks would pass for the host that is attempting to join. The unfortunate problem is that for session tickets, we don't have direct access to the previously-validated chain, so we have to add a hash table that keeps track of validated chains from hosts that could possibly initiate a session resumption. Then, we don't want that to grow unboundedly, so we have to cull it periodically (NSS appears to save tickets for 24 hours).

bsmedberg, this could have a performance impact in that it will in general require more memory. Also, I would appreciate a look at the usage of threads/timers. I realize you have a long review queue, so feel free to redirect this review.

This is a terrible name, it should be ChainPassesPinningChecks or similar. Also not sure why HostOrSuperdomainHasPins is not part of the check. That way the code is
if (pinningLevel != disabled && !ChainPassesPinningChecks) {

I dont see the need for HostOrSuperdomainHasPins. If verifiedCertChain->GetRawCertList() will return null then just call ChainHasValidPins with a non null empty CERTCertList.
That way we are guaranteed that we only implement the search logic once (a plus once we have dynamic pins)

Why not just finish the work I started for [bug 731478](/show_bug.cgi?id=731478 "NEW - Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in SSL session ID")? Then you would be able to use SSL\_PeerCertificateChain to get the cert chain the libssl fd in JoinConnection for resumed sessions too, without all this complexity.

Why not just call unconditionally call CertVerifier::VerifySSLServerCert here, perhaps in a new "local-only" (no OCSP fetching) mode? It seems like the root cause of this problem is that we tried to do a subset of the work that CertVerifier::VerifySSLServerCert is doing here, but we didn't keep this subset in sync with what CertVerifier::VerifySSLServerCert does. It seems likely that in the future, similar problems will come up as we extend the behavior of CertVerifier to do more kinds of checks.

I've built and tested the patch and, other than the assert mentioned below, we still join connections on google.com which is in the pin list. cool.
A chief concern here is the unbounded size of the cert chain cache in the resumed handshake info table (it is bounded by time, but not size). Do we have any sense of mean cert chain sizes and the distribution of how many people collect in 24 hrs?
I do think you can effectively bound it with an lru. Just store all the entries as lru-list with a hash index for quick lookups and when a new entry makes the list exceed a configured max size (variable by platform), drop the lru to make room. At time of use in joinConnection() if the cert chain can't be found, pessimistically don't join the connection. It would be nice to have data, but I bet you will have a high hit rate while knowing the max size. You can still walk the list periodically to toss out things over a day old.

Attached patch

[patch v2](attachment.cgi?id=8476050&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8476050&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1049095&attachment=8476050)

This patch is much better. I realized that as long as we're saving intermediates from successful connections, we'll be able to re-verify certificates from successful connections. (Unfortunately, this won't always work for private-browsing connections, since we don't save those intermediates.)

Just to confirm, in private browsing mode:
-- CertVerifier will not find the intermediate certs
-- So the verification will fail
-- So the connections will not coalesce (they'll just continue independently)
If that's correct, LGTM.

It is better to pass the flags the same way that they are passed to CertVerifier::VerifyCert, so that when you are reading the calling code, you see "FLAG\_LOCAL\_ONLY" instead of "true", which is much clearer.

You should generalize this comment, e.g. by saying "This ensures that any hostname-specific verification logic (e.g. key pinning) is satisfied by the joinee's end-entity certificate."
Please add this comment, and consider its implications:
"XXX(bug XXXXXXX): The certificate chain built by this verification may be different than the certificate chain originally built during the joined connection's TLS handshake. Consequently, we may report a wrong and/or misleading certificate chain for HTTP transactions coalesced onto this connection. This may become problematic in the future. For example, if/when we begin relying on intermediate certificates being stored in the securityInfo of a cached HTTPS response, that cached certificate chain may actually be the wrong chain. We should consider having JoinConnection return the certificate chain built here, so that the calling Necko code can associate the correct certificate chain with the HTTP transactions it is trying to join onto this connection."

David, whether or not we save certificates into the permanent database actually doesn't matter here. We are concerned about what CERT\_CreateSubjectCertList does. CERT\_CreateSubjectCertList looks for certificates in two places: (1) the permanent database, and (2) the set of (transient) CERTCertificate instances that have been created.
[Bug 731478](/show_bug.cgi?id=731478 "NEW - Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in SSL session ID") is relevant because, with that bug fixed, we are guaranteed to have a CERTCertificate instance for every cert in the chain, for both resumed and full handshakes. (Please verify this claim yourself.) This will be true whether or not we're in private browsing mode. (In fact, the fact that this is true in private browsing mode is actually a bug, because we're not supposed to be sharing things across connections like this in private browsing mode.)
In other words, your comment is misleading.

GetDefaultCertVerifier can return nullptr, and you should handle that.

We would be a little ways away from that..
the spdy and h2 tests use self signed certs and an override - and we never join onto connections with exceptions.
So we would need a xpcshell test that annotates the trust anchor list instead.. and a dns shim to give localhost 3 names.. and then at that point the back end can make assertions about the number of streams that use a particular connection in the same way the multiplexing tests already do.

Nope, we discussed this pretty thoroughly back when we were first adding the SPDY tests, and came to this same conclusion. We also came to the conclusion that that was \*way\* too much work, when we already had a hack for the certificate stuff.

I guess we could make the "don't join on exceptions" code preffable and have the test bypass that particular rule so it could test the other ones.

I don't think it would be too much work to set up those tests so that the certificate verifies without any exceptions/overrides. In fact, I did much (all?) of the work already in [bug 846581](/show_bug.cgi?id=846581 "RESOLVED FIXED - certificate override mechanisms for tests: use onreadystatechange, not nsIBadCertListener2").

oh that's great. I made [bug 1056987](/show_bug.cgi?id=1056987 "RESOLVED FIXED - h2 coalescing test") for a new test and had it block on 846581. A new test would have also had some serious dns pains, but we added a mechanism to specify by pref a whole bunch of aliases for localhost sometime between introducing coalescing and now.

Here's a patch for beta. The one issue is that if the user has disabled mozilla::pkix and is using classic verification, the LOCAL\_ONLY flag isn't respected (yay NSS). I thought the safe thing to do would be to pessimistically say all connections can't be joined in that case.

We're really late in beta and this being a sec-moderate I think we should consider whether we really need this in 32 or we can live with this until 33. This also hasn't hit m-c yet and according to [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049095#c35 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spdy/Http-2 Coalescing Key Pinning Bypass") has received minimal testing.
David - How badly do we need to take this in 32? If this had been discovered after beta9, would you argue for inclusion the RC? Would you argue that we chemspill for this issue?Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

The effect of not taking this for 32 is that users don't really get the benefit of twitter and amo being pinned until 33. So, it's not worse than the status quo. I wouldn't argue for a chemspill. If we had better automated test coverage, I might argue for inclusion in the RC, but as it is, I can't claim with great confidence that it will be more beneficial than harmful, particularly considering the performance impact of a user disabling mozilla::pkix.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

patch for beta
Given [comment 38](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049095#c38 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spdy/Http-2 Coalescing Key Pinning Bypass"), I'm going to deny this for beta. Let's wait until 33 for this change.

Marking this as needing verification so that I have it tracked.

Marking [qe-verify-] as creating the scenario that exercises this functionality would take us more time than we have allotted for bug verification. Also, the tests referenced on [comment 43](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049095#c43 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spdy/Http-2 Coalescing Key Pinning Bypass") have yet to be completed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Changes in mozilla-nspr:
- update to version 4.10.7
\* bmo#836658: VC11+ defaults to SSE2 builds by default.

PR\_NewThreadPrivateIndex.
\* bmo#1026129: Replace some manual declarations of MSVC intrinsics with
#include <intrin.h>.
\* bmo#1026469: Use AC\_CHECK\_LIB instead of MOZ\_CHECK\_PTHREADS. Skip
compiler checks when using MSVC, even when $CC is not literally "cl".
\* bmo#1034415: NSPR hardcodes the C compiler to cl on Windows.
\* bmo#1042408: Compilation fix for Android > API level 19.

Changes in mozilla-nss:
- update to 3.17.1 (bnc#897890)
\* Change library's signature algorithm default to SHA256
\* Add support for draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv

\* Part 1. Negotiate TLS 1.3
\* Part 2. Remove deprecated cipher suites andcompression.
\* Add support for little-endian powerpc64
- update to 3.17
\* required for Firefox 33 New functionality:
\* When using ECDHE, the TLS server code may be configured to generate a
fresh ephemeral ECDH key for each handshake, by setting the
SSL\_REUSE\_SERVER\_ECDHE\_KEY socket option to PR\_FALSE. The
SSL\_REUSE\_SERVER\_ECDHE\_KEY option defaults to PR\_TRUE, which means the
server's ephemeral ECDH key is reused for multiple handshakes. This
option does not affect the TLS client code, which always generates a
fresh ephemeral ECDH key for each handshake. New Macros
\* SSL\_REUSE\_SERVER\_ECDHE\_KEY Notable Changes:
\* The manual pages for the certutil and pp tools have been updated to
document the new parameters that had been added in NSS 3.16.2.
\* On Windows, the new build variable USE\_STATIC\_RTL can be used to
specify the static C runtime library should be used. By default the
dynamic C runtime library is used.

If a certificate's issuer can't be found, IsChainValid never gets called, which is where we do our pinning checks. As a result, a user can be presented with an overridable error on a site that should be pinned (i.e. we should display a pinning error and not allow an override).
STR:
1. run an https server with a self-signed cert
2. use /etc/hosts to redirect pinningtest.appspot.com to localhost
3. set pinning enforcement to "strict" (2)
4. visit <https://pinningtest.appspot.com>
expected results: pinning error page, not overridable
actual results: unknown issuer page, overridable

Does this mean we are now calling chainValidationCallback twice?

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: this makes it way too easy to bypass our key pinning implementation. Note that the target of an attack using this will still see an untrusted certificate warning, but they'll be able to click through and add an exception, which is definitely not what we want to happen for sites that have pins.

(In reply to [:mmc] Monica Chew (please use needinfo) from [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1066190#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - if an unknown issuer error is encountered before pinning checks are done, pinning checks never happen"))
> Does this mean we are now calling chainValidationCallback twice?
Thanks for the review. Here's my analysis on calling the chain validation callback multiple times: If we did call it and it succeeded, we won't run this code, so that's fine. If we did call it and it failed, either the pinning checks failed or something catastrophic happened. If the pinning checks failed, we won't run this code again and in any case we'll report the correct error. If something catastrophic happened, it may or may not happen again, but in either case we won't return an overridable error. Otherwise, we didn't already call the validation callback, so it would be safe to call it.

Given that we wontfix'd [bug 1049095](/show_bug.cgi?id=1049095 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spdy/Http-2 Coalescing Key Pinning Bypass") (another pinning bypass) for 32, I don't think it's essential that we take this for 32 either (furthermore, while the patch for this bug applies cleanly to 33-35, I don't think it'll apply as cleanly to 32 (it would be possible to make a branch-specific patch, but still)).Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

Thanks David. Based on [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1066190#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - if an unknown issuer error is encountered before pinning checks are done, pinning checks never happen"), I'm marking 32 as won't fix.

IMO, there is a better, simpler, way to fix this: Simply don't allow cert error overrides for any pinned domains. That is what you've effectively done, almost, since most users of HPKP won't be inning their end-entity certificate's key.

Reproduced the original issue using the following build:
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-09-09-03-02-07-mozilla-central/>
I followed the STR from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1066190#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - if an unknown issuer error is encountered before pinning checks are done, pinning checks never happen") and received the "This Connection is Untrusted" page which was overridable even though pinning enforcement was set to strict(2)
Went through verification using the following builds:
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-10-10-03-02-01-mozilla-central/> (changeset: 209717:50b689feab5f)
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2014-10-10-00-40-01-mozilla-aurora/> (changeset: 218224:72c13d8631ff)
- <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/candidates/33.0-candidates/build1/linux-x86_64/> (changeset: 218062:0e0dc4b23c13)
For each channel, I ensured that I received the following error message that was not overridable: (tested on normal/private and e10s windows)
"An error occurred during a connection to pinningtest.appspot.com. The server uses key pinning (HPKP) but no trusted certificate chain could be constructed that matches the pinset. Key pinning violations cannot be overridden. (Error code: mozilla\_pkix\_error\_key\_pinning\_failure)"Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

\* MFSA 2014-82/CVE-2014-1583 (bmo#1015540) Accessing cross-origin

\* When using ECDHE, the TLS server code may be configured to generate a
fresh ephemeral ECDH key for each handshake, by setting the
SSL\_REUSE\_SERVER\_ECDHE\_KEY socket option to PR\_FALSE. The
SSL\_REUSE\_SERVER\_ECDHE\_KEY option defaults to PR\_TRUE, which means the
server's ephemeral ECDH key is reused for multiple handshakes. This
option does not affect the TLS client code, which always generates a
fresh ephemeral ECDH key for each handshake. New Macros

\* bmo#1026129: Replace some manual declarations of MSVC intrinsics with
#include <intrin.h>.
\* bmo#1026469: Use AC\_CHECK\_LIB instead of MOZ\_CHECK\_PTHREADS. Skip
compiler checks when using MSVC, even when $CC is not literally "cl".
\* bmo#1034415: NSPR hardcodes the C compiler to cl on Windows.
