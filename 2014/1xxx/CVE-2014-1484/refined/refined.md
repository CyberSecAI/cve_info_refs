Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Firefox for Android logging the application's profile path to the Android system log (logcat).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The full profile path, including the application's data directory, is exposed in system logs.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** On Android versions 4.2 and earlier, other applications are able to read these system logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker could use the leaked profile path to gain access to the user's profile directory and the data contained within. This could expose sensitive information such as saved passwords, browsing history, and cookies.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** As noted in the bug report, the disclosed path was used in conjunction with another vulnerability to facilitate further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **System Log Access:** Malicious applications installed on the same device can read the system logs on Android 4.2 and earlier versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Application Installation:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the user's Android device.
*   **Android Version <= 4.2:** To exploit this, the device must run Android 4.2 or earlier, due to log access restrictions implemented in later versions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mozilla developers Roee Hay and Richard Newman.
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 27.
*   The bug report mentions that the vulnerability was also used in the exploit of bug #944374, related to a CrashReporter path traversal vulnerability, demonstrating how the disclosed path could be used in a chain of exploits.
*   The issue was considered a "moderate" severity security vulnerability by Mozilla.
*   The fix involved preventing the profile path from being logged.
