Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `mozilla::dom::OscillatorNodeEngine::ComputeCustom` function within the Web Audio API of Mozilla products. Specifically, the code wasn't correctly wrapping the phase index when looking up values in a table, leading to an out-of-bounds access when very high frequencies are used with custom waveforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an attempt to read data from memory locations beyond the allocated buffer for the custom waveform table. This occurs when the calculated phase index exceeds the table's boundaries.

*   **Improper Input Validation/Sanitization:** The vulnerability stems from the absence of proper checks to ensure that the calculated phase index remains within the valid range for the custom waveform table. There were no sufficient limits on the playback frequency when using custom waves, which exacerbated this issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** An out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to a crash due to accessing invalid memory locations. This can also lead to information leakage from memory.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the advisory notes that the out-of-bounds read could be potentially exploitable, which could allow for arbitrary code execution under the right conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Content:** The primary attack vector is through malicious web content. An attacker could craft a webpage that uses the Web Audio API with a custom waveform and a very high frequency, thus triggering the out-of-bounds read.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the user would need to visit or interact with the malicious web content in order for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to create a web page that leverages the Web Audio API in a way that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Ability to entice the victim:** The attacker must be able to get the victim to interact with the crafted web page. This could involve sending a link to a malicious website or embedding the malicious content on a compromised site.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by "Ash".
*   The fix involves using `fmod` to correctly wrap the phase index, though this was slower than an alternative that was originally tested.
*   The fix was applied to Firefox 29, 30 and 31, as well as several versions of B2G.
*   The issue is noted as a security vulnerability (`sec-high`) by the Mozilla Bugzilla team.
*   The vulnerability has been present since the custom waveform feature was added.
*   A performance issue was introduced due to the fix, and a separate bug was opened to address the performance concerns.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the alias CVE-2014-1522.
