  "date": "2014-03-11",
  "description": "When a programmer does not specify the action on the Spring form, Spring automatically populates the action field with the requested uri. An attacker can use this to inject malicious content into the form.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The Spring framework automatically populates the action field of a form with the requested URI when the programmer does not specify it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the form's action attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious content into the form, leading to potential execution of arbitrary code on the client side.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious URI that is used to populate the form's action attribute."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious URI that the vulnerable application will use to auto-populate the form's action attribute."
