Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1545:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write error within the `cvt_t()` function of the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) library. Specifically, this occurs during the use of `sprintf` and console functions when converting a double-precision floating-point number to its printable form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `sprintf` function, when used to convert a double to a string, could write past the buffer allocated for the output string, leading to memory corruption.
- **Improper use of `sprintf`**: The use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking allowed for the out-of-bounds write to occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: The out-of-bounds write could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**:  The out-of-bounds write could cause a crash leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be triggered by a remote attacker by crafting a malicious input to the console functions, causing the `sprintf` to write beyond the allocated buffer.
- For example, sending specially crafted format strings via `<script>console.warn("%301f", "1");</script>` or `<script>console.warn("%65416.123f", "a");</script>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to influence the input processed by NSPR's vulnerable function.
- This could involve delivering crafted content through web pages, emails or other means.
- The attacker must be able to craft input strings that exploit the insufficient bounds checking within the `sprintf` function.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue is present in NSPR library versions prior to 4.10.6.
- The vulnerability has been addressed by replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf` and implementing explicit null termination to prevent the overflow.
- The fix was included in NSPR version 4.10.6
- While the vulnerability exists in the NSPR library itself, it was exposed to web content through the console API introduced in Firefox 30.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by identifying the vulnerable function and the specific issue of missing bound checks in `sprintf`, including the attack vector examples.
