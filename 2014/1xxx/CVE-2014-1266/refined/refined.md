Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-1266:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a duplicated `goto fail;` statement within the `SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange` function in Apple's Secure Transport library. This unintentional duplication causes the code to unconditionally jump to the `fail:` label prematurely, bypassing crucial signature verification steps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Logic Error:** The duplicated `goto fail;` statement leads to incorrect program flow.
- **Missing Validation:** The premature jump to the `fail:` label skips the crucial signature verification of the ServerKeyExchange message, which is used in DHE and ECDHE ciphersuites.
- **Lack of Code Coverage:** The code after the second goto statement was never executed during testing and code coverage analysis did not detect this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker with a privileged network position can intercept and modify data in SSL/TLS sessions because the signature verification is skipped.
- **Decryption of Encrypted Traffic:** The vulnerability enables attackers to decrypt traffic even when Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is used, which is designed to protect against such attacks.
- **Spoofed Servers:** Attackers can impersonate a legitimate server by presenting a valid certificate chain while using a different private key for the handshake.
- **Bypass of Certificate Pinning**: Certificate pinning will not prevent this issue because the certificate chain is correct, and the handshake to the chain is broken.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Privileged Network Position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, typically achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Targeted Attack:** The vulnerability may be exploited in targeted attacks, where a specific individual or group is attacked. This can occur on public networks or with cooperation from ISPs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. This could be achieved through techniques such as ARP spoofing on a local network or through more sophisticated routing attacks, DNS spoofing, or gaining access to ISP infrastructure.
- **Ability to initiate the handshake:** The attacker can choose the ciphersuite, allowing them to pick a vulnerable path through the handshake
- **High-End Attacker**: If this was a deliberate backdoor, it was likely done by a high-end attacker, someone who wants to carry out MitM attacks and has the ability to sabotage the code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in iOS versions prior to 7.0.6 (confirmed on 7.0.4, also exists in some versions of iOS 6, fixed in 6.1.6), and in macOS versions prior to 10.9.2 (confirmed on 10.9.1).
*   The issue affects applications that use Apple's Secure Transport library, but not those using other SSL/TLS libraries such as NSS (used by Chrome and Firefox).
*   The vulnerability is triggered if Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is offered as an encryption option.
*   The duplicated line is not easily caught by code reviews, static analysis tools or compiler warnings.
*   A proper code review and code coverage testing should have caught the error.
