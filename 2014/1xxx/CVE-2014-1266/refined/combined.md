## [Goto Fail](../2014-02/2014-02-23.html)

23 February 2014
[![Printer-friendly rendering](../control/Printer-icon.png)](../2014-02/2014-02-23-print.html)

As you’ve probably heard by now, there’s a serious bug in the TLS
implementations in iOS (the iPhone and iPad operating system) and
MacOS. I’ll skip the details (but see Adam Langley’s
[excellent
blog post](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html) if you’re interested); the effect is that under certain
conditions, an attacker can sit in the middle of an encrypted connection
and read all of the traffic.

Here’s the code in question:
```

	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)
		goto fail;
	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)
		goto fail;
		goto fail;
	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)
		goto fail;
	…

```
Note the doubled
```

		goto fail;
		goto fail;

```
That’s incorrect and is at the root of the problem.

The mystery is how that extra line was inserted. Was it malicious or
was it an accident? If the latter, how could it possibly have happened?
Is there any conceivable way this could have happened? Well, yes.

Here’s a scan from a 1971 paperback printing of Roger Zelazny’s
[*Lord of Light*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_light).
> [![](../pictures/lordoflight.png)](../pictures/lordoflight.png)

Note the duplicated paragraph… Today, something like that could easily
happen via a cut-and-paste error.
(The error in that book was not authorial emphasis; I once checked a
hardcover copy that did not have the duplication.)

There’s another reason to think it was an accident: it’s not very subtle.
That sequence would stick out like a sore thumb to any programmer who
looked at it; there are *no* situations where two goto
statements in a row make any sense whatsoever. In fact, it’s a bit of
a surprise that the compiler didn’t flag it as an error; the ordinary process
of optimization should have noticed that the all of the
lines after second goto fail
could never be reached. The attempted sabotage of the
[Linux kernel](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/the-linux-backdoor-attempt-of-2003/)
in 2003 was much harder to spot; you’d need to notice the difference
between = and == in a context where any programmer
"just knows" it should be ==. However…

There are still a few suspicious items. Most notably, this bug is
triggered if and only if something called
"[perfect forward secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy)" (PFS)
has
been offered as an encryption option for the session. Omitting the
technical details of how it works,
PFS is a problem for attackers—including
government attackers—who have stolen or
[cryptanalyzed](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security)
a site’s private key. Without
PFS, knowing the private key allows encrypted traffic to be read; with PFS,
you can’t do that. This flaw would allow an attacker who was capable of
carrying out a "man-in-the-middle" (MitM)
attack to read even PFS-protected traffic.
While MitM attacks have been described in the academic literature at least
as long ago
[as 1995](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/security95/full_papers/joncheray.pdf),
they’re a lot less common than ordinary hacks and are more
detectable. In other words, if this was a deliberate back door, it was
probably done by a high-end attacker, someone who wants to carry out MitM
attacks *and* has the ability to sabotage Apple’s code base.

On the gripping hand, the error is noticeable by anyone poking at the file,
and it’s one of the pieces of source code that Apple publishes, which means
it’s not a great choice for covert action by the NSA or Unit 61398.
With luck, Apple will investigate this and announce what they’ve found.

There are two other interesting questions here: why this wasn’t caught during
testing,
and why the iOS fix was released before the MacOS fix.

The second one is easy: changes to MacOS require different "system tests".
That is, testing just that one function’s behavior in isolation
is straightforward: set up a test case and see what happens. It’s not
enough just to test the failure case, of course; you also have to test
all of the correct cases you can manage. Still, that’s simple enough.
The problem is "system test": making sure that all of the rest of the
system behaves properly with the new code in. MacOS has very different
applications than iOS does (to name just one, the mailer is very, very
different); testing on one says little about what will happen on the other.
For that matter, they have to create new tests on both platforms that
will detect this case, and make sure that old code bases don’t break on
the new test case. (Software developers use something called
"[regression testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing)"
to make sure that new changes don’t break old code.)
I’m not particularly surprised by the delay, though I suspect that Apple
was caught by surprise by how rapidly the fix was reverse-engineered.

The real question, though, is why they didn’t catch the bug in the first
place. It’s a truism in the business that testing can only show
the presence of bugs, not the absence.
No matter how much you test,
you can’t possibly test for all possible combinations of inputs
that can result to try to find a failure; it’s combinatorially
impossible. I’m sure
that Apple tested for this class of failure—talking to the wrong
host—but they couldn’t and didn’t test for this in every possible
variant of how the encryption takes place. The TLS protocol is exceedingly
complex, with many different possibilities for how the encryption is set up;
as noted, this particular flaw is only triggered if PFS is in use. There
are many other possible paths through the code. Should this particular
one have been tested more thoroughly? I suspect so, because it’s a
different way that a connection failure could occur; not having been on the
inside of Apple’s test team, though, I can’t say for sure how they decided.

There’s a more troubling part of the analysis, though. One very basic
item for testers is something called a "code coverage" tool: it shows
what parts of the system have or have not been executed during tests.
While coverage alone doesn’t suffice, it is a necessary condition; code
that hasn’t been executed at all during tests has never been tested.
In this case, the code after the second goto was never executed.
That could and should have been spotted. That is wasn’t does not speak
well of Apple’s test teams. (Note to outraged testers: yes, I’m
oversimplifying. There are things that are very hard to do in system
test, like handling some hardware error conditions.)
Of course, if you want to put on an extra-strength tinfoil hat, perhaps
the same attackers who inserted that line of code deleted the test for
the condition, but there is *zero* evidence for that.

So what’s the bottom line? There is a serious bug of unknown etiology in
iOS and MacOS. As of this writing, Apple has fixed one but not the other.
It may have been an accident; if it was enemy action, it was fairly clumsy.
We can hope that Apple will announce the results of its investigation and
review its test procedures.

## [Speculation About Goto Fail](../2014-02/2014-02-24.html)

24 February 2014
[![Printer-friendly rendering](../control/Printer-icon.png)](../2014-02/2014-02-24-print.html)

Following the logic in
[my previous post](../2014-02/2014-02-23.html), I don’t think that
Apple’s goto fail was a deliberate attack. Suppose it was,
though. What can we learn about the attacker?

The first point is that it very clearly was not the NSA or other
high-end intelligence agency. As I noted, this is too visible and
too clumsy. While they may not object to that, covertly tinkering
with Apple source code is a difficult and risky operation. If an
investigation by Apple shows that this was an attack, they’ll move heaven
and earth to close the hole, whether it was technical, personnel, or
procedural. In other words, using some covert access channel
to install a back door
effectively "spends" it; you may not get to reuse the channel. In that
case, they definitely would not use this one-shot on something that is
so easily spotted.
(What could they have done? There are lots of random numbers lying
around in cryptographic protocols; leak the session key—more likely,
a part of it—in one of those numbers. Use convoluted code to
generate this "random" number, complete with misleading comments.)

The next question is how this capability can be used.
The vulnerability requires a so-called "man-in-the-middle" (MitM) attack,
where an attacker has to receive all messages in each direction, decrypt
them, reencrypt them, and forward them to the proper destination.
If you’re intercepting a lot of traffic, that’s a lot of work.
There are a number of ways to do MitM attacks;
for technical
reasons, it’s a lot easier on the client or the server’s LAN, or with the
cooperation of either’s ISP. There are certainly other ways to do it,
such as DNS spoofing or routing attacks; that’s why we need
DNSSEC and BGPSEC. But ARP-spoofing from on-LAN is very, very easy.

We can narrow it down still further. If the main thing of interest
is email and in particular email passwords, the odds are that the
victim will be using one of the big "cloud" providers: Google, Yahoo,
or Microsoft. You *don’t* want to tap those nets near the servers;
apart from the technical difficulty (they’re good at running their
machines securely, and they don’t invite random strangers onto their nets),
and apart from the fact that you’d be trying to take a sip from a firehose,
it’s hard to figure out where to put the tap. Consider gmail. I checked
its IP address from my office, my house, and from a server I sometimes use
in Seattle. The IP addresses resolved to data centers near DC, New York City,
and Seattle, respectively. Which one should you use if you wanted my
traffic? Note in particular that though my office is in New York City
and my house is not, I got a New York server from when trying from home, but
not when trying from my office.

(There’s another possible attacker vector: software updates. Apple’s
updates are digitally signed, so they can’t be tampered with by
an attacker; however, that isn’t true for all third-party packages.
Tampering with an update is a way to get malicious code installed on someone’s
machine.)

The conclusion is simple: go after the client LAN. If it’s a LAN the
attacker and the target both have access to—say, an Internet
cafe or the like—the problem is very simple. In fact, if you’re
on-LAN with the target, you can home in on the target’s MAC address (which
doesn’t go off-LAN), making your life very simple. Alternatively, hack
into the wireless router or seek cooperation from the hotspot owner or the
ISP.
(Home routers are easily hacked, too, of course. If the attacker
goes that route, there’s no need for MAC-spoofing.)

We can also speculate that the victim is using an iOS device rather than
a Mac. If nothing else, Apple
[sells
far more](http://www.imore.com/apple-reports-q1-2014-results-iphones-ipads-macs-sold)
iPhones and iPads than it does Macs. There’s another reason to think
that, though: Macs are expensive, and Internet cafes are much more popular
in poorer countries where fewer people have broadband access at home.
Of course, if they’re using an iPhone in cellular mode, there’s no LAN
to camp on, but governments have little trouble gaining access to the
networks run by
their own telephone companies.
Either way, it sounds very much like a targeted attack, aimed at a very
few individuals.

My reasoning is, of course, highly speculative. If it was an attack, though,
I conclude (based on this tenuous set of deductions) that it was a moderately
capable government going after a small set of victims, either on a public
net or via the local mobile phone carrier. Most of us had nothing to worry
about—until, of course, the patch came out. And why a patch for
just iOS, with MacOS waiting until later? Apart from the system test
difficulties I mentioned last time, might it be because Apple was
warned—by *someone*!—that this hole was being exploited in the wild?
Again, I’m speculating…

---

**Update**: [Nicholas
Weaver](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/) notes that putting the exploit station on the victim’s LAN or
router solves another problem: identifying which machines may be
vulnerable to this exploit. It can look at other traffic from that MAC
address to decide if it’s an Apple product, what browser it’s using, etc.,
and not tip off the victim by pulling this stunt against Firefox or
Internet Explorer users.

In
[principle](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/fnat.pdf),
this can be done from off-LAN, but it’s harder, especially if
the hosts use
[strong sequence numbers](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1948.txt)
and randomize the IPid field. (Some open source operating systems do that.
I haven’t checked on Macs or Windows boxes in a long time.)

It is obvious and if you know c you'll see it(You don't need any knowledge of crypto). | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [alex1](user?id=alex1) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281671)   | [next](#7281581) [–]  Here's a diff of that file from OS X 10.8.5 (Security-55179.13) to 10.9 (Security-55471): <https://gist.github.com/alexyakoubian/9151610/revisions> Check line 631. Appears seemingly out of nowhere. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [gojomo](user?id=gojomo) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281789)   | [parent](#7281671) | [next](#7293840) [–]  Good find! But, are you sure the 10.8.5 (-55179.13) version isn't in some sense a later, patched maintenance branch compared to a 10.9 (-55471) that might have been frozen earlier? The release dates are very close (~2013-10-03 for 10.8.5; ~2013-10-22 for 10.9), and they might have already been separate branches. (Is there a 10.8.4 version to compare?) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [alex1](user?id=alex1) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281864)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7281789) | [next](#7293840) [–]  Good point. I just checked that file ever since it was open-sourced in 10.8 and it stays exactly the same throughout all of 10.8.x (10.8 - 10.8.5) and only changes in 10.9. (You can check for yourself here: <http://opensource.apple.com/>) It doesn't seem like what you said is the case here but obviously we're still missing changesets that may have been committed between 10.8.5 (Security-55179.13) and 10.9 (Security-55471). It'd be really interesting to do a git-blame on that file. EDIT: Nevermind, that file wasn't open-sourced in 10.8. It's actually really old. (Look for directories starting with libsecurity\_ssl in pre-10.8 OS X versions.) Didn't find anything particularly interesting in the old versions though. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gojomo](user?id=gojomo) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282013)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7281864) | [next](#7293840) [–]  Thanks for clarifying. I know silly errors like this can slip in, but I hope Apple does a deep x-ray on all circumstances surrounding the change. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [grkhetan](user?id=grkhetan) [on Feb 23, 2014](item?id=7284433)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7282013) | [next](#7293840) [–]  This bug of an extra duplicate line looks like a merge issue to me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cripto](user?id=cripto) [on Feb 24, 2014](item?id=7293840)   | [parent](#7281671) | [prev](#7281789) | [next](#7286030) [–]  So, what does that mean, the goto fail portion of the code. It seems like it will go to that no matter what. What is the end outcome? Thanks in advanced | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WaltSellers](user?id=WaltSellers) [on Feb 27, 2014](item?id=7310220)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7293840) | [next](#7286030) [–]  At that point the variable 'err' is still zero (noErr). So the function returns noErr, the caller thinks everything is good, and the communication is allowed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lectrick](user?id=lectrick) [on Feb 23, 2014](item?id=7286030)   | [parent](#7281671) | [prev](#7293840) | [next](#7281581) [–]  Goto considered harmful, indeed! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stigi](user?id=stigi) [on Feb 23, 2014](item?id=7286848)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7286030) | [next](#7313581) [–]  Not much a problem of `goto` per se. Rather a problem with if conditions used without code blocks. Others might say it's a problem of whitespace insensitive languages ;) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WaltSellers](user?id=WaltSellers) [on Feb 27, 2014](item?id=7310313)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7286848) | [next](#7289405) [–]  From a different point of view, part of the problem is the undefined state of the code at the "fail" label. Execution will arrive there somehow, but the 'how' is unclear. The word "fail" implies you should reach that point only if there was an error, but that is a bad assumption in this case. If the real answer to 'how did we get here?' was checked, then the bug could not hide in the undefined behavior. This would not allow a dangling goto to result in a false positive. A false negative will get someone's attention when their web page doesn't load. Something like this could remove the undefined state: ```       goto pass;   fail:     if ( err == 0 ) {     	assert( err != 0 ); // BUG! variable must contain an error number     	err = kSomeAppropriateErrorNumber;     }   pass:     SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);     SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);     return err; ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kplaxmaster](user?id=kplaxmaster) [on Feb 24, 2014](item?id=7289405)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7286848) | [prev](#7310313) | [next](#7310179) [–]  Haha love the whitespace comment. This also makes you think of the static source-code analysis done at Apple. Surely static tools would have picked this up, no...? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [subdigital](user?id=subdigital) [on Feb 24, 2014](item?id=7293230)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7289405) | [next](#7310179) [–]  Clang currently does not warn about this, but I'd wager that Xcode will boast a feature in the next version that detects dead code due to early returns/gotos. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [peternlewis](user?id=peternlewis) [on Feb 25, 2014](item?id=7294880)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7293230) | [next](#7310179) [–]  Clang may not warn about white space issues, but it certainly does warn about unreachable code if -Wunreachable is on. This code would not compile in my project because the unconditional goto leaves the following code unreachable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WaltSellers](user?id=WaltSellers) [on Feb 27, 2014](item?id=7310179)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7286848) | [prev](#7289405) | [next](#7313581) [–]  Even if there were braces, the bug would still exist if the extra goto was outside the braces. It might be more noticeable, but then, the original bug existed because no one noticed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dspeyer](user?id=dspeyer) [on Feb 27, 2014](item?id=7313581)   | [root](#7281671) | [parent](#7286030) | [prev](#7286848) | [next](#7281581) [–]   ```     return ERRCODE;  ``` Would have produced the exact same bug. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PhantomGremlin](user?id=PhantomGremlin) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281581)   | [prev](#7281671) | [next](#7281613) [–]  People bitch about indentation in Python. But in this case it would have prevented the bug! Of course Python doesn't even have a goto, so the code would have needed to be structured differently to start with. If I were a betting man I'd wager that this bug wasn't really an accident. It would be really interesting to check commit logs to see the history. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wreegab](user?id=wreegab) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282194)   | [parent](#7281581) | [next](#7288713) [–]  > People bitch about indentation in Python Really? I did something in Python for the first time a while ago and the indentation as code block is something I find very elegant. I can't fathom why would people find something wrong with this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [baq](user?id=baq) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282251)   | [root](#7281581) | [parent](#7282194) | [next](#7288713) [–]  it's relatively harder to refactor code - you can't just select between { and }. otherwise, no idea - python is my weapon of choice, so i may be biased. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rplnt](user?id=rplnt) [on March 1, 2014](item?id=7326551)   | [root](#7281581) | [parent](#7282251) | [next](#7288713) [–]  Can't really write onliners.

There's an old saying: "there are no coincidences on Wall Street". Not with the amounts of money that are involved. I think something similar should apply to critical security code. This reminds me of when someone tried to add the following to the Linux kernel: if ((options == (\_\_WCLONE|\_\_WALL)) && (current->uid = 0)) retval = -EINVAL; Oops, is that "uid == 0", or is that "uid = 0"? Yet another "typo" that couldn't happen in Python. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hahainternet](user?id=hahainternet) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281977)   | [parent](#7281613) | [next](#7281535) [–]  How could this not happen in Python? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PhantomGremlin](user?id=PhantomGremlin) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282004)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7281977) | [next](#7282743) [–]  Python does not allow an assignment to occur within an expression. They deliberately chose that restriction, to avoid that hard-to-see bug. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nuxi](user?id=nuxi) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7283711)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7282004) | [next](#7282816) [–]  True, but in languages with operator overloading you (may) end up with other issues. Unless you look at the source you have no idea what the '==' operator will do. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [staticfish](user?id=staticfish) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282816)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7282004) | [prev](#7283711) | [next](#7286058) [–]  I have always wondered why all languages don't enforce this? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cnvogel](user?id=cnvogel) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7283738)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7282816) | [next](#7283732) [–]  because, for example in C, such a incompatible change would alienate most developers used to the very ideomatic ```         if((val = function(args)) != expected)             return val; ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [joveian](user?id=joveian) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7283732)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7282816) | [prev](#7283738) | [next](#7286058) [–]  Because it is often really convenient, particularly with a simple macro preprocessor like cpp but in other circumstances too. I like gcc's approach of forcing you (if you have the right warning enabled) to put an extra pair of unnecessary parentheses around assignments in expressions. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lectrick](user?id=lectrick) [on Feb 23, 2014](item?id=7286058)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7282004) | [prev](#7282816) | [next](#7282743) [–]  A better solution is gcc's which forces you (if you enable the restriction) to put an extra pair of parens around inline assignments. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dspeyer](user?id=dspeyer) [on Feb 27, 2014](item?id=7313606)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7286058) | [next](#7282743) [–]  The parenthesis in this attack are sufficient to prevent that warning. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nickbauman](user?id=nickbauman) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282743)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7281977) | [prev](#7282004) | [next](#7281999) [–]  Good question, even though Python doesn't allow assignment in an expression, but for this reason I put the constant on the left side of the comparison no matter what language I use. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [manojlds](user?id=manojlds) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281999)   | [root](#7281613) | [parent](#7281977) | [prev](#7282743) | [next](#7281535) [–]  Because assigning in if would be a syntax error in Python. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mau](user?id=mau) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281535)   | [prev](#7281613) | [next](#7281802) [–]  Don't C compilers warn about code that is never executed? I'm actually pretty impressed how this bug was not caught before. The compiler warning is just one thing that came to my mind but test coverage should have been the strongest hint. A linter could have also make the thing easier for a code review. Probably these parts of the code should have stricter coding guideline. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acdha](user?id=acdha) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282196)   | [parent](#7281535) | [next](#7281574) [–]  > Don't C compilers warn about code that is never executed? Not by default. On both GCC and Clang this kind of error isn't caught using -Wall or even -Wextra - you have to explicitly opt-in using -Wunreachable-code. It'd really be nice if that changed and Clang basically had close to -Weverything on by default and required you to opt out, preferably with something like `#pragma ALLOW\_SHODDY\_<category>` per file to put some pressure on C programmers not to just continue ignoring errors rather than fixing them. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gsnedders](user?id=gsnedders) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282295)   | [root](#7281535) | [parent](#7282196) | [next](#7281574) [–]  In the latest GCC releases, -Wunreachable-code has been removed (the option still exists but is silently ignored for compat with existing Makefiles), as its output varied so much between releases (depending on what got optimized away). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acdha](user?id=acdha) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7282390)   | [root](#7281535) | [parent](#7282295) | [next](#7281574) [–]  I'd hope after this someone brings it back in some form – it's an incredibly useful tool and a diversity of implementations would be great for security-critical code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [d0](user?id=d0) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281574)   | [parent](#7281535) | [prev](#7282196) | [next](#7283771) [–]  You are 100% right. LLVM should fire a dead code warning here. However later code is used as a jump target for goto so it's quite hard for the compiler to infer this (or is it because its a different scope?). Either way, definitely avoidable. Looks typical of a merge cock up to me as the indentation is preserved suggesting it's a duplicate line or there was an if statement on the previous line that was removed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jey](user?id=jey) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7281731)   | [root](#7281535) | [parent](#7281574) | [next](#7283284) [–]  The basic blocks from just after the unconditional goto up to the "fail:" label are all unreachable, so a dead code warning could be issued. > However later code is used as a jump target for goto so it's quite hard for the compiler to infer this Nope, because a jump target always starts a new basic block. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fit2rule](user?id=fit2rule) [on Feb 22, 2014](item?id=7283284)   | [root](#7281535) | [parent](#7281574) | [prev](#7281731) | [next](#7283771) [–]  Looks to me like Apple aren't running Code-Coverage tests on their OS.

The better ones learn to just avoid if statements without blocks ;) But one thing that pisses me off is that they go and implement SSL and *don't have any automated tests for it*!! For a company of Apple's size, that can only be called grossly negligent. There is no excuse. And they probably don't have any automated testing for most of their other code either. What I would expect is that SSL code is tested with all the different of ways of spoofing a certificate. And that in an automated manner, on every build. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [juliok](user?id=juliok) [on Feb 26, 2014](item?id=7308971)   | [parent](#7288753) | [next](#7313572) [–]  My sentiments exactly. For them to have a piece of code that returns OK/notOK, in SSL of all things, and not have tests for both branches is inexcusable. Not only is this code untested, obviously, but the calling code (which should have two branches based on the result of this call) must be untested too.

I was doing this from an iPad, and iOS Safari is extremely bad at rendering source code (it's plain text, so it wraps it. It also chooses an incredibly large font size, so lines wrap at 50 characters or so in portrait mode. That made me bail out early, after reading this and not spotting the SRVR = SERVER abbreviation: ```     clientRandom.data = ctx->clientRandom;     clientRandom.length = SSL_CLIENT_SRVR_RAND_SIZE;     serverRandom.data = ctx->serverRandom;     serverRandom.length = SSL_CLIENT_SRVR_RAND_SIZE;  ``` That is something that I think static analysis tools could signal.

You don't need curly braces (surely you should always use them) or whitespace sensitivity or source code indentation beautification if you use the appropriate programming technique for this situation. Such endless error checking followed by releasing of resources at the end is a case for try / catch / finally.

They broke 2 of my (admittedly many) cardinal rules of C development: 1 - There is never ever a valid reason for using goto.

# [ImperialViolet](https://www.imperialviolet.org)

### [Apple's SSL/TLS bug](/2014/02/22/applebug.html) (22 Feb 2014)

Yesterday, Apple pushed a rather spooky [security update](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6147) for iOS that suggested that something was horribly wrong with SSL/TLS in iOS but gave no details. Since the answer is [at the top](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7281378) of the Hacker News thread, I guess the cat's out of the bag already and we're into the misinformation-quashing stage now.

So here's the Apple bug:

```
static OSStatus
SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa, SSLBuffer signedParams,
                                 uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)
{
	OSStatus        err;
	...

	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)
		goto fail;
	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)
		goto fail;
		goto fail;
	if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)
		goto fail;
	...

fail:
	SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);
	SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);
	return err;
}
```

(Quoted from [Apple's published source code](http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-55471/libsecurity_ssl/lib/sslKeyExchange.c).)

Note the two goto fail lines in a row. The first one is correctly bound to the if statement but the second, despite the indentation, isn't conditional at all. The code will always jump to the end from that second goto, err will contain a successful value because the SHA1 update operation was successful and so the signature verification will never fail.

This signature verification is checking the signature in a [ServerKeyExchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.3) message. This is used in DHE and ECDHE ciphersuites to communicate the ephemeral key for the connection. The server is saying “here's the ephemeral key and here's a signature, from my certificate, so you know that it's from me”. Now, if the link between the ephemeral key and the certificate chain is broken, then everything falls apart. It's possible to send a correct certificate chain to the client, but sign the handshake with the wrong private key, or not sign it at all! There's no proof that the server possesses the private key matching the public key in its certificate.

Since this is in SecureTransport, it affects iOS from some point prior to 7.0.6 (I confirmed on 7.0.4) and also OS X prior to 10.9.2 (confirmed on 10.9.1). It affects anything that uses SecureTransport, which is most software on those platforms although *not* Chrome and Firefox, which both use NSS for SSL/TLS. However, that doesn't mean very much if, say, the software update systems on your machine might be using SecureTransport.

I coded up a very quick test site at <https://www.imperialviolet.org:1266>. Note the port number (which is the CVE number), the normal site is running on port 443 and that *is* expected to work. On port 1266 the server is sending the same certificates but signing with a completely different key. If you can load an HTTPS site on port 1266 then you have this bug.

Because the certificate chain is correct and it's the link from the handshake to that chain which is broken, I don't believe any sort of certificate pinning would have stopped this. Also, this doesn't only affect sites using DHE or ECDHE ciphersuites - the attacker gets to choose the ciphersuite in this case and will choose the one that works for them.

Also, this doesn't affect TLS 1.2 because there's a different function for verifying the different ServerKeyExchange message in TLS 1.2. But, again, the attacker can choose any version that the client will accept. But if the client *only* enables TLS 1.2 then it appears that would workaround this issue. Likewise, if the client only enabled the plain, RSA ciphersuites then there's no ServerKeyExchange and that should also work around this issue. (Of the two, the former workaround is much more preferable.)

Based on my test site, both iOS 7.0.6 and OS X 10.9.2 fix the issue. (*Update*: it looks like the bug was introduced in 10.9 for OS X but existed in at least some versions of iOS 6. iOS [6.1.6](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6146) was released yesterday to fix it.)

This sort of subtle bug deep in the code is a nightmare. I believe that it's just a mistake and I feel very bad for whoever might have slipped in an editor and created it.

Here's a stripped down that code with the same issue:

```
extern int f();

int g() {
	int ret = 1;

	goto out;
	ret = f();

out:
	return ret;
}
```

If I compile with -Wall (enable all warnings), neither GCC 4.8.2 or Clang 3.3 from Xcode make a peep about the dead code. That's surprising to me. A better warning could have stopped this but perhaps the false positive rate is too high over real codebases? (Thanks to [Peter Nelson](https://twitter.com/_peterdn/status/437224206330523648) for pointing out the Clang does have -Wunreachable-code to warn about this, but it's not in -Wall.)

Maybe the coding style contributed to this by allowing ifs without braces, but one can have incorrect indentation with braces too, so that doesn't seem terribly convincing to me.

A test case could have caught this, but it's difficult because it's so deep into the handshake. One needs to write a completely separate TLS stack, with lots of options for sending invalid handshakes. In Chromium we have a patched version of [TLSLite](https://github.com/trevp/tlslite) to do this sort of thing but I cannot recall that we have a test case for exactly this. (Sounds like I know what my Monday morning involves if not.)

Code review can be effective against these sorts of bug. Not just auditing, but review of each change as it goes in. I've no idea what the code review culture is like at Apple but I strongly believe that my colleagues, Wan-Teh or Ryan Sleevi, would have caught it had I slipped up like this. Although not everyone can be blessed with folks like them.

Lastly, there was a lot of discussion yesterday that Apple missed checking the hostname in the certificate. It's true that curl on the OS X command line oddly accepts HTTPS connections to IP addresses when the IP address isn't in the certificate, but I can't find that there's anything more than that and Safari doesn't have that problem.

    Yes. 10.9.1 has this problem (not sure about earlier versions). 10.9.2, which is in beta, patches the problem. Should be released soon.

        10.7 probably isn't vulnerable, as it predates iOS 5 (which doesn't have this flaw).

        If 10.8 is vulnerable, the suggested upgrade would be 10.9.3 anyway. (10.9 has the same requirements as 10.8, and is a free upgrade.)

        I would like to see an article that explains which versions are vulnerable, however.

        I'm more curious if Apple will put out a fix BEFORE 10.9.2 ships; rumours still peg 10.9.2. a few weeks away.
