It occurs when both the main thread and the sipcc's CCApp task try to access the same 'cc_call_info_t_' data structure concurrently without proper thread safety mechanisms, leading to the structure being freed in one thread while still being accessed by another.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A use-after-free vulnerability due to lack of thread-safe access to shared data.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker could cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code via memory corruption by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering a specific sequence of operations in WebRTC signaling that lead to concurrent access and deallocation of the 'cc_call_info_t_' structure.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to manipulate WebRTC signaling in a way that causes the race condition."

The assembler fails to ensure that pointers are tenured, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Assertion failure due to usage of non-tenured pointer in a place that expects only tenured pointers.\n\nImpact of exploitation: While this specific case leads to an assertion failure, it highlights an underlying problem where the JavaScript JIT may incorrectly handle nursery pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering a specific sequence of JavaScript code and JIT operations, including use of asm.js, which exposed the vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to control JavaScript execution in the browser, potentially by crafting specific JavaScript code."

      "contents": "Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a double-pop of an SPS frame. If there is an overflow on the C stack during bailout from Ion to baseline, the system attempts to pop an SPS frame, but in some cases, the baseline-bailout code has already done the pop, causing a double pop. This can cause memory corruption by leading to an underflow of the SPS stack size, causing a pointer to be used which is completely off from the expected address.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Double pop on the stack, leading to use of an invalid stack size and incorrect address pointers.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Attackers could potentially cause out of bound reads/writes and arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption by manipulating the state of the stack.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering a specific sequence of operations including Ion to baseline bailouts in JS while using SPS profiling.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need the ability to control Javascript code execution and enable SPS profiling."

This happens due to an asynchronous nature of style rebuilding after changes to counter styles, leading to a use-after-free if the CounterStyle is removed and then referenced by old style data.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free condition resulting from inconsistent style updates and counter style object removals.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially trigger a crash or possibly corrupt memory if they can manipulate styles in a way that leads to accessing freed CounterStyle objects. This could allow arbitrary code execution if the object memory has been reused with a different object.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering a specific sequence of changes in CSS Counter styles, combined with dynamic removal of elements referring to those styles.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to control the loading and style definitions within a web page."

Specifically, the MGetElementCache and MGetPropertyCache with BarrierKind::TypeTagOnly do not properly check object types, and fail to use the TypeScript::Monitor. As a result, when a non-tenured object flows through such code path, it will cause an assertion failure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect usage of object type barriers that do not properly account for non-tenured object types in the JavaScript JIT.\n\nImpact of exploitation: If not caught via the assertion, a potential security issue exists because the code does not enforce type safety with the type tag only barrier, which can lead to type confusion and memory corruption if data is incorrectly accessed.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering the issue involves manipulating JS code in a way that causes it to use object property lookups or element reads that go through a code path containing the vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to control the javascript code execution."

The issue arises because the entry index is not re-looked up after operations that can trigger a garbage collection (GC). If the GC moves the object such that a new object allocation takes the original address of the cached object, accessing the cache will retrieve the wrong object.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect implementation of the object cache using non-updated object pointers after GC, causing a use-after-free condition.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Attackers could cause use-after-free situations by forcing memory to be used in unexpected places within garbage collection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nAttack vectors: This vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating javascript code to generate specific patterns of garbage collections with a subsequent object allocation at a previously cached address.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker can control javascript execution."

It arises from an oversight where these pointers are not being set and processed correctly during garbage collection and object relocation, which leads to a use-after-free.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The use-after-free vulnerability exists because the GC forwarding logic doesn't handle zero-length element arrays correctly.\n\nImpact of exploitation: It would be possible to access and manipulate memory that should be deallocated, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nAttack vectors: This vulnerability is triggered by crafting a javascript application with specific sequences of typed objects combined with GCs to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have control over Javascript code execution."
