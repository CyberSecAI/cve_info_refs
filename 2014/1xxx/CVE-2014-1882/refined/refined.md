Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-1882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that even if the framework's utility objects are not visible from an iframe, the main JavaScript objects implementing the bridge are available, and malicious code can access them directly. This is related to event-based bridges in Apache Cordova/PhoneGap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Direct Access to Bridge Objects:** Malicious scripts in iframes can directly access the core JavaScript bridge objects, bypassing intended security measures that restrict access to utility objects.
- **Vulnerable Event-Based Bridges:** The event-based bridges, despite attempts to enforce "NoBridge" properties, are exploitable due to the accessibility of the bridge objects.
- **Bypass of Same-Origin Policy:** The vulnerability allows malicious scripts from a different origin to interact directly with the bridge, effectively circumventing the same-origin policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Native Resource Access:** By gaining access to the bridge objects, malicious scripts can call native functions which can lead to unauthorized access to the device's functionalities and data.
- **Complete Application Control:** Malicious code can potentially take control of the application by exploiting the available native resource access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Iframe:** The primary attack vector is a malicious script loaded within an iframe inside a hybrid application. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application to load third-party content.
- **Direct Bridge Access:** The malicious script directly accesses the bridge objects to execute native code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious iframe or otherwise include malicious javascript in an iframe of the application. This might be through malicious ads, compromised content delivery networks or similar means.
- **JavaScript Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to understand how to use the JavaScript bridge to access native resources.
- **Target Application:** The target must be a hybrid application built with a vulnerable version of Apache Cordova/PhoneGap using event-based bridges.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is specific to event-based bridges within the Apache Cordova/PhoneGap framework.
- The vulnerability is related to the framework's failure to properly protect its internal objects when loaded within an iframe.
- The vulnerability is part of a set of issues discovered related to domain whitelisting and security flaws in the framework.
