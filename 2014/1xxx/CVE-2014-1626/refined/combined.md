Revision history for Perl extension MARC-XML

1.0.2 Tue Jan 21 17:18:37 UTC 2014
       - MARC::File::XML will now die upon parsing a record that
         declares an external entity and tries to use it. This
         prevents the potential unwanted disclosure of the contents
         of files on the server by applications that embed this module.
         If, for some reason, an application needs to process MARCXML
         records that contain external entities, set_parser() can be
         used to force the use of an XML::LibXML parser that is
         configured to process external entities.

         The issue was reported by John Lightsey.

1.0.1 Fri Feb 15 08:25:04 PST 2013
       - RT#83284: return empty MARC::Record given empty <record/>

1.0  Sun Feb 10 21:32:32 PST 2013
       - Use XML::LibXML rather than XML::SAX to parse MARCXML records.
         This offers a significant speed improvement for record parsing;
         in some tests, parsing time on a large file was reduced by 80%.
         This also avoids problems caused by character encoding bugs in
         XML::SAX::PurePerl.
       - Add method to let client code give MARC::File::XML a shared
         XML::LibXML parser object.

0.93 Fri Feb 11 17:13:02 EST 2011
       - When slurping MARCXML records (e.g., via MARC::Batch), can
         now handle XML files that use a prefix
         to refer to the http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim namespace.
       - If trying to parse a MARCXML record that has omitted
         the <record> wrapper element, throw an exception
         with a more meaningful error message.
       - adjusted copyright statement further to meet Debian requirements
         (RT#48333)
       - set license in Makefile.PL

0.92 Thu Jul 30 22:37:07 EDT 2009
      - small documentation changes to close RT tickets #48334 and #48333
        filed by Jonathan from Debian world.
      - added license string to META.yml so that CPAN can pick it up

0.91 Tue Jul 28 2009
      - Nixing the stray space (always been there) in the schemaLocation
        attribute for single-record output
      - Properly apply the leader modification for USMARC to signal UTF-8
        encoding.
      - Escape '<', '>', and '&' used as indicator values and subfield labels
        during XML output (Bill Erickson)
      - CPAN RT#34082: clarify names of header output switches

0.90 Fri Dec 14 2007
      - modifications to MARC::File::SAX to use LocalName rather than Name
        Name can contain a namespace prefix and cause parsing to fail
        Should be ok to rely on LocalName since the parser factory is
        requiring Namespace support?
      - MARC::File::SAX also can build up multiple records now, for use
        in other SAX contexts like Net::OAI::Harvester. This required
        a few changes in MARC::File::XML as well.

0.88 Wed Nov 28 2007
      - String test for subfield code to avoid dropping $0 (Galen Charlton)

0.88_1 Tue Oct 23 2007
      - Fixed a typo in M::F::X that could be the origin of the test failure(miker)
      - Removed some useless (and confusing) code that
	    throws away some character set mapping information in the 066 (miker)

0.85 Fri Feb 13 2007
      - fixed typo in handling of unimarc w/regard to marc8 (ppoulain)

0.84 Mon Nov 26 2006
      - Fixed UNIMARC encoding detection logic (miker)
	  - Added UNIMARC Authority support (miker)

0.83 Fri Apr 21 15:19:20 EST 2006
      - remove premature return from close() thanks Jay Luker (exlibris)

0.82 March 4, 2006
      - details unknown :(

0.81  Fri Feb  3 23:29:04 EST 2006
      - minor changes so that diagnostics (when character mappings aren't found)
        will not throw warnings about unitialized variables too.

0.8   Fri Feb  3 22:49:11 EST 2006
      - overhaul by Mike Rylander to use the new MARC::Charset for mapping
        back and forth from marc8 encoding to utf8 encoding
      - Makefile.PL requires v0.9 of MARC::Charset to be installed

0.7   Thu Apr 14 11:54:24 CDT 2005
      - marc2xml uses MARC::Batch in lenient mode, thanks Rob Casson.

0.66  Thu Sep 23 01:12:20 CDT 2004
      - added ability to change the encoding attribute.

        to is_control_field().

0.6   Sat May 08 02:23:04 2004
      - rudimentary XML encoding (thanks to Peter Robertson for inquiring
        about it)

0.53  Mon Dec 01 17:32:01 2003
      - fixed to still process XML that has namespaces on record element
        thanks Clay Redding at princeton.edu.

0.52  Wed Oct 29 20:18:44 2003
      - fixed doc bug

0.51  Thu Sep 04 10:33:12 2003
      - fixed warnings in MARC::File::SAX which were emitted under new
        Test::Harness.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SECURITY release: MARC::File::XML 1.0.2

Hi,

I have uploaded [1] version 1.0.2 of MARC::File::XML.  This is a
security release that repairs an XML external entity (XXE)
vulnerability.  I recommend that all uses of MARC::File::XML upgrade
promptly.

Here is the change log entry:

1.0.2 Tue Jan 21 17:18:37 UTC 2014
       - MARC::File::XML will now die upon parsing a record that
         declares an external entity and tries to use it. This
         prevents the potential unwanted disclosure of the contents
         of files on the server by applications that embed this module.
         If, for some reason, an application needs to process MARCXML
         records that contain external entities, set_parser() can be
         used to force the use of an XML::LibXML parser that is
         configured to process external entities.

         The issue was reported by John Lightsey.

Hi,

I have uploaded [1] version 1.0.2 of MARC::File::XML, a Perl module
which is used by Koha. This is a security release that repairs an XML
external entity (XXE) vulnerability.  I know of at least one way that
the vulnerability could be used by an individual who has staff
interface credentials to view the contents of arbitrary files on the
Koha server.

Consequently, I recommend that Koha users arrange to upgrade
MARC::File::XML promptly.  On many Linux systems, this can be done by
running the following command with root privileges:

cpan MARC::File::XML

If the installation fails, the most likely reason is that your version
of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not recent enough.  You can fix this by
running the following command first, then attempting the installation
of MARC::File::XML again.

cpan ExtUtils::MakeMaker

Please note that at the time of this writing, not all CPAN mirrors
will have the most recent version of MARC::File::XML.

You can check the version of MARC::File::XML that is installed by running:

perl -MMARC::File::XML -e 'print $MARC::File::XML::VERSION, "\n"'

I imagine that an updated Debian package of libmarc-xml-perl will be
made available on debian.koha-community.org at some point as well.
For any users of Koha on Fedora that are out there, Dan Scott will be
packaging MARC::File::XML 1.0.2 shortly.

Please note that older releases of MARC::File::XML prior to the switch
to XML::LibXML are also vulnerable.

Here is the relevant change log entry:

1.0.2 Tue Jan 21 17:18:37 UTC 2014
       - MARC::File::XML will now die upon parsing a record that
         declares an external entity and tries to use it. This
         prevents the potential unwanted disclosure of the contents
         of files on the server by applications that embed this module.
         If, for some reason, an application needs to process MARCXML
         records that contain external entities, set_parser() can be
         used to force the use of an XML::LibXML parser that is
         configured to process external entities.

         The issue was reported by John Lightsey.
