The provided content is related to a commit that addresses Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), and provides some detail on the changes made.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), where an attacker can initiate a WebSocket connection from a different origin, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application's WebSocket functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The server did not properly validate the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake, which could lead to CSWSH.
- Absence of proper CSRF token verification for websocket connections.
- Missing session validation during websocket handshake.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- If successfully exploited, a malicious actor could perform unauthorized actions using the victim's active session by connecting to a websocket endpoint. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized control, or other malicious activities, since the attacker would be able to bypass access control mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker could create a malicious webpage on a different origin that attempts to open a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application, bypassing the Same-Origin Policy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage (or otherwise send a websocket request) from a domain different from the vulnerable application. They also need to know the websocket endpoint and application protocol to exploit.

**Changes introduced in the commit:**

- The commit implements validation of the `Origin` header in the WebSocket upgrade request. It now checks if the scheme, host, and port of the `Origin` header match the server's URI.
- CSRF tokens are now required for authenticated websockets. The CSRF token must be present as a URL parameter `_csrf` and match the user's CSRF token.
- User authentication is checked, and unauthenticated users are blocked from connecting to authenticated websocket endpoints.
- The `Cookie` class has been updated to force cookies to only be delivered over SSL when SSL is enabled, preventing cookie hijacking over public wifi networks.
- The `User` class now creates a new random CSRF token every time the user logs in.
