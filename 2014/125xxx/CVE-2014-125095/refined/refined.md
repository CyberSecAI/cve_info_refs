The provided content is a commit diff for the WordPress plugin "contact-form-plugin". The commit message indicates a "Security Exploit was fixed".  The diff shows multiple file changes, but the most relevant changes are in `bws_menu/bws_menu.php` and `contact_form.php`.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability appears to stem from insufficient input sanitization in the email functionality of the plugin. Specifically the plugin uses regular expressions to validate email addresses which can be bypassed in various ways.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insecure Email Validation:** The code was using a flawed regular expression `"/^((?:[a-z0-9_']+(?:[a-z0-9\-\_\.']+)?@[a-z0-9]+(?:[a-z0-9\-\.]+)?\.[a-z]{2,5})[, ]*)+$/i"` to validate email addresses in `bws_menu/bws_menu.php` (for sending system info) and `contact_form.php` (for form submissions). This regex based validation could be bypassed.
    *   **Missing input sanitization**:  The code also uses `stripslashes` and `esc_html` on the email addresses *after* the regex check in `bws_menu/bws_menu.php` and `contact_form.php`, which does not prevent the injection.

*   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious code into the email fields, potentially leading to:
    *   **Email Header Injection:** If the email is not properly sanitized and processed, an attacker could inject additional headers into the email, which could be used for spamming or phishing.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the email is not properly sanitized and processed and sent using a vulnerable mailer, an attacker could execute code on the server.
    *   **Data exfiltration:** If the email is not properly sanitized, and the server is configured to store email data, an attacker can exfiltrate internal data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Contact Form:** By providing a specially crafted input to the email fields in the contact form.
    *   **System Info Form:** By providing a specially crafted input to the email field in the system info form which is present in the plugin's admin menu.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to fill the contact form or access the settings page of the plugin.

**Changes in the Commit:**

The commit addresses the vulnerability by:

*   **Improved Email Validation:** Replaces the flawed regex validation with `is_email()` function in `bws_menu/bws_menu.php` and `contact_form.php`.
*   **Sanitization**: Removed the `stripslashes` calls before the sanitization function in `contact_form.php`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit also includes various other changes, such as updates to language files, minor code refactoring, and banner updates, which do not directly relate to the security vulnerability.
*   The commit message "Security Exploit was fixed" confirms that the primary intent of the changes was to address a security issue.

**Summary**

The commit fixes an email header injection vulnerability due to insecure email validation and improper input sanitization. The main vulnerability was the usage of regular expressions for email validation which allowed attackers to inject malicious content through form fields that take email addresses as input, allowing them to potentially send spam, perform phishing attacks, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
