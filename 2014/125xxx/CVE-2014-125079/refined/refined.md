Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2014-125079:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided content includes a commit message that says "Fixed SQL Injection Hole". This commit modifies the `lib/Http.coffee` file. It appears the vulnerability was a SQL injection vulnerability. 

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the `path` variable within the URL string was not properly sanitized. The code was using string interpolation to construct the URL string:
```coffee
url: "http://auth.wot.io/authenticate_token/#{token}/#{command}/#{path}"
```
This could be vulnerable to SQL injection if the `path` variable contains single quotes (`'`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection. The `path` variable could contain malicious SQL code disguised as a path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query sent to the database, possibly allowing them to read, modify, or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Path:** An attacker could craft a malicious path string containing SQL injection payloads, e.g. `path` could contain `' OR 1=1 --`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` variable, which is used in the URL string.

**Technical Details from the Commit:**

The commit message and the diff from the file `lib/Http.coffee` provide additional details. The code change replaces any single quotes with double quotes:
```coffee
url: "http://auth.wot.io/authenticate_token/#{token}/#{command}/#{path}".replace("'", "''")
```
This was the fix implemented for the SQL injection vulnerability. This is not a proper fix for preventing SQL injection, but rather a workaround to avoid the injection, since the root of the problem was not using parametrized queries to construct the URL string.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in `agy/pontifex.http` and the commit to fix it.  The vulnerability was present because the `path` variable was not properly sanitized when constructing a URL, which allowed for the injection of SQL commands. The fix was a workaround of replacing single quotes with double quotes, instead of using parameterized queries. This would prevent basic injection by escaping the single quotes, but not prevent advanced injection attacks.
