{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in `pb_dec_string` and `pb_dec_bytes` functions when decoding messages with string or bytes fields.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow in size calculation for string fields, leading to heap overflow.",
    "Integer overflow in size calculation for bytes fields, leading to heap overflow.",
    "Potential null byte write before string field.",
    "Potential uncontrolled memory writes on 64-bit systems",
    "Potential heap corruption or remote code execution due to writing past a 0-byte malloc buffer."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, remote code execution, heap corruption, or data corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Passing untrusted data to `pb_decode()`.",
    "Crafted protocol buffer messages with large string or bytes fields.",
    "Custom `pb_istream_t` implementations with large `bytes_left` values."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to control the input data stream to the nanopb decoder."
