The provided content is a commit message from a WordPress plugin repository. The commit message states "Security Exploit was fixed", which suggests a vulnerability was addressed. However, without the CVE description, it's impossible to definitively confirm whether this commit corresponds to CVE-2014-125109.

The commit message also mentions "Bug with localization was fixed."

The commit diff shows changes to the following files:
- `bws_menu/bws_menu.php`: This file contains code for displaying a BestWebSoft menu. Changes include updates to plugin descriptions, URLs, and an important change in the email validation logic. The code now uses `is_email()` for validation instead of a regex that allowed multiple comma-separated emails.
- `bws_menu/css/style.css`: Minor change related to CSS styling.
- `bws_menu/icons/*.png`: New plugin icons.
- `portfolio.php`: No information provided.
- `readme.txt`: No information provided.

Based solely on the commit message and the code diff for `bws_menu/bws_menu.php` we can infer a possible vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The original email validation logic was flawed, allowing multiple comma-separated values, likely intending to allow for multiple emails to be submitted for sending the system info. However, it appears that this is not the intended functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The previous regex based email validation was inadequate and allowed multiple comma separated email addresses. This could have been exploited to potentially send emails to unintended recipients, or could have been misused in other contexts.
- **Lack of proper email validation:** The validation was weak, not using proper built in email validation function `is_email()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential for spamming or information disclosure:** An attacker might have been able to manipulate the email sending functionality to send emails to multiple addresses, potentially leading to spamming, or other unintended consequences. If system information is included, an attacker could gather system info, by injecting his email address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious input in the email field:** An attacker could exploit the flawed email validation by submitting multiple comma separated email addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to access the form that triggers the email functionality in the WordPress admin panel and have the ability to inject input into the email field. This requires administrative access to the WordPress site.

**Note:** While this analysis suggests a possible vulnerability fixed in this commit, without the CVE description it is not possible to determine if this relates to CVE-2014-125109, or if other vulnerabilities were fixed in this commit.
