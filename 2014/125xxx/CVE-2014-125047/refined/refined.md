The provided content is related to CVE-2014-125047.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit message "Changed all of the SQL Queries to be safe from SQL Injeection" clearly indicates that the vulnerability is related to SQL injection. The code diffs show changes from using string concatenation to build SQL queries to using `PreparedStatement`, which prevents SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code was vulnerable to SQL injection. By manipulating user input (e.g., in `month`, `day`, `year` parameters in URLs), an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. In some cases, it could also be used for privilege escalation or to gain access to the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests where parameters like month, day and year are vulnerable. These parameters are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the application and manipulate the parameters that are used in SQL queries.

The provided commit diffs demonstrate how the application was vulnerable, and how the vulnerability was fixed:
   - Code diffs in files like `src/com/bezman/background/DailySubmission.java`, `src/com/bezman/servlet/Attendance.java`, `src/com/bezman/servlet/DailyServlet.java`, `src/com/bezman/servlet/IndexServlet.java`, `src/com/bezman/servlet/ItemRecapServlet.java`, `src/com/bezman/servlet/ItemSettings.java` show changes from using `IndexServlet.execQuery("select * from ... " + userInput + " ...")` to using prepared statements `PreparedStatement statement = IndexServlet.connection.prepareStatement("select * from ... ? ...")` and setting the user input as parameters with functions like `statement.setString(1, userInput)`
