The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository. The commit message "Sanitized form input to protect against SQL injection" and the changes in the `image_controller.rb` and `show.html.erb` files suggest this commit is related to mitigating a SQL injection vulnerability and cross-site scripting (XSS) respectively.

Specifically:

- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The original code in `image_controller.rb` directly used the `params[:sol]` value in a database query without sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The `show.html.erb` was also vulnerable to XSS via `params[:sol]`
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    - **SQL Injection**: Unsanitized input from `params[:sol]` being used in a SQL query.
    - **XSS**:  Unsanitized input from `params[:sol]` being displayed on the page.
- **Impact of Exploitation**:
    - **SQL Injection**:  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
    - **XSS**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially stealing user credentials or performing other malicious actions on the user's browser.
- **Attack Vectors**:
    - **SQL Injection**:  Manipulating the `sol` parameter in the URL to include SQL injection payloads.
    - **XSS**:  Manipulating the `sol` parameter in the URL to include HTML/javascript payloads.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    -  An attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and manipulate the `sol` URL parameter, which means they would need to have access to the web application.

The code diff shows that the SQL injection was addressed by changing `Image.where(sol: params[:sol])` to `Image.where(:sol => params[:sol])`. While this does fix the specific vulnerability in the provided context, it is not the best approach. The best way would be to use parameterized queries, this change still uses string interpolation and would be vulnerable to injection in some cases if the database driver is not sanitizing input, or if a different database is used with an incompatible database driver. The XSS was addressed by using the helper `h` on `params[:sol]`  `<%=h params[:sol] %>`
