The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a "session fixation" vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code, specifically in the `oauth.js` controller, was not properly regenerating the session after a successful XING login. This left the session ID vulnerable to fixation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session fixation: The session was not regenerated after successful authentication via XING OAuth, making it possible for an attacker to force a user to use a known session ID.
- The code uses `res.cookie('requestToken', null)` to delete cookie, but this operation is performed before session regeneration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by pre-setting a session ID. If a user then logs in, the attacker would gain access to the user's account.
- Could lead to unauthorized access to user data and functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could trick a user into visiting the vulnerable application and use a pre-determined session ID.
- Successful exploitation depends on the user authenticating through XING OAuth.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the session ID before the user authenticates with the XING OAuth flow. This could be achieved through social engineering or other means of influencing the user's browser state.
