```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way `SandboxedStrings` were handled, allowing sandboxed code to manipulate these strings and bypass intended protections. This also includes errors when casting `SandboxedStrings` to integers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Manipulation of `SandboxedStrings` by sandboxed code, leading to bypassed security restrictions.
    - Errors when casting `SandboxedStrings` to integers which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow sandboxed code to potentially break out of the sandbox environment or cause unintended consequences due to type-checking errors.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious code within the sandbox environment that manipulates `SandboxedStrings`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute code within the PHP sandbox.
