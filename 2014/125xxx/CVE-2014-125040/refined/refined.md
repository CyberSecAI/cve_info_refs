Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified CVE:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The commit message "Fix SQL injection vulnerability" and the code changes shown in the diff confirm that this content is related to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the direct embedding of user-provided input (`$name`) into an SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The original code used string concatenation to build the SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection if the `$name` variable contains malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to:
    *   Bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms
    *   Read sensitive data stored in the database
    *   Modify data within the database
    *   Possibly execute arbitrary commands depending on the database system and privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `$name` parameter passed to the `getByName` function with malicious SQL code.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the value of the `$name` parameter, which is likely an input field from an application that uses this code.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was located in `php/data_access/RemoteHtmlContentDataAccess.php`.
*   The vulnerable function was `getByName`, specifically the line `return self::getForQueryString("SELECT * FROM \"DevNewsAggregatorConfiguration_htmlcontent\" WHERE name = $name");`.
*   The fix involves using parameterized queries (prepared statements) via the line `return self::getForQueryString("SELECT * FROM \"DevNewsAggregatorConfiguration_htmlcontent\" WHERE name = $1", array($name));`. By using `$1` as a placeholder and passing `$name` as a parameter, the SQL engine properly escapes the value, thus preventing SQL injection.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**
- **Root cause:** Direct embedding of user-provided input into an SQL query string.
- **Weakness:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potentially arbitrary command execution.
- **Attack vector:** Malicious input in `$name` parameter.
- **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to manipulate the value of the $name parameter.
