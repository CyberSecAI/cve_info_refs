The provided content relates to CVE-2014-125104.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a remote file upload vulnerability in the MailPoet (wysija-newsletters) plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability exists in versions of the MailPoet plugin prior to 2.6.7.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper access controls or capability checks within the MailPoet plugin when handling file uploads. This allows unauthorized users to upload files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary files to the server. This could lead to various malicious activities including:
*   Executing arbitrary code on the server.
*   Defacing the website.
*   Gaining access to sensitive data.
*   Compromising the server and using it as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request to the WordPress site running the vulnerable MailPoet plugin. This could be done via AJAX requests or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site. Specifically, they would need to send a specially crafted request to upload a file via the vulnerable MailPoet plugin. The attacker does not need to have a valid account on the WordPress site, given the vulnerability is related to the lack of access control.

**Additional notes:**
The commit `e3b92b14edca6291c5f998d54c90cbe98a1fb0e3` introduces a hotfix in VaultPress plugin to protect against the MailPoet plugin vulnerability. This hotfix is implemented by adding a capability verification check in the `protect_wysija_newsletters_verify_capability` function to restrict access to MailPoet functionalities only for users with the appropriate privileges when the MailPoet plugin version is less than 2.6.7.
