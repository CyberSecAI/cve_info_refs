{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is using string interpolation to construct a SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could manipulate the SQL query to potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to inject malicious SQL code into the 'last_name' input field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's input fields."
