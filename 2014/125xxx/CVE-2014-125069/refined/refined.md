Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a directory traversal vulnerability by ensuring that when a directory is requested, the server returns `index.html` instead of exposing directory contents. The relevant changes are in `http-server.js`.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The original code allowed directory listing, which could expose sensitive information or internal file structures. This is a classic directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** Without proper handling, requesting a directory would expose the files within that directory to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to the file structure and potentially sensitive information not intended for public access by requesting directories.

**Attack vectors:**

- Attacker could request a directory instead of a specific file from the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker only needs to send HTTP requests to the server. No special privileges or network access is required other than being able to communicate with the server.

**Mitigation:**
- The patch returns `index.html` when a directory is requested.
