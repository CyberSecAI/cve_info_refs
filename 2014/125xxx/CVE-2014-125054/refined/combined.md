Solved duplicate votes issue; Discovered karma exploitation

Exploit - Currently even if you already upvoted you can click the upvote button again, which doesn't add a new vote to the post/comment but *does* add more to the user's karma since there's no check for existing vote value to only add karma for actual changes to votes
