The provided content describes a vulnerability in a Reddit-like Rails application where users can repeatedly upvote posts and comments to gain karma.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly check for existing votes before awarding karma. This allows users to repeatedly click the upvote button and receive karma for each click, even if they have already voted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper vote handling allows duplicate votes.
- Lack of check to prevent multiple karma awards for the same vote action.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users can manipulate the karma system and artificially inflate their karma score.

**Attack vectors:**
- Users can repeatedly click the upvote button on posts and comments to increase their karma.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the voting mechanism (e.g. upvote button)
