The provided content is related to CVE-2014-125050.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries, which is susceptible to SQL injection. This occurs when user-supplied input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code uses string concatenation to construct SQL queries. The vulnerability exists in multiple places where user-supplied parameters are directly inserted into the SQL queries without using parameterized queries or prepared statements. This is evident in the `main.js` file, where queries are built using template literals or string concatenation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters. This could allow the attacker to:
- Access or modify sensitive data stored in the database.
- Bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Execute arbitrary database commands.
- Potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests containing malicious input in URL parameters (e.g., id) or form data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with the ability to modify the parameters and the body of the request. No specific privileges are needed, access to the exposed endpoints is sufficient for exploitation.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by using parameterized queries with placeholders (`?`) and passing the user-supplied data as parameters to the database query. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL command, preventing SQL injection. The vulnerable code was replaced with the parameterized approach in many parts of the file.
