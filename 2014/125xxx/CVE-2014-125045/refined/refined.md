The provided content relates to a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability, as indicated by the commit message "Opdracht 4 | Fixed SQL injection 3x".

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The original code directly included user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. The code used string concatenation to build the `WHERE` clause in the SQL query based on user-provided input `$where`:
    ```php
    $whereCondition = 'WHERE ' . (is_numeric($where) ? 'id=\''.$where.'\'' : 'naam=\''.$where.'\'');
    ```
    This made it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `$where` variable. The code checks if the input is numeric to decide whether the search is based on `id` or `name` but this does not prevent SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in the SQL query.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially:
    *   Access sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the server in extreme cases (although less likely in this scenario).

*   **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through the `$where` parameter of the `GetAnimal` function. By crafting a malicious string in this parameter, an attacker could inject SQL code.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input provided to the `$where` parameter of the `GetAnimal` function. This likely involves user interaction with a web form or URL parameter.

The commit addresses the vulnerability by:
1.  **Using prepared statements with bind parameters**: The code now uses PDO's prepared statements and bind parameters, which is the proper way to avoid SQL injection. The following code replaces the previous, vulnerable version:
```php
$whereCondition = 'WHERE ' . (is_numeric($where) ? 'id=UNHEX(:where)' : 'naam=UNHEX(:where)');
```
    This defines the parameterized query using the `:where` placeholder which is later bound with `bindParam`.
2.  **Hex encoding the input**: The provided user input is first converted to its hexadecimal representation using `bin2hex()` before binding it to the `:where` parameter. This helps to prevent SQL injection attacks where special characters might cause issues.

In summary, the commit shows the transition from a vulnerable SQL query building method to a secure prepared statement method.
