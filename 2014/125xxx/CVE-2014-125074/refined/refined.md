The provided content is related to CVE-2014-125074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of string concatenation to build SQL queries in the `DatabaseAccess.java` file, instead of using parameterized queries. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `DatabaseAccess.java`

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
- Bypass authentication.
- Read or modify sensitive data.
- Execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- Potentially gain complete control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating input fields (such as username, password or post title) in the web application to insert malicious SQL code within database queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and its input forms and have network access to the application server.
