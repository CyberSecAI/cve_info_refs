### @bgw **[bgw](/bgw)** commented [Dec 3, 2014](#issue-50750910)

I've got a slow-ass laptop, so deploying to digitalocean is faster, and cheap enough that I don't care.

This sets some default passwords, which makes the box vulnerable, but the machine is short-lived and has no sensitive information so it shouldn't matter. Long-term, this should be fixed somehow.

Sorry, something went wrong.

|  |  | =========== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Disables ssh `root` login. This improves security, but may get in the way if you |
|  |  | aren't using a `deploy` user. |

|  |  | like disabling password auth. |
