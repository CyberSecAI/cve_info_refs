Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3829

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of the `session_id` and `template_id` variables in the `displayServiceStatus.php` file, combined with insufficient filtering of the `command_line` variable. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.
- Specifically, the `escape_command` function is inadequate, as it doesn't properly sanitize characters like semicolons (`;`), which are crucial for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands due to the lack of proper input sanitization and escaping.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `displayServiceStatus.php` script does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests.
- **Inadequate Command Escaping:** The `escape_command` function fails to prevent command injection by not filtering out all special characters, specifically the semicolon.
- **SQL Injection (Indirect Association):** While CVE-2014-3829 is specifically about command injection, the provided information also mentions multiple unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-3828) that are exploitable in other Centreon components that might interact with the vulnerable `displayServiceStatus.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Centreon application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The command injection vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `displayServiceStatus.php` script. The attacker manipulates the `session_id` and `template_id` parameters to inject malicious commands into the underlying operating system.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack does not require any prior authentication, making it highly dangerous.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Centreon instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable File Path:** The attacker needs to know the file path of the vulnerable script (`displayServiceStatus.php`).
- **Basic Understanding of SQL and Command Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious payloads using SQL syntax and shell commands.
- **At Least One User Logged In (Indirect):** While not a strict requirement for exploitation, the exploit is made easier because the SQL injection vulnerability is found in the request that checks for active session (at least one user has to be connected).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the `displayServiceStatus.php` script constructs a command line based on parameters received from the user and executes it using `popen()`.
- The script intends to generate a graph by using the "graph" executable, however, by injecting commands, an attacker is able to bypass this.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in Centreon version 2.5.3. The fix involved the use of `$pearDB->escape()` in order to prevent SQL injection and the usage of  `preg_replace("/(\\$|;\`)/", "", $command);` to prevent command injection.
