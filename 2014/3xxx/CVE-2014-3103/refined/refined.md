{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing 'Secure' attribute in the encrypted session (SSL) cookie used by IBM Rational ClearQuest Web.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Secure Attribute in HTTP Cookie"
    ],
    "impact": "The missing 'Secure' attribute allows the cookie to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, potentially exposing the session ID to eavesdropping and session hijacking.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker can intercept the cookie if the user accesses the application over an insecure (HTTP) connection instead of the secure HTTPS connection that was intended. An attacker on the same network as the user could potentially capture this information.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server, such as being on the same network or having control over network infrastructure. They must be able to capture HTTP traffic and extract the cookie data"
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "IBM Rational ClearQuest Web versions 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.4",
    "IBM Rational ClearQuest Web versions 8.0 through 8.0.0.11",
    "IBM Rational ClearQuest Web versions 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.14",
   "IBM Rational ClearQuest Web versions 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x (all versions and fix packs)"
  ],
  "remediation": "Upgrade to the specified fix pack versions as detailed in the document:  Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 5 (8.0.1.5) for 8.0.1, Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 12 (8.0.0.12) for 8.0, Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 15 (7.1.2.15) for 7.1.2. Note that 7.1.2.15 also addresses the 7.1.1.x versions",
