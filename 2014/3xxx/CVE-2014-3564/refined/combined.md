| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1113267#c0)  Tomáš Trnka    2014-06-25 19:35:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 912217](attachment.cgi?id=912217&action=diff "Patch fixing the overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=912217&action=edit "Patch fixing the overflow") Patch fixing the overflow  Description of problem: A bug in GPGME crashes my KMail reproducibly when opening the private key selection dialog twice in a row.  The crash is due to an overflow of the gpgsm->colon.attic.line buffer within status_handler() in engine-gpgsm.c. This buffer is getting (re)allocated at line 831 like this:  if (gpgsm->colon.attic.linesize < *alinelen + linelen + 1) {     char *newline = realloc (*aline, *alinelen + linelen + 1);     gpgsm->colon.attic.linesize += linelen + 1; ...  So in other words, the code allocates a buffer to be *alinelen + linelen + 1 bytes long, but then thinks its capacity is actually linesize + linelen + 1. This assumption is wrong if *alinelen (the number of bytes used in the buffer prior to reallocation) is lower than linesize (the total length of the buffer), or in other words, if the buffer is not completely full.  In that case, a fragment of the input line is subsequently written past the end of the buffer at line 856:  *dst = *src++;  I'm not sure if it is really exploitable, but in general this routine is processing arbitrary data coming from certificates the user happens to encounter somehow, so one could possibly exploit this using specially crafted certificate or something like that.  Attached is a trivial patch fixing the issue (works fine for me during daily use of KMail with e-mail signing/encryption).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): gpgme-1.3.2-4.fc20.x86_64  How reproducible: Perfectly reproducible for me, but as the bug is data-dependent and I'm not going to publish my keys, I don't have a simple testcase. (I don't think it matters at all as the bug is quite obvious just from the source.)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1113267#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2014-07-29 09:52:46 UTC  ``` I've assigned this [CVE-2014-3564](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3564) and contacted Werner Koch.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1113267#c6)  Stefan Cornelius    2014-07-31 08:35:08 UTC  ``` This is now fixed in gpgme 1.5.1.

Package        : gpgme1.0
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3564
Debian Bug     : 756651

Tomas Trnka discovered a heap-based buffer overflow within the gpgsm
status handler of GPGME, a library designed to make access to GnuPG
easier for applications. An attacker could use this issue to cause an
application using GPGME to crash (denial of service) or possibly to
execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-1.4+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gpgme1.0 packages.

Hi,

Tomáš Trnka discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in gpgme. He has
provided a very good bug report in [1], so I'll refrain from copy
and pasting it here.

This is now fixed in version 1.5.1, the commit fixing this is linked in
[2].

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
