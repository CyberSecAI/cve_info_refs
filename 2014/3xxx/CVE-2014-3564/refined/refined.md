Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `status_handler()` function within `engine-gpgsm.c` of the GPGME library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Buffer Size Calculation:** The code reallocates a buffer using `realloc()`, however it incorrectly updates the tracked buffer size (`gpgsm->colon.attic.linesize`). The code allocates a buffer of size `*alinelen + linelen + 1`, but then updates the size with `linesize += linelen + 1`, which leads to an incorrect size update if the buffer isn't fully utilized before reallocation.
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** Due to the incorrect size tracking, subsequent writes to the buffer using `*dst = *src++;` at line 856 can write past the allocated buffer's end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow can cause the application using GPGME to crash, leading to a denial of service. This is the most immediate and easily observed impact.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The bug report suggests the possibility of arbitrary code execution. Although not confirmed, because the routine processes data coming from certificates that users may encounter, a specially crafted certificate or similar could be used to trigger the overflow in a way that allows for malicious code to be executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Certificates/Data:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted data through the GPGME library. The primary attack vector is via malicious data, possibly including certificates, that the vulnerable GPGME is processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious Data:** An attacker needs to be able to supply malicious data, such as a crafted certificate, to a GPGME enabled application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Tomáš Trnka.
- The issue was fixed in gpgme version 1.5.1.
- Red Hat has classified the security impact as low, but emphasizes the importance of applying the fix promptly.
- The vulnerability has a CVE score of 6.8
