{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated backup functionality in HandsomeWeb SOS Webpages, where the application leaks the correct MD5 key needed for file backup if the provided key is incorrect.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated access to administrative functions",
      "Information disclosure: Leaking of the correct MD5 key for backup functionality",
      "Use of a weak MD5 hash for generating the key, making it trivially reversible.",
	  "Insufficient input validation/authentication of the key in the backup.php script."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain the correct MD5 key required to perform backups of sensitive files. By decrypting the MD5 hash (as suggested by the advisory), attackers can gain the administrator's password and potentially gain full control of the web site.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can access the vulnerable `/backup.php` endpoint without authentication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs no authentication. The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the web server."
