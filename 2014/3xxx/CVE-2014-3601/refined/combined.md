# USN-2357-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

23 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Jack Morgenstein reported a flaw in the page handling of the KVM (Kerenl

Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption)

or possibly have other unspecified impact on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-3601](/security/CVE-2014-3601))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a

denial of service (system crash or reboot). ([CVE-2014-5471](/security/CVE-2014-5471))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive

or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount

process). ([CVE-2014-5472](/security/CVE-2014-5472))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1453-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1453.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1453.73)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter of kvm\_iommu\_put\_pages ([CVE-2014-…](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-58c4-c7v3-ccxc "CVE-2014-3601")

```
[…3601](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-58c4-c7v3-ccxc "CVE-2014-3601"))

The third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages is wrong,
It should be 'gfn - slot->base_gfn'.

By making gfn very large, malicious guest or userspace can cause kvm to
go to this error path, and subsequently to pass a huge value as size.
Alternatively if gfn is small, then pages would be pinned but never
unpinned, causing host memory leak and local DOS.

Passing a reasonable but large value could be the most dangerous case,
because it would unpin a page that should have stayed pinned, and thus
allow the device to DMA into arbitrary memory.  However, this cannot
happen because of the condition that can trigger the error:

- out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page)
  should not be possible for the attacker to trigger

- when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn
  will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside
  kvm_iommu_put_pages() the iommu_iova_to_phys() will fail.  The
  page thus would not be unpinned at all.

# USN-2356-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

23 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jack Morgenstein reported a flaw in the page handling of the KVM (Kerenl

Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption)

or possibly have other unspecified impact on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-3601](/security/CVE-2014-3601))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a

denial of service (system crash or reboot). ([CVE-2014-5471](/security/CVE-2014-5471))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive

or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount

process). ([CVE-2014-5472](/security/CVE-2014-5472))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-69-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-69.103](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-69.103)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Description

The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (2) cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by triggering a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Extension 11 SP3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 21 vulnerabilities and has 69 fixes
is now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3 Realtime kernel was updated to receive
various security and bugfixes.
The following security bugs have been fixed:
\*
CVE-2015-1593: An integer overflow in the stack randomization on
64-bit systems lead to less effective stack ASLR on those systems.
(bsc#917839)
\*
CVE-2014-8160: iptables rules could be bypassed if the specific
network protocol module was not loaded, allowing e.g. SCTP to bypass the
firewall if the sctp protocol was not enabled. (bsc#913059)
\*
CVE-2014-7822: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels
splice() system call validated its parameters. On certain file systems, a
local, unprivileged user could have used this flaw to write past the
maximum file size, and thus crash the system. (bnc#915322)
\*
CVE-2014-9419: The \_\_switch\_to function in
arch/x86/kernel/process\_64.c in the Linux kernel did not ensure that
Thread Local Storage (TLS) descriptors are loaded before proceeding with
other steps, which made it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR
protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a TLS base
address (bnc#911326).
\*
CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel did not validate a length value in the
Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660
image (bnc#912654).
\*
CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly choose memory locations for the vDSO area,
which made it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection
mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a PMD (bnc#912705).
\*
CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux
kernel did not properly maintain the semantics of rename\_lock, which
allowed local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system
hang) via a crafted application (bnc#903640).
\*
CVE-2014-9420: The rock\_continue function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel did not restrict the number of Rock Ridge continuation
entries, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (infinite
loop, and system crash or hang) via a crafted iso9660 image (bsc#911325).
\*
CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in
arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel used an improper
paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which made it easier for
guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted
application that reads a 16-bit value (bnc#907818 909077 909078).
\*
CVE-2014-8369: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel miscalculated the number of pages during the handling
of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of
service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact
by leveraging guest OS privileges. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3601 (bsc#902675).
\*
CVE-2014-3690: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux
kernel on Intel processors did not ensure that the value in the CR4
control register remains the same after a VM entry, which allowed host OS
users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a denial of service (system
disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access, as demonstrated by PR\_SET\_TSC
prctl calls within a modified copy of QEMU (bnc#902232).
\*
CVE-2014-7842: Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
kernel allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS
crash) via a crafted application that performs an MMIO transaction or a
PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace emulation error report, a
similar issue to CVE-2010-5313 (bnc#905312).
\*
CVE-2014-0181: The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel did
not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the
opener of a socket, which allowed local users to bypass intended
access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink
socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program (bnc#875051).
\*
CVE-2014-3688: The SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel allowed
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by
triggering a large number of chunks in an associations output queue, as
demonstrated by ASCONF probes, related to net/sctp/inqueue.c and
net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902351).
\*
CVE-2014-7970: The pivot\_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly interact with certain locations of a
chroot directory, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot\_root
system call (bnc#900644).
\*
CVE-2014-3687: The sctp\_assoc\_lookup\_asconf\_ack function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via
duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork within the
side-effect interpreter (bnc#902349 904899).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

Jack Morgenstein reported a flaw in the page handling of the KVM (Kerenl

Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption)

or possibly have other unspecified impact on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-3601](/security/CVE-2014-3601))

Jason Gunthorpe reported a flaw with SCTP authentication in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS). ([CVE-2014-5077](/security/CVE-2014-5077))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a

denial of service (system crash or reboot). ([CVE-2014-5471](/security/CVE-2014-5471))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive

or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount

process). ([CVE-2014-5472](/security/CVE-2014-5472))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-36.63~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-36.63~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-36.63~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-36.63~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131951#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-08-20 11:36:36 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way iommu mapping failures were handled in kvm_iommu_map_pages() function in the Linux kernel. A privileged user in the guest could use this flaw to crash the host in case the guest has access to passed in device.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Jack Morgenstein of Mellanox for reporting this issue; the security impact of this issue was discovered by Michael Tsirkin of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1131951#c2)  Petr Matousek    2014-08-20 11:41:39 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=350b8bdd689cd2ab2c67c8a86a0be86cfa0751a7>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1131951#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-09-19 09:37:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kvm updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Linux kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1131951#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-10-10 08:45:19 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's kvm_iommu_map_pages() function handled IOMMU mapping failures.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jack Morgenstein reported a flaw in the page handling of the KVM (Kerenl

Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption)

or possibly have other unspecified impact on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-3601](/security/CVE-2014-3601))

Jason Gunthorpe reported a flaw with SCTP authentication in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS). ([CVE-2014-5077](/security/CVE-2014-5077))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a

denial of service (system crash or reboot). ([CVE-2014-5471](/security/CVE-2014-5471))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel's handling of iso9660

(compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom

iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive

or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount

process). ([CVE-2014-5472](/security/CVE-2014-5472))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.13.0-36.63](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-36.63)

* [linux-image-3.13.0-36-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.13.0-36.63](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-36.63)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-36-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.13.0-36.63](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-36.63)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
