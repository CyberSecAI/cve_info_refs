{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-3601",
  "description": "The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (2) cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by triggering a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `kvm_iommu_map_pages` function in the Linux kernel incorrectly calculates the number of pages to unpin during a mapping failure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect calculation of page numbers leading to memory corruption and resource exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest OS user can cause a denial of service on the host OS, potentially leading to:\n  - Host OS memory corruption or other unspecified impact by triggering a large gfn value.\n  - Host OS memory consumption by triggering a small gfn value that results in permanently pinned pages.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious guest OS user can exploit this vulnerability through a crafted gfn value, affecting the iommu mapping."
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within a guest OS that has access to a passed-through device."
