# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20140430-0 >
=======================================================================
              title: SQL injection and persistent XSS
            product: Typo3 3rd party extension si_bibtex
 vulnerable version: si_bibtex 0.2.3
      fixed version: -
             impact: critical
           homepage: <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/si_bibtex>
              found: 2013-09-24

Vendor description:
-------------------
"TYPO3 is an enterprise-class, Open Source CMS (Content Management System),
used internationally to build and manage websites of all types, from small
sites for non-profits to multilingual enterprise solutions for large
corporations."

Source: <http://typo3.org/about/typo3-the-cms/>

Software description:
---------------------
"'BibTex Publications' allows you to import Bibtex files from the front-end
and store them in a sysfolder. The front-end plug-in generates list and single
views of entries and provides a simple search tool. It allows also the
automatic import of BibTex files"

Source: <http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/si_bibtex/0.2.3/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker is able to gain
full access to the Typo3 database. He can use this access to crack the stored
backend user passwords which would then lead to a complete system compromise
on success. Depending on the location where the extension is used in the web
application, this may be possible by an unauthenticated attacker.

It is highly recommended to uninstall the si_bibtex extension until the
vulnerabilities are fixed.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The vulnerable plugin (si_bibtex) is used to import, export and view
bibliography files used for scientific citation. Flaws in the input validation
of this software lead to SQL injection and persistent cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities.

1) SQL injection

The bibtex "search" and "list" allows a user to display specific bibtex items.
Due to insufficient input validation of a parameter, an attacker can inject
into the SQL query statement. By exploiting this vulnerability, an
attacker gains access to all records stored in the database with the
privileges of the Typo3 database user.

2) Persistent cross-site scripting

The bibtex "import" functionality is prone to persistent cross-site scripting
attacks. The vulnerability can be used to include HTML or JavaScript code to
the affected web page. The imported XSS code will be displayed to every user
who calls the "search" or "list" functionality of this extension.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
No proof of concept code available due to missing solution/workaround.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version of the si_bibtex extension has been tested, which was
the most recent version at the time of discovery.
si_bibtex 0.2.3

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2013-11-05: Contacting vendor through security () typo3 org
2013-11-06: Got PGP key from vendor
2013-11-11: Sent the advisory
2014-02-23: Vendor: patch delayed
2014-03-13: Deadline defined for 2014-04-11
2014-04-11: Postponing release of advisory, giving Typo3 team some more time
2014-04-30: Release of security advisory, no patch available

Solution:
---------
No patch available.

Workaround:
-----------
No workaround available.
