Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-3369:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) packets when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) IX filter is configured. This improper handling leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to properly sanitize or handle crafted SDP packets when the IX filter is enabled. This allows malicious input to trigger a vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition by causing the affected system to reload when exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the Cisco TelePresence VCS or Cisco Expressway system to crash and reload, disrupting communication services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attack is carried out by sending specifically crafted SDP packets to the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected Cisco TelePresence VCS or Cisco Expressway system.
*   **Ability to Craft Packets:** The attacker needs the capability to craft malicious SDP packets that can exploit the improper handling.
*   **IX Filter Configuration:** The IX filter must be configured on the affected system for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present when the IX filter is enabled. The configuration can be verified using the command `xconfig zone zone` and checking if the `xConfiguration Zones Zone 2 Neighbor SIP UDP IX Filter Mode` parameter is set to `On`.
*   Cisco assigned the bug ID [CSCuo42252](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo42252) for this issue.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in software version X8.1.1 and later for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability, along with others described in the advisory, is 7.8 (Base Score) and 6.4 (Temporal Score). The CVSS vector is  AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
* There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
