Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way JBoss Keycloak handles QR code generation. Specifically, by requesting a large enough image size for a generated QR code, an attacker could trigger uncontrolled resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper limits on resources consumed during the generation of QR codes. The application does not validate or restrict the size of the requested QR code image.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  This resource consumption can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful attack could lead to legitimate users being unable to access or use the Keycloak service due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **Malicious QR Code Size Request:** An attacker sends a request to the Keycloak server to generate a QR code with a maliciously large image size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Keycloak server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs to know that they can request large QR code images to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
*   The vulnerability is tracked in the upstream issue at `https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-699`.
*   Red Hat has stated that this issue does not affect any supported Red Hat products.
