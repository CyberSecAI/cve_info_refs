  "CVE-2014-3645": {
    "description": "The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest.",
    "root_cause": "The KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully for the invept instruction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of VM exits for the invept instruction in the KVM subsystem."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged guest user could use the invept instruction to crash the guest.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Guest OS executing the invept instruction."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged guest user needs to execute the invept instruction."
