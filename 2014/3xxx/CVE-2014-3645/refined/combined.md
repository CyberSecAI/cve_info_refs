kvm: vmx: handle invvpid vm exit gracefullyOn systems with invvpid instruction support (corresponding bit in
IA32\_VMX\_EPT\_VPID\_CAP MSR is set) guest invocation of invvpid
causes vm exit, which is currently not handled and results in
propagation of unknown exit to userspace.
Fix this by installing an invvpid vm exit handler.

nEPT: Nested INVEPT

```
If we let L1 use EPT, we should probably also support the INVEPT instruction.

In our current nested EPT implementation, when L1 changes its EPT table
for L2 (i.e., EPT12), L0 modifies the shadow EPT table (EPT02), and in
the course of this modification already calls INVEPT. But if last level
of shadow page is unsync not all L1's changes to EPT12 are intercepted,
which means roots need to be synced when L1 calls INVEPT. Global INVEPT
should not be different since roots are synced by kvm_mmu_load() each
time EPTP02 changes.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Debian Bug     : 766195

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service:

CVE-2014-3610

    Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM
    handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
    guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (kernel panic) on the host.

CVE-2014-3611

    Lars Bull of Google reported a race condition in in the PIT
    emulation code in KVM. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o
    ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash)
    on the host.

CVE-2014-3645 / CVE-2014-3646

    The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered
    that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully
    for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and
    invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On
    hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit
    support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions
    to crash the guest.

CVE-2014-3647

    Nadav Amit reported that KVM mishandles noncanonical addresses when
    emulating instructions that change rip, potentially causing a failed
    VM-entry. A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

CVE-2014-3673

    Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered a flaw in net/core/skbuff.c leading to
    a kernel panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3687

    A flaw in the sctp stack was discovered leading to a kernel panic
    when receiving duplicate ASCONF chunks. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3688

    It was found that the sctp stack is prone to a remotely triggerable
    memory pressure issue caused by excessive queueing. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to cause denial-of-service conditions
    on the system.

CVE-2014-3690

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that incorrect register handling in KVM
    may lead to denial of service.

CVE-2014-7207

    Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
    subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or a
    virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

This update includes a bug fix related to CVE-2014-7207 that disables
UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and virtio_net
drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from a host running
an earlier kernel version to a host running this kernel version to fail,
if the VM has been assigned a virtio network device. In order to migrate
such a VM, it must be shut down first.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

In __kvm_migrate_pit_timer the pit_timer object is accessed without synchronization.  A local guest user with access to the PIT i/o ports could use this flaw to crash the host.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-09-21 12:32:49 UTC  ``` On systems with invept instruction support (corresponding bit in IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP MSR is set) guest invocation of invept causes vm exit, which is currently not handled and causes unknown exit error to be propagated to userspace.  A local unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest.  Upstream fix:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bfd0a56b90005f8c8a004baf407ad90045c2b11e>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-15 10:37:58 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Future updates may address this issue in the respective Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases.   This issue does affect the kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0126)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A heap-based buffer overflow was found in glibc's
\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() function, which is used by the gethostbyname()
and gethostbyname2() glibc function calls. A remote attacker able to make
an application call either of these functions could use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application. (CVE-2015-0235)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem
handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has
access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2014-3611)

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server
using OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server
supported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)

A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session
ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all available
memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number of invalid
session tickets to that server. (CVE-2014-3567)

It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM
exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT)
and invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts
with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged
guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-3645,
CVE-2014-3646)

Red Hat would like to thank Qualys for reporting the CVE-2015-0235 issue,
Lars Bull of Google for reporting the CVE-2014-3611 issue, and the Advanced
Threat Research team at Intel Security for reporting the CVE-2014-3645 and
CVE-2014-3646 issues.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1456-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1456.76](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1456.76)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM

subsystem handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user
who has access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2014-3611, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation

validated INIT chunks when performing Address Configuration Change
(ASCONF). A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by
sending a specially crafted SCTP packet to trigger a NULL pointer
dereference on the system. (CVE-2014-7841, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the ipc\_rcu\_putref() function in the Linux

kernel's IPC implementation handled reference counter decrementing.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger an Out of Memory
(OOM) condition and, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2013-4483,
Moderate)

* A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech

WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request
Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2014-3185, Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM

exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT)
and invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts
with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged
guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-3645,
CVE-2014-3646, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem

handled generic protocol tracking. As demonstrated in the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) case, a remote attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended iptables rule restrictions when the associated connection
tracking module was not loaded on the system. (CVE-2014-8160, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google for reporting
CVE-2014-3611, Vladimir Davydov (Parallels) for reporting CVE-2013-4483,
and the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security for reporting
CVE-2014-3645 and CVE-2014-3646. The CVE-2014-7841 issue was discovered by
Liu Wei of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* When forwarding a packet, the iptables target TCPOPTSTRIP used the

tcp\_hdr() function to locate the option space. Consequently, TCPOPTSTRIP
located the incorrect place in the packet, and therefore did not match
options for stripping. TCPOPTSTRIP now uses the TCP header itself to locate
the option space, and the options are now properly stripped. (BZ#1172026)

* The ipset utility computed incorrect values of timeouts from an old IP

set, and these values were then supplied to a new IP set. A resize on an IP
set with a timeouts option enabled could then supply corrupted data from an
old IP set. This bug has been fixed by properly reading timeout values from
an old set before supplying them to a new set. (BZ#1172763)

* Incorrect processing of errors from the BCM5719 LAN controller could

result in incoming packets being dropped. Now, received errors are handled
properly, and incoming packets are no longer randomly dropped. (BZ#1180405)

* When the NVMe driver allocated a name-space queue, it was recognized as a

request-based driver, whereas it was a BIO-based driver. While trying to
access data during the loading of NVMe along with a request-based DM
device, the system could terminate unexpectedly or become unresponsive.
Now, NVMe does not set the QUEUE\_FLAG\_STACKABLE flag during the allocation
of a name-space queue, and the system no longer attempts to insert a
request into the queue, preventing a crash. (BZ#1180554)

All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-09-21 12:32:49 UTC  ``` On systems with invept instruction support (corresponding bit in IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP MSR is set) guest invocation of invept causes vm exit, which is currently not handled and causes unknown exit error to be propagated to userspace.  A local unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest.  Upstream fix:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bfd0a56b90005f8c8a004baf407ad90045c2b11e>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-15 10:37:58 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Future updates may address this issue in the respective Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases.   This issue does affect the kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-10-28 21:34:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2014:1724 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1724.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c7)  Martin Prpič    2014-10-29 12:39:18 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) instructions. On hosts with an Intel processor and invept VM exit support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-11-11 15:34:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1843 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1843.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-02-04 17:52:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2015:0126 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0126.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1144835#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-03 12:50:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2015:0284 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0284.html>   ``` |  |
