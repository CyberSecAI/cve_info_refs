## Description

[![@zanchey](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/520741?u=1c0b65fc9912e8a3a3470bfed7b513dd57871e8a&v=4&size=48)](/zanchey)[zanchey](https://github.com/zanchey)opened [on Apr 28, 2014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1440#issue-32369633)

Both `__fish_print_packages` and (in master, not in any releases) `start_fishd` access temporary files in `/tmp` blindly, allowing a symlink attack.

This is somewhat defended against by the sysctl `fs.protected_symlinks` in newer releases of Linux, thankfully.

CVE-ID is [CVE-2014-3219](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x4v8-3282-qp44 "CVE-2014-3219").

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Subject: Security release of fish shell 2.1.1

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

It's been some months, but it seems like a good time to be announcing
security releases of shells!

fish (the friendly interactive shell) is a smart and user-friendly command
line shell for OS X, Linux, and the rest of the family.

fish 2.1.1 has been released as source and binary packages at
<http://fishshell.com/>.

This release fixes a number of local privilege escalation vulnerability
and one remote code execution vulnerability, as follows:

CVE-2014-2905: fish universal variable socket vulnerable to permission
bypass leading to privilege escalation

  fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), does not
  check the credentials of processes communicating over the fishd universal
  variable server UNIX domain socket. This allows a local attacker to
  elevate their privileges to those of a target user running fish, including
  root.

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1436>

CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-3856: fish temporary file creation vulnerable to
race condition leading to privilege escalation

  fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), creates
  temporary files in an insecure manner.

  Versions 1.23.0 to 2.1.0 (inclusive) execute code via `funced` from these
  temporary files, allowing privilege escalation to those of any user
  running fish, including root. (CVE-2014-3856)

  Additionally, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive),
  fish will read data using the psub function from these temporary files,
  meaning that the input of commands used with the psub function is under
  the control of the attacker. (CVE-2014-2906)

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1437>

CVE-2014-2914: fish web interface does not restrict access leading to remote
code execution

  fish, from version 2.0.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), fails to restrict
  connections to the Web-based configuration service (fish_config). This
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the
  user running fish_config.

  The service is generally only running for short periods of time.

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish,
  although the use of the fish_config tool is optional as other interfaces
  to fish configuration are available.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1438>

CVE-2014-3219: fish temporary file access leading to privilege escalation

  fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), uses
  temporary files in an insecure manner.

  fish will read and write completions from these temporary files without
  checking for ownership or symbolic links, allowing data corruption.

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.

## Description

[![@zanchey](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/520741?u=1c0b65fc9912e8a3a3470bfed7b513dd57871e8a&v=4&size=48)](/zanchey)[zanchey](https://github.com/zanchey)opened [on Apr 28, 2014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1438#issue-32327897)

Before [6d74978](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/6d749789ce240a3e6f1447777db63fd8e7525560) and [44b35f7](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/44b35f773529f1cfc046aed8734de05585b3c2da) anyone\* could connect to a running fish\_config server and send code to (e.g.) set\_prompt, which is obviously bad.

That's been clamped down to localhost-only now, which helps, but it's still possible for someone on your local machine to wait for you to start fish\_config and then talk to the server.

There's a perfect API for verifying who is on the other end of a local IP/IPv6 socket - getpeerucred(3). Unfortunately, it's only available on Solaris.

We could include an authentication key in the URL, but that could be read from the command line.

First, we should mention that a single CVE ID cannot be used for a set
of related issues that have different affected versions. For the
earlier message that mentioned CVE-2014-2906 and CVE-2014-2914,
approximately two more CVE IDs will be needed. We will send those
later.

For "a symlink attack that doesn't depend on a race condition,"
ultimately the answer is yes, you can have a separate CVE ID - use
CVE-2014-3219. Probably at least a few oss-security readers would want
us to explain why, so here's the explanation for them.

When there are discoveries of two instances of essentially the same
composite, and there's any difference in the set of weaknesses for
those two instances, we might want to have a general rule that two
separate CVE IDs are always assigned. In practice, the Symlink
Following composite is treated as somewhat of a special case in CVE.
If we have one Symlink Following instance associated with two
weaknesses, and a different Symlink Following instance associated with
three weaknesses, we sometimes assign only one CVE ID. Possibly we
will reevaluate that. (There's also often a complication that the
available information is only that distinct Symlink Following
instances exist; the information about the weaknesses is missing.)

For the code fixed in the
<https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/c0989dce2d882c94eb3183e7b94402ba53534abb>
commit, an additional factor is that the Symlink Following composite
exists and is relevant, but there's a more important attack that does
not rely on Symlink Following. In between when the temporary filename
is chosen and when the temporary filename is used, the attacker can
place something at the temporary pathname. One option is a symlink,
and fish will follow that symlink and perhaps overwrite an important
file. Another option is a plain world writable file. In that case,
fish writes to the file, but the attacker can change the contents of
the file immediately before fish proceeds to execute the file. Thus,
even if we did the abstraction based on "same commonly used composite
name," we would still end up with a different CVE ID than for the new
"symlink attack that doesn't depend on a race condition" report,
because the pre-c0989dce2d882c94eb3183e7b94402ba53534abb code isn't
solely characterized by a Symlink Following composite. Finally, we
probably don't want to have two CVE IDs for a single case where mktemp
is introduced - even when both Symlink Following and (roughly
speaking) code injection are possible from the same set of weaknesses.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1092091#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-04-28 17:54:48 UTC  ``` A number of vulnerabilities were reported in fish versions prior to 2.1.1 [1]:  CVE-2014-2905: fish universal variable socket vulnerable to permission bypass leading to privilege escalation    fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), does not   check the credentials of processes communicating over the fishd universal   variable server UNIX domain socket. This allows a local attacker to elevate   their privileges to those of a target user running fish, including root.    fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.    <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1436>  CVE-2014-2906: fish temporary file creation vulnerable to race condition leading to privilege escalation    fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), creates   temporary files in an insecure manner.    Versions 1.23.0 to 2.1.0 (inclusive) execute code from these temporary files,   allowing privilege escalation to those of any user running fish, including   root.    Additionally, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive),   fish will read data using the psub function from these temporary files,   meaning that the input of commands used with the psub function is under the   control of the attacker.    fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.    <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1437>  CVE-2014-2914: fish web interface does not restrict access leading to remote code execution    fish, from version 2.0.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), fails to restrict   connections to the Web-based configuration service (fish_config). This   allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user   running fish_config.    The service is generally only running for short periods of time.    fish version 2.1.1 restricts incoming connections to localhost only. At this   stage, users should avoid running fish_config on systems where there are   untrusted local users, as they are still able to connect to the fish_config   service and elevate their privileges to those of the user running   fish_config.    No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish, although   the use of the fish_config tool is optional as other interfaces to fish   configuration are available.    <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1438>  The patches going into 2.1.1 can be retrieved from the Integration_2.1.1 branch on Github if you would like to patch your own source or packages without updating to 2.1.1: <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/tree/Integration_2.1.1>   10642a34f17ae45bd93be3ae6021ee920d3da0c2   8412c867a501e3a68e55fef6215e86d3ac9f617b   c0989dce2d882c94eb3183e7b94402ba53534abb  Although at this stage we won't be issuing a 2.0.1 release, the patches have been backported to the 2.0.0 branch for distributions that would prefer not to upgrade to the 2.1 series: <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/tree/Integration_2.0.1>   216d32055d99fbae563ad048436830187a8bfceb   aea9ad4965d24ef9c4e346f906194820bac70cc9   55986120aa2cc8ab0809db8ca1f8116491c1fb14   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/04/28/4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1092091#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-04-28 17:56:54 UTC  ``` Also, according to the Debian bug report [2] there is another symlink-based vulnerability for which a CVE has not yet been assigned, and for which a patch will be available shortly.

This bug is specifically for [CVE-2014-3219](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3219) -- if there are other issues, they will get their own CVEs and will have bugs opened for them as appropriate.  This has been fixed in Fedora 19 and 20 (thank you!) so it can now be closed.   ``` |  |
