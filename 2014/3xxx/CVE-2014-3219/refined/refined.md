  "CVE-2014-3219": {
    "Description": "fish before 2.1.1 allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on (1) /tmp/fishd.log.%s, (2) /tmp/.pac-cache.$USER, (3) /tmp/.yum-cache.$USER, or (4) /tmp/.rpm-cache.$USER.",
    "Root cause": "The application uses temporary files in an insecure manner, where it reads and writes completions from these temporary files without checking for ownership or symbolic links.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of temporary files",
      "Symlink vulnerability",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can write to arbitrary files and corrupt data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a local user on the system."
