core: Follow up to [r1897460](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1897460): Implement and use ap_thread_current_after_fork().

thread_local variables are not (always?) reset on fork(), so we need a way
to set the current_thread to NULL in the child process.

Implement and use ap_thread_current_after_fork() for that.

* include/httpd.h:
  Define ap_thread_current_after_fork().

* server/util.c:
  Implement ap_thread_current_after_fork().

* server/mpm/event/event.c, server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c,
    server/mpm/worker/worker.c:
  Use ap_thread_current_after_fork().

* server/mpm/winnt/child.c:
  Windows processes are not fork()ed and each child runs the main(), so
  ap_thread_current_create() was already called there.

core: Efficient ap_thread_current() with APR < 1.8.

#define ap_thread_create, ap_thread_current_create and ap_thread_current to
their apr-1.8+ equivalent if available, or implement them using the compiler's
thread_local mechanism if available, or finally provide stubs otherwise.

#define AP_HAS_THREAD_LOCAL to 1 in the two former case or 0 otherwise, while
AP_THREAD_LOCAL is defined to the compiler's keyword iff AP_HAS_THREAD_LOCAL.

Replace all apr_thread_create() calls with ap_thread_create() so that httpd
threads can use ap_thread_current()'s pool data as Thread Local Storage.

Bump MMN minor.

* include/httpd.h():
  Define AP_HAS_THREAD_LOCAL, AP_THREAD_LOCAL (eventually), ap_thread_create(),
  ap_thread_current_create() and ap_thread_current().

* server/util.c:
  Implement ap_thread_create(), ap_thread_current_create() and
  ap_thread_current() when APR < 1.8.

* modules/core/mod_watchdog.c, modules/http2/h2_workers.c,
    modules/ssl/mod_ssl_ct.c:
  Use ap_thread_create() instead of apr_thread_create.

* server/main.c:
  Use AP_HAS_THREAD_LOCAL and ap_thread_current_create instead of APR's.

* server/util_pcre.c:
  Use AP_HAS_THREAD_LOCAL and ap_thread_current instead of APR's.

* server/mpm/event/event.c, server/mpm/worker/worker.c,
    server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c:
  Use ap_thread_create() instead of apr_thread_create.
  Create an apr_thread_t/ap_thread_current() for the main chaild thread usable
  at child_init().

* server/mpm/winnt/child.c:
  Use ap_thread_create() instead of CreateThread().
  Create an apr_thread_t/ap_thread_current() for the main chaild thread usable

```
In winnt_accept() (server/mpm/winnt/child.c), there's a call to PostQueuedCompletionStatus() with a buffer (BytesRead) for the number of bytes read.

When compiling the code with Visual Studio 2019 (v 16.3.10), we get a warning than BytesRead is not initialized. When using /RTCu (run-time checks for uninitialzed variables), the program crashes on this line with an exception.

If we initialize the variable to 0, the problem is solved.

PR 63965

event, worker: runtime pool.

MPMs event and worker both need a dedicated pool to handle the creation of
the threads (listener, workers) and synchronization objects (queues, pollset,
mutexes...) in the start_threads() thread, with at least the lifetime of
the connections they handle, and thus survive pchild destruction (notably
in ONE_PROCCESS mode, but SIG_UNGRACEFUL is concerned too).

For instance, without this fix, the below backtrace can happen in ONE_PROCCESS
mode and a signal/^C is received (with active connections):

Thread 1 "httpd" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

While at it, add comments about the lifetimes of MPMs pools and their objects,
and give each pool a tag (e.g. "pchild" accordingly to other MPMs).

(follow up for event_pollset in [r1835846](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1835846)).

mpm_winnt: Do not redefine the standard CONTAINING_RECORD() macro
in child.c.

This definition has been added in <https://svn.apache.org/r88498> — perhaps,
because not every versions of SDK contained it at that time.

But since then, the macro has been available starting from Windows 2000
(<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff542043>),
and any available version of Windows SDK now should also contain it.

mpm_winnt: Tweak the names of the variables in child.c which are used to
represent a queue of the completion contexts.

Starting from [r1801655](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1801655), the "queue" isn't really a queue, as all the
access happens with a LIFO order. So, instead of that, call it a "pool

mpm_winnt: Tweak the listener shutdown code to use a separate event
instead of the global variable (shutdown_in_progress).

This change has two purposes.  First of all, it makes the listener threads
which are blocked waiting for a completion context exit immediately during
shutdown.  Previously, such threads would only check for exit every second.
The second reason for this change is to put the child_main() function in
charge of controlling the listeners life cycle.  Previously, such relation
was circumvented by the fact that the listeners were also waiting for the
global child exit_event.  With the new separate listener_shutdown_event,
only the child_main() function is responsible for shutting down the
listeners, and I think that this makes the code a bit clearer.

All the original behavior, including the special APLOG_DEBUG diagnostic
message when we fail to acquire a free completion context in 1 second,
is kept unchanged.

```
mpm_winnt: Use a LIFO stack instead of a FIFO queue to hold unused
completion contexts, as that may significantly reduce the memory usage.

This simple change can have a noticeable impact on the amount of memory
consumed by the child process in various cases.  Every completion context
in the queue has an associated allocator, and every allocator has it's
ap_max_mem_free memory limit which is not given back to the operating
system.  Once the queue grows, it cannot shrink back, and every allocator
in each of the queued completion contexts keeps up to its max_free amount
of memory.  The queue can only grow when a server has to serve multiple
concurrent connections at once.

With that in mind, consider a case with a server that doesn't encounter many
concurrent connections most of the time, but has occasional spikes when
it has to serve multiple concurrent connections.  During such spikes, the
size of the completion context queue grows.

The actual difference between using LIFO and FIFO orders shows up after
such spikes, when the server is back to light load and doesn't see a lot
of concurrency.  With FIFO order, every completion context in the queue
will be used in a round-robin manner, thus using *every* available allocator
one by one and ultimately claiming up to (N * ap_max_mem_free memory) from
the OS.  With LIFO order, only the completion contexts that are close to
the top of the stack will be used and reused for subsequent connections.
Hence, only a small part of the allocators will be used, and this can
prevent all other allocators from unnecessarily acquiring memory from
the OS (and keeping it), and this reduces the overall memory footprint.

Please note that this change doesn't affect the worst case behavior, as
it's still (N * ap_max_mem_free memory), but tends to behave better in
practice, for the reasons described above.

Another thing worth considering is the new behavior when the OS decides
to swap out pages of the child process, for example, in a close-to-OOM
condition.  Handling every new connection after the swap requires the OS
to load the memory pages for the allocator from the completion context that
is used for this connection.  With FIFO order, the completion contexts are
used one by one, and this would cause page loads for every new connection.
With LIFO order, there will be almost no swapping, since the same completion
context is going to be reused for subsequent new connections.

mpm_winnt: Drop the APLOG_DEBUG diagnostic saying how many thread
are blocked on the I/O completion port during the shutdown.

Prior to [r1801635](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1801635), the shutdown code required to know the amount of blocked
threads, as it has been dispatching the same amount of completion packets.
But this no longer holds, and the only reason why we maintain the
corresponding g_blocked_threads variable is because of this debug
diagnostic message.

Drop it in order to reduce complexity of the quite critical code in the
winnt_get_connection() function and to reduce the amount of global
variables.

mpm_winnt: Remove an unnecessary Sleep() in the winnt_accept() function.

This sleep occured in a situation when:

 - We don't have a free completion context in the queue
 - We can't add one, as doing so would exceed the max_num_completion_contexts
   limit (all worker threads are busy)
 - We have exceeded a 1 second timeout while waiting for it

In this case, the Sleep() call is unnecessary, as there is no intermittent
failure that can be waited out, but rather than that, it's an ordinary
situation with all workers being busy.  Presumably, calling Sleep() here
can be even considered harmful, as it affects the fairness between the
listeners that are blocked waiting for the completion context.

So, instead of calling Sleep() just check for the possible shutdown and
immediately retry acquiring a completion context.  If all worker threads
are still busy, the retry will block in the same WaitForSingleObject() call,
which is fine.

```

mpm_winnt: Simplify the shutdown code that was waiting for multiple worker
thread handles in batches.

Starting from [r1801636](/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1801636), there is no difference between ending the wait with
one or multiple remaining threads.  This is because we terminate the process
if at least one thread is still active when we hit a timeout.

Therefore, instead of making an effort to evenly distribute and batch the
handles with WaitForMultipleObjects(), we could just start from one end,
and wait for one thread handle at a time.

mpm_winnt: Avoid using TerminateThread() in case the shutdown routine
hits a timeout while waiting for the worker threads to exit.

Using TerminateThread() can have dangerous consequences such as deadlocks —
say, if the the thread is terminated while holding a lock or a heap lock
in the middle of HeapAlloc(), as these locks would not be released.
Or it can corrupt the application state and cause a crash.

(See <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686717>)

Rework the code to call TerminateProcess() in the described circumstances
and leave the cleanup to the operating system.

mpm_winnt: Make the shutdown faster by avoiding unnecessary Sleep()'s
when shutting down the worker threads.

Previously, the shutdown code was posting an amount of I/O completion
packets equal to the amount of the threads blocked on the I/O completion
port.  Then it would Sleep() until all these threads "acknowledge" the
completion packets by decrementing the global amount of blocked threads.

A better way would be to send the number of IOCP_SHUTDOWN completion
packets equal to the total amount of threads and immediately proceed to
the next step.  There is no need to block until the threads actually receive
the completion, as the shutdown process includes a separate step that waits
until the threads exit, and the new approach avoids an unnecessary delay.

mpm_winnt: clear OVERLAPPED structs before reuse

MSDN documentation states that

    Any unused members of [an OVERLAPPED] structure should always be
    initialized to zero before the structure is used in a function call.
    Otherwise, the function may fail and return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

Prior to this patch, the internal state left over from previous
overlapped I/O was passed into the next call. It's unclear what effect
this might have, if any. (I have not personally witnessed an
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER myself.)

mpm_winnt: remove the AcceptEx data network bucket

Follow-up to the prior commit: without an incoming data buffer, the
custom network bucket code is now orphaned and we can remove it
entirely. This has the added benefit that we are no longer using the
internal OVERLAPPED.Pointer field, which is discouraged by the MSDN
docs.

mpm_winnt: remove 'data' AcceptFilter in favor of 'connect'

The 'data' AcceptFilter optimization instructs Windows to wait until
data is received on a connection before completing the AcceptEx
operation. Unfortunately, it seems this isn't performed atomically --
AcceptEx "partially" accepts the incoming connection during the wait for
data, leaving all other incoming connections in the accept queue. This
opens the server to a denial of service.

Since the fix for this requires a substantial rearchitecture (likely
involving multiple outstanding calls to AcceptEx), disable the 'data'
filter for now and replace it with 'connect', which uses the AcceptEx
interface but does not wait for data.

Users running prior releases of httpd on Windows should explicitly move
to a 'connect' AcceptFilter in their configurations if they are
currently using the default 'data' filter.

Many thanks to mludha, Arthur Ramsey, Paul Spangler, and many others for
their assistance in tracking down and diagnosing this issue.

PR: 59970

```

  Ensure http2 follows http in the meaning of
  status WRITE (meaning 'in the request processing
  phase' even if still consuming the request body,
  not literally in a 'now writing' state).

  Ensure a number of MPMs and the h2 connection io
  no longer clobber the request status line during
  state-only changes.  While at it, clean up some
  very ugly formatting and unnecessary decoration,
  and avoid the wordy _from_conn() flavor when we
  are not passing a connection_rec.

  Ensure the useragent_ip is only used in the case
  where it has been initialized, fall back on the
  connection's remote_ip if the status is accidently
  updated from an uninitialized request_rec.

```
In 2.4, the MPM leaves a copy of the non-disconnected FD sitting in
context->accept_socket. This FD will be closed a second time, often
shortly after a worker picks it up in this same FD being reused.  The
first recv fails with WSAENOTSOCK since the same FD was closed in the
listener thread while the worker was pulling it off the queue

(The second close is of the underlying FD/socket, not a shared
apr_socket_t, so it's not short-circuited)

This patch makes it a bit more 2.2.x-ish and solves my problem -- the
context->accept_socket gets zapped at the bottom of the loop if
!disconnected.

WinNT MPM: Fix thread-safety issue in worker_main().  All
workers were allocating from pchild without holding '
child_lock.  Allocate from ptrans instead.

Related to: PR 52196

The reporter suggests that the apr_thread_t for r->connection->current_thread
should have a unique pool.  This revision handles that for WinNT MPM,
but not for other MPMs.

```
Introduce ap_(get|set)_core_module_config() functions/macros and use them
everywhere.

We know that the core module has module_index 0. Therefore we can save
some pointer operations in ap_get_module_config(cv, &core_module) and
ap_set_module_config(cv, &core_module, val). As these are called rather often,
this may actually have some (small) measurable effect.

This is rather irritating.

We override exit() throughout the httpd build in order to intercept and
report our status through the service control manager.

We must include process.h prior to overriding exit().

I seem to remember that this is the reason apr.hw once included
process.h unilaterally, to avoid this conflict over exit.

fix some logging glitches in the WinNT MPM:

the MPM's equivalent of "reached MaxClients" is now ERR instead of
WARNING

the message when the MPM child exits due to excessive errors is
raised from ERR to CRIT

the caller of mpm_get_completion_context() could log random error
values (GetLastError() or rv), so solve as follows:

. mpm_get_completion_context() always logs its errors
. caller only logs when it is taking a rare action on such errors, and
  doesn't pretend to know the error code of the last such error

Stop explicitly including the current pid in WinNT MPM messages,
as it is part of the default log format.  (And these lines needed
touching anyway since %d was the wrong format string.)

Until APR is actually fixed between apr_os_sock_make and the logic
within apr_socket_timeout_set, let's presume that vendor differences
of socket stack drivers can vary this behavior, and the assumptions
were unsafe for both accept() and AcceptEx().

Use a single event for the lifetime of the 'AcceptFilter none' variety

```
Introduce Win32 AcceptFilter handling.

Divided into 3 classes, this implements the first two;

 * AcceptFilter 'data' - much as on Unix, accept will not complete
   until data is ready to be accepted.  Unlike Unix, it will actually
   fetch the first bucket full of data from the tcp socket, and this
   patch implements passing that bucket into the core net brigade
   in front of the accepted socket.

 * AcceptFilter 'connect' - just as in Apache 2.2, accept will not
   complete until three way handshake is complete and the endpoints
   are resolved, and quickly grabs the endpoint addresses using the
   AcceptEx API (which some people have problems with).  This will
   not be the default.

 * AcceptFilter 'none' [not yet implemented] - will be the traditional
   select/WSAAccept style processing for broken network socket stacks
   and more trivial tcp style connections.  If AcceptEx appears to be
   a problem, the listener will be able to downgrade to 'none'.

Reimplement ThreadStackSize to behave as on unix for any
Windows 2003/2008 (XP/Vista) servers.  Virtual allocations
will only consume pages once referenced, while the page
alignment will vary by ThreadStackSize setting so that the
maximum number of threads and minimum stack VM profile will
be wasted.

Fix return values from wait_for_many_objects.
The return value is index to the signaled thread in

We can not use WAIT_TIMEOUT as return value
because its value is defined as 258, thus limiting
the MaxThreads to that value that leads to the
assertion errors.

Threaded MPMs for Unix and Win32: Add WorkerStackSize directive
to override default thread stack size for threads which handle
client connections.  Required for some third-party modules on
platforms with small default thread stack size.

This is also useful for trimming back the stack size on
platforms with relatively large default stack size in order to
conserve address space for supporting more threads per child.

  Conditionally revert the otherchild logic from the WinNT MPM, based on
  the APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD flag from APR.  This gets us building again
  on win32.

  Lots o bugs and emits here.  accept_socket is a handle, although vc and
  the psdk aren't good about remembering that.  never use GetLastError()

  Outch!  Always check completion against actual socket/pipe/file handles,
  never look at the completion event itself.  Could be part of the zone
  alarm mischief.  Note also that waiting on two events is better than
  waking every few minutes.  Factoring out max_requests_per_child_hit
  or whatever that event name is will help here.

  Refactor out the child behavior from mpm_winnt.  This is the first
  step in making a legible multiprocess windows mpm, or at least
  structuring the code to always begin a new child as an old one is
  going to die soon, rather than waiting for it's final dying breath.

  The only code that had to be affected [due to the split and general
  structure of the code] was merging the set_listeners_noninherited()
  code directly into the get_listeners_from_parent code, and also into
  the apr socket.c code for winnt.  For the most part the code splits
  rather nicely.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c0)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-21 06:46:47 UTC  ``` The following flaw has been fixed in the Apache HTTP Server:  "A flaw was found in the WinNT MPM in httpd versions 2.4.1 to 2.4.9, when using the default AcceptFilter for that platform. A remote attacker could send carefully crafted requests that would leak memory and eventually lead to a denial of service against the server."  External References:  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c1)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-22 07:54:50 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:   <https://github.com/apache/httpd/commit/c17f0b89657cf03318fe2b624adc92cae477f81b>  Code not present in 2.2   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c2)  Grant Murphy    2014-07-22 08:44:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not affected. This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7, Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 and 6. This flaw only affects httpd running on Microsoft Windows. Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 and 6 can be run on Microsoft Windows. However, these products provide httpd 2.2, which is not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-07-23 06:47:29 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1610652>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c4)  JBoss JIRA Server    2016-09-06 13:20:40 UTC  ``` Michal Karm Babacek <mbabacek> updated the status of jira [JWS-433](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JWS-433) to Resolved   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1121519#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-15 22:13:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Via RHSA-2016:2957 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=801648#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-03-09 04:54:47 UTC  ```  Tim Boddy reported a memory leak in poolGrow [1]  This bug applies at least to 1.95.8, 2.0.0 and 2.0.1  poolGrow in xml.parse.cpp has the following block of code:     if (pool->blocks && pool->start == pool->blocks->s) {     int blockSize = (int)(pool->end - pool->start)*2;     pool->blocks = (BLOCK *)       pool->mem->realloc_fcn(pool->blocks,                              (offsetof(BLOCK, s)                               + blockSize * sizeof(XML_Char)));     if (pool->blocks == NULL)       return XML_FALSE;     pool->blocks->size = blockSize;     pool->ptr = pool->blocks->s + (pool->ptr - pool->start);     pool->start = pool->blocks->s;     pool->end = pool->start + blockSize;   } It looks like this will cause a memory leak if realloc_fcn returns NULL because pool->blocks will be overwritten but the old memory area to which it pointed won't be freed.   The other places where reallocation is done in this file (via the REALLOC macro) don't have this bug because they correctly store the result in a temporary variable.   This bug allows a serious DOS attack on a server that accepts XML-based requests if a request is seen of the following form:  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY a "1234567890" > <!ENTITY b "&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;" > <!ENTITY c "&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;&b;" > <!ENTITY d "&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;&c;" > <!ENTITY e "&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;" > <!ENTITY f "&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;&e;" > <!ENTITY g "&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;&f;" > <!ENTITY h "&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;&g;" > <!ENTITY i "&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;&h;" > <!ENTITY j "&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;&i;" > <!ENTITY k "&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;&j;" > <!ENTITY l "&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;&k;" > <!ENTITY m "&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;&l;" > <!ENTITY n "&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;&m;" > ]> <foo bar="&n;"/>  When the attribute is expanded, the realloc (assuming that it bounds the size of the request) will fail, leaking the buffer from before the realloc.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### low: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with initial windows size 0 ([CVE-2023-43622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43622))

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.56

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

Acknowledgements: Apache HTTP server would like to thank LI ZHI XIN from NSFoucs for reporting this.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

### low: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request ([CVE-2018-1301](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1301))

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerabilty hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod\_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.
