Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3523:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content includes a revision log of the file `/httpd/httpd/trunk/server/mpm/winnt/child.c`, and revision `1610652` specifically mentions `SECURITY (CVE-2014-3523): Fix a memory consumption denial of service in the WinNT MPM used in all Windows installations.` This confirms the content's relevance to CVE-2014-3523.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The vulnerability was a memory consumption denial of service in the WinNT MPM. The root cause is related to how the WinNT MPM handled the `AcceptFilter` configuration.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Memory Leak**: When using the default `AcceptFilter` on the WinNT MPM, crafted requests could trigger a memory leak that would eventually lead to a denial-of-service. Specifically, the issue arises when the "data" AcceptFilter instructs Windows to wait until data is received before completing the AcceptEx operation. This process was not atomic, leading to partially accepted connections and leaving other connections in the accept queue, making the server vulnerable to denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted requests, causing the server to leak memory and eventually crash or become unresponsive. The vulnerability could cause memory exhaustion.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Remote**: A remote attacker could send malicious HTTP requests to the server to trigger the vulnerability.
   - **Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to send carefully crafted requests to trigger the memory leak in the WinNT MPM.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server to send the malicious requests.
   - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Additional Technical Details**
   - The vulnerability is located within the WinNT MPM's handling of the AcceptEx API which is used by the `data` AcceptFilter.
   - The fix involved a change to avoid the "data" AcceptFilter, replacing it with 'connect', which uses the AcceptEx interface but does not wait for data.
   - The workaround suggested in revision `1610652` was to configure `AcceptFilter <protocol> {none|connect}`.
   - The vulnerability was fixed by revision `1610652`.
   - The issue was present in httpd versions 2.4.1 to 2.4.9
