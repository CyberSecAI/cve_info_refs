Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `redhat-upgrade-tool` did not properly check GPG signatures on packages downloaded and installed during the upgrade process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing GPG Signature Verification:** The tool failed to verify the GPG signatures of downloaded packages. This means that if a malicious actor managed to compromise the package source or perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, they could replace legitimate packages with malicious ones, and the `redhat-upgrade-tool` would install them without any warning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By substituting legitimate packages with malicious ones, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the target system during the upgrade process, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Package Source:** An attacker could compromise the source from which the `redhat-upgrade-tool` downloads the packages.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the target system and the package source and replace legitimate packages with malicious ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Control/Access:** For a MITM attack, the attacker needs to have a position where they can intercept network traffic between the target system and the package source.
- **Compromise Package Source:** For compromising the package source, attacker would require ability to compromise the package server/repo.
