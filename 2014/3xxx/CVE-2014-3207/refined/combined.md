How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

assigned to rforbes for verif, this looks like a scanner false positive to me. I took a quick look at the url in question and I don't see a way for this to be exploited.Assignee: nobody → rforbesFlags: sec-bounty?Whiteboard: Haris Mamoun → [site:gpg.mozilla.org][reporter-external][verif?]

It is a reflected XSS.
Its verified, not false positive.

Modern browsers escape the request so the reflected page does not contain an XSS attack. Using command-line tools like curl or maybe old versions of IE don't do this escaping so it can look like a successful attack.
Joe: who stood up this server? I'm guessing someone in your team, but the real bug (such as it is) is almost certainly in the upsteam SKS code. Maybe there's a newer version, or maybe they've got a fix.Assignee: rforbes → jstevensenFlags: needinfo?(rforbes)Whiteboard: [site:gpg.mozilla.org][reporter-external][verif?] → [site:gpg.mozilla.org][reporter-external] old IE only?

we're currently running the SKS keyserver version 1.1.4 (latest) and using the default page.
Thus, the issue most likely exist in the upstream SKS code indeed (<https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/>)
I did not find any public issue on the matter in their issue tracker (<https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/issues?q=xss> for example)

The output appears to be sanitized by the server, thus i believe there is no actual issue.
rforbes, can you confirm?Flags: needinfo?(rforbes)

I guess if the upstream bug is available in public we don't need to hide our version here.
