Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3207:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the SKS keyserver software. Specifically, it is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `pks/lookup/` endpoint of the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The server reflects unsanitized input from the URL in the response, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the page, leading to various potential impacts, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the path, specifically the part of the path after `/pks/lookup/`. For example: `http://gpg.mozilla.org//pks/lookup/undefined1<ScRiPt>prompt(972363)</ScRiPt>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker must trick a user into visiting the specially crafted URL or use other means to make the request.
- The attacker needs no access to the server.
- Old versions of Internet Explorer (IE) or command-line tools like `curl` do not automatically escape the request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a potential false positive but was later confirmed as a genuine reflected XSS issue.
- Modern browsers automatically escape the request and do not render the XSS, making it harder to exploit directly via modern browsers.
- The issue was present in the SKS keyserver version 1.1.4.
- The vulnerability was addressed in the upstream SKS project (version 1.1.5), and gpg.mozilla.org was subsequently upgraded.
- A CVE (CVE-2014-3207) was assigned by the upstream project.
- The vulnerability was classified as "sec-low" and was not considered for a bounty.
