Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Kernel Pool Overflow in Symantec Endpoint Protection Client's `sysplant` driver.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a specially crafted IOCTL code sent to the `sysplant` driver, which is part of the Application and Device Control functionality. This leads to a kernel pool overflow due to an access of a memory location after the end of a buffer.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer:** The core weakness is that the driver does not properly validate the size of the input buffer, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated memory.

**Impact:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged local attacker can elevate their privileges to SYSTEM level, gaining full control of the system.
*   **System Compromise:** By gaining SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can perform any action on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be logged into the target system as an unprivileged user.
*   **IOCTL Call:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted IOCTL code to the vulnerable `sysplant` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
*   **Basic Understanding of IOCTL:** Requires knowledge of sending specific IOCTL calls to device drivers.

**Additional details from the exploit code and analysis:**

*   The exploit code shows that the vulnerability occurs during a memory copy operation within the `sysplant` driver. By manipulating the `child_block` and `child_block_size` variables within `SYSFER.dll` using the `WriteProcessMemory`, an attacker can control the source buffer and size of the memory copy, leading to the overflow.
*   The code uses a kernel pool spray to allocate memory for the exploit.
*  The exploit overwrites the TypeIndex field in the header of the allocated buffer and then uses a token stealing shellcode to gain system privileges.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Symantec Endpoint Protection Client 11.x
*   Symantec Endpoint Protection Client 12.x

**Mitigation:**
*   **Patching:** Symantec released a patch (SEP 12.1.4112.4156) to address this vulnerability.
*   **Disabling the Driver:** As a workaround, disabling the `sysplant` driver through a registry edit and system reboot can prevent exploitation. Note: disabling via SEP client or policy will not prevent the driver from loading.

This information is more detailed than the original CVE description as it includes specifics about the vulnerable driver, the IOCTL code, the way to exploit it through the manipulation of the `SYSFER.dll` variables, the use of a token stealing shellcode, and how a kernel pool spray is leveraged for the exploit.
