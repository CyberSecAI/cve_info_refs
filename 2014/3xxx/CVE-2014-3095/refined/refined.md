Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IBM DB2 SQL engine. Specifically, a specially crafted `SELECT` statement containing a subquery with a `UNION` clause can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of specific SQL query structures by the DB2 SQL engine, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service, disrupting the normal functioning of the affected DB2 instance and any applications relying on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious user crafting a specific SQL query that includes a `SELECT` statement with a subquery containing a `UNION`. This query is then executed against the vulnerable DB2 instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable IBM DB2 database instance. This could be achieved through direct access to the database, through a vulnerable application that does not sanitize the user input before forwarding to the DB2, or any other means allowing execution of SQL commands.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse C3000, C4000, D5100
- IBM Smart Analytics System 1050, 2050, 5600, 5710, 7600, 7700, 7710
- IBM PureData System for Operational Analytics A1791
These products are affected when they use either IBM DB2 Version 9.7 or Version 10.1.

**Remediation:**
IBM provides specific APARs (Authorized Program Analysis Reports) and interim fixes for this vulnerability. Users need to contact IBM Support and reference the specific APAR (IT02645 for DB2 v9.7 and IT02646 for DB2 v10.1) to request a special build containing the fix.
