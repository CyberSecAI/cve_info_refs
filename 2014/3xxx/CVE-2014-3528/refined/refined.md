  "CVE-2014-3528": {
    "description": "Subversion's credentials cache uses an MD5 hash in order to index and then lookup cached credentials. MD5 is subject to hash collisions and as such it may be possible to engineer a server to get Subversion to send it credentials that have been cached for a different server. This can lead to the leaking of these credentials to a 3rd party.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Subversion's credential caching mechanism uses an MD5 hash of the server URL and authentication realm. Due to the possibility of hash collisions, a malicious server could cause a Subversion client to send it credentials cached for a different server."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious server could potentially obtain cached credentials intended for another server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious server must have a realm that produces the same MD5 hash as the target server.",
       "The attacker needs to trick the user to connect their Subversion client to their server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to generate a specific authentication realm that results in an MD5 hash collision with the target server's realm.",
     "Social engineering may be needed to trick a user into connecting their Subversion client to the malicious server."
    ],
      "root_cause": "The use of MD5 hashing for indexing cached credentials, which is vulnerable to collisions.",
    "additional_information": [
      "The vulnerability affects various storage methods used by Subversion for cached credentials including Windows Crypto API, KWallet, Gnome-Keyring, and OS X Keychain.",
         "Exploiting this vulnerability in practice will be very difficult because calculating such a collision with the current public known techniques for producing an MD5 collision (e.g chosen prefix attacks) requires control of the authentication realm on the real server the credentials are for."
