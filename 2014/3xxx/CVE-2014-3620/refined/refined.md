Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in libcurl's cookie handling logic. Specifically, libcurl incorrectly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect TLD Cookie Handling:** libcurl's cookie parser lacks proper validation to prevent setting cookies at the TLD level. This is a fundamental weakness in how cookies are parsed and applied.
*   **Lack of Public Suffix Awareness:** The advisory mentions that libcurl doesn't have "Public Suffix List" (PSL) awareness. While not the root cause, it is another important aspect of this issue. Without it, even after fixing TLD issue, curl will still be vulnerable to other similar issues related to cookie domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Cookie Leakage:** Exploiting this vulnerability allows a malicious site to set cookies for a TLD. These cookies would then be sent to *any* site under that TLD, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of information.
*   **Session Hijacking Potential:** If sensitive session cookies were leaked, attackers could potentially hijack user sessions on other websites within the same TLD.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Server:** A malicious actor could set up a web server that crafts HTTP responses with the intention of setting a cookie for a TLD.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker performing a MitM attack could inject HTTP headers into responses to force the client to set a cookie for a TLD.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Influence HTTP Response Headers:** Attackers must be able to control the HTTP response headers. This could be done by owning the server directly or by performing a MitM attack.
*   **No Special User Privileges:** The attack does not require any specific privileges on the target system or network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in libcurl version 7.31.0 and fixed in 7.38.0.
*   The vulnerability is described as having "High" severity by curl project.
*   The issue was reported to the curl project on August 15, 2014.
*   The fix was released on September 10, 2014.
*   The vulnerability is closely related to CVE-2014-3613 (also about cookie handling issues) but is distinct.

The content from Apple indicates that their OS X Yosemite v10.10 to v10.10.4 were also vulnerable and updated to a newer curl version (7.43.0). The Debian security advisory also confirms that the issue was addressed in their packages. openSUSE also released updates for their affected products.
