Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] curl: cookie for trailing dot TLD

cookie for trailing dot TLD
===========================

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 -
[Permalink](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27779.html>)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if
the host name is provided with a trailing dot.

curl can be told to receive and send cookies when communicating using
HTTP(S). curl's "cookie engine" can be built with or without [Public Suffix
List](<https://publicsuffix.org/>) awareness. If PSL support not provided, a
more rudimentary check exists to at least prevent cookies from being set on
TLDs. This check was broken if the host name in the URL uses a trailing dot.

This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a
different and unrelated site or domain.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This vulnerability only exists when curl is built without
[libpsl](<https://rockdaboot.github.io/libpsl/>). Without this PSL support
built-in, curl is also destined to possibly leak cookies cross sites simply
due to how public suffixes work.

This flaw was introduced in [commit
b27ad8e1d3e68e](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e>), shipped
in curl 7.82.0 when the treatment of trailing dot host names was changed.

This flaw is similar to
[CVE-2014-3620](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3620.html>), although in 2014
curl did not have PSL support.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-27779 to this issue.

CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.82.0 to and including curl 7.83.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.82.0 and curl >= 7.83.1

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

A [fix for CVE-2022-27779](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7e92d12b4e6911f>)

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.83.1

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Build libcurl with libpsl support

  D - Do not use cookies

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We contacted
distros@...nwall on May 5.

libcurl 7.83.1 was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

CREDITS
-------

This issue was reported by Axel Chong. Patched by Daniel Stenberg.

Thanks a lot!

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3613 CVE-2014-3620

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. They can be use to leak cookie information:

CVE-2014-3613

    By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP
    addresses properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can
    be fooled to both sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing
    arbitrary sites to set cookies for others.

CVE-2014-3620

    libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
    (TLDs), thus making them apply broader than cookies are allowed.
    This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get
    sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy10.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

## CVE-2014-3620

# cookie leak for TLDs

Project curl Security Advisory, September 10th 2014 [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3620.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
(TLDs), thus making them apply broader than cookies are allowed. This
can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a
different and unrelated site or domain.

## INFO

Cookie parsing and use is opt-in by applications and is not enabled
by default.

libcurl's cookie parser has no Public Suffix awareness, so apart from
rejecting TLDs from being allowed it might still allow cookies for
domains that are otherwise widely rejected by ordinary browsers. See <https://publicsuffix.org/> for
details.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2014-3620 to this issue.

CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

Severity: High

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: from libcurl [7.31.0](vuln-7.31.0.html) to and including [7.3[7.1](vuln-7.1.html)](vuln-7.37.1.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.31.0](vuln-7.31.0.html) and libcurl >=
  [7.38.0](vuln-7.38.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/85b9dc8023>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

libcurl [7.38.0](vuln-7.38.0.html) does not accept cookies set for just a TLD. Note that
it does not add any public suffix awareness apart from that.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/a76825a5efa6b41d3a1d4f275d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl [7.38.0](vuln-7.38.0.html)

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

C - Avoid using cookies in your application

## TIMELINE

It was reported to the curl project on August 15th 2014. We contacted
distros@openwall on September 1st.

libcurl [7.38.0](vuln-7.38.0.html) was released on September 10th 2014, coordinated with
the publication of this advisory.

Reverts [5de8d84](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5de8d84098db1bd24e7fffefbe14e81f2a05995a) (May 2014, shipped in 7.37.0) and the
follow-up changes done afterward.

Keep the dot in names for everything except the SNI to make curl behave
more similar to current browsers. This means 'name' and 'name.' send the
same SNI for different 'Host:' headers.

Updated test 1322 accordingly

Fixes [#8290](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/8290)
Reported-by: Charles Cazabon
Closes [#8320](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/8320)
