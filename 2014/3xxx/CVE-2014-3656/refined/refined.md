Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `origin` query parameter in the `login-status-iframe.html` endpoint of JBoss Keycloak. When a JBoss Keycloak application is configured to allow '\*' as a permitted web origin, it becomes vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize the `origin` query parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the HTML generated by the `login-status-iframe.html` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session interacting with the vulnerable Keycloak application.
*   **Potential for Account Hijacking:** Depending on the injected JavaScript code, an attacker could potentially perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user within the Keycloak application.
*   **Data theft/manipulation:** The attacker can steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `login-status-iframe.html` endpoint with a specially crafted `origin` query parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **User Interaction:**  An attacker might need to trick a user into visiting a malicious link that makes a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `login-status-iframe.html` endpoint and its use of the `origin` parameter.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be capable of crafting HTTP requests and manipulating URL parameters.
*   **Target Configuration:** The target Keycloak application must be configured to allow '\*' as a permitted web origin for the XSS vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes**

* The bug report mentions that this issue does not affect any supported Red Hat products.
* The vulnerability is triggered when the configuration uses '\*' as a permitted web origin.
