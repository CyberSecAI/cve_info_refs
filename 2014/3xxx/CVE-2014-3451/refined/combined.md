The Ignite Realtime community is very proud to release Openfire 3.10.0 for general availability from <http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/>

The amount of energy that has gone into this release is truly impressive, and it shows no signs of slowing down - as those of your looking at the 3.11 branch will have seen. Further 3.10.X releases will be bugfix releases; 3.11 will concentrate on a path to 4.0.0.

3.10.0 itself brings new core features to Openfire (such as Message Carbons, for example, by Christian Schudt) and vital improvements (to clustering and MUC, for example, by Tom Evans), as well as some hard bugfixing (by Guus der Kinderen) and important security improvements.

As ever, we welcome pull requests (to 3.10 or master as appropriate), and the entire development team is looking forward to you joining the conversation either in the forums or in the XMPP chatroom at open\_chat@conference.igniterealtime.org

Happy Chatting!

Dave.

**UPDATE:** Spark 2.6.3 version has issues with connecting to this version of Openfire. We suggest updating to just released 2.7.0 version of Spark.

**UPDATE 2:** Openfire 3.10.1 has been released recently, which is again compatible with Spark 2.6.3 when using TLS (thanks to this fix [OF-907] SSLv2 Hello is rejected; prevents some clients connecting - Jive Software Open Source )

Fantastic work guys!

In the OpenFire “build\lib\merge…” and “src\plugins…” subfolders, which version of tinder.jar is being imported?

The latest Tinder source ( v1.2.2 ) does not have asBareJID() implemented among a few other differences. Thanks for pointing me to the right place!

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Great job everyone. Been telling my team this was coming for months. They’ve grown weary of hearing me go on about it. Since I’ve been running 3.10.0 in dev since it was Alpha, the improvements it brings are by now well known.

Well, just make sure to check all these threads about 100-200-500% of CPU usage after the upgrade

Também tive o mesmo problema. As conexões saem pela porta 5269, mas não retornam.

Ainda não efetuei maiores testes. Caso tenha algum progresso, informo aqui.

3.10.0

170 user accounts. Up to ~50 active sessions works normal. 70 sessions and more eating all 8 CPU cores at 95% (of each core) and drop any user connections.

Yes. There were 3.10.1 and 3.10.2 releases not so long ago and 3.11.0 should be soon also.

Subject: Incorrect handling of self signed certificates in OpenFire XMPP Server

Incorrect handling of self signed certificates in OpenFire XMPP Server

Affected software: OpenFire XMPP server
Affected versions: 3.9.3 and earlier
Vulnerabilities addressed: CVE-2014-3451, CVE-2015-2080

Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. It uses the widely adopted open protocol for instant messaging, XMPP (also called Jabber).

Vulnerability details

The OpenFire server would incorrectly accept self signed certificates potentially allowing spoofing attacks.

This issue (CVE-2014-3451) is fixed in release 3.10 (OF-405).

We would like to thank Kim Alvefur for reporting this issue.

Notes on release

The 3.10 release of OpenFire also addresses a reflected XSS issue (OF-845), and upgrades the Jetty library used (addressing CVE-2015-2080).
