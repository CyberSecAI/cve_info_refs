  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2014-3461",
    "description": "Multiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flaws\nwere found in the way the virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, and usb drivers\nof QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alter the\nsavevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could\nuse either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the\n(destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code\nexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "QEMU USB driver"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The QEMU USB driver did not perform proper post-load checks when handling savevm data during migration. Specifically, when the state is DATA, passing an index greater than the length will cause memcpy with a negative length, which leads to a heap overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap overflow",
       "Improper input validation",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Altering savevm data on disk",
       "Altering savevm data over the wire during migration"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to alter the savevm data, either on disk or over the wire during migration."
