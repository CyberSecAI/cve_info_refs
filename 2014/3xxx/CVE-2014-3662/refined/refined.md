Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Jenkins handles login attempts. It allows anonymous users to test if a specific username exists on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is an information disclosure vulnerability. The system reveals whether a given username is valid or not, which should ideally be kept secret.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can enumerate valid usernames on the Jenkins instance. This information can be used as a part of a larger attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the login form or authentication mechanism of Jenkins. An unauthenticated user can make login attempts with various usernames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the Jenkins instance. No other special privileges or capabilities are required as the vulnerability is accessible anonymously.

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-3662 allows an unauthenticated user to probe Jenkins for valid usernames by making login attempts and observing the system's response. This can lead to information disclosure, aiding further attacks.
