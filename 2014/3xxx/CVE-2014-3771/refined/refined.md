Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when setting the user language in `index.php` and `sources/main.queries.php`. Specifically, the language is passed via a POST variable without sufficient sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject a path into the language parameter to load arbitrary PHP files, bypassing intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Injection:** The application fails to validate the user-provided language parameter, enabling an attacker to manipulate the path used to load language files. This leads to the inclusion of arbitrary PHP files.
*   **File Execution Protection Bypass:** The application employs a session variable `CPM` to protect certain PHP files from direct access. The path injection vulnerability bypasses this protection, allowing unauthorized access and execution of protected files.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The use of `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` is not adequate to prevent path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP files on the server by manipulating the language parameter.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Admin Settings:** The vulnerability enables unauthenticated users to render and modify administrator settings, potentially changing LDAP configurations, login text for XSS attacks, and filesystem paths. This could lead to account takeover and other severe attacks.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious PHP files through the upload functionality (after bypassing access controls via this vulnerability), attackers can achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Login Bypass:** An attacker could modify settings in the system to gain access to admin functionality

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users by sending crafted POST requests to `index.php` or `sources/main.queries.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests.
*   Knowledge of the application's file structure helps, but it is not necessary to inject code

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided commit `fd549b245c0f639a8d47bf4f74f92c37c053706f` on GitHub is referenced as a fix for this issue and also addresses XSS issues (CVE-2014-3774).
* The vulnerability allows for a wide range of attacks, including but not limited to privilege escalation, remote code execution, and data exfiltration.
* The fix for this issue requires proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the language parameter, and correct implementation of access controls.
