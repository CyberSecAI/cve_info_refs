Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3204:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the Unity desktop environment's failure to properly filter keyboard shortcuts while the screen is locked. This allowed certain keyboard combinations and actions to bypass the lock screen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Keyboard Shortcut Filtering:** Unity did not effectively disable or filter keyboard shortcuts when the screen was locked.
*   **Bypassing Lock Screen:** The vulnerability allowed a local attacker to bypass the lock screen by exploiting the unfiltered keyboard shortcuts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on behalf of the logged-in user.
*   **Session Unlocking:** By running commands, the attacker could potentially unlock the current user session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires physical access to the system.
*   **Keyboard Input:** The attacker utilizes unfiltered keyboard shortcuts to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Right-click on the indicator bar:** The attacker right-clicks on the indicator bar multiple times

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Presence:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine with the locked screen.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Ubuntu:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to use keyboard shortcuts within Ubuntu.
*   **Ability to Trigger the Bug:** The attacker needs to be able to perform the right-click action on the indicator bar to trigger the vulnerability and execute shortcuts, such as `ALT+F2`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Frédéric Bardy.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Unity version 7.2.0+14.04.20140423-0ubuntu1.1.
*   The fix involves changes to `lockscreen/LockScreenController.cpp`, `lockscreen/LockScreenShield.*`, and `plugins/unityshell/src/unityshell.*`.
*   The fix addresses the broader issue by toggling the activation of all the Unity compiz actions when the screen is locked and ensuring the lock screen views are always on top.
*   A user reported that the fix wasn't completely effective and was still able to bypass the lock screen with the same methodology, but this was reported as a new bug.

This vulnerability falls under the category of a local privilege escalation due to the ability to bypass security controls.
