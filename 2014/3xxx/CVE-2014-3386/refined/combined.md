CWE-16,CWE-20,CWE-287,CWE-362,CWE-399,CWE-78    Email      Summary  * **2015-July-08 UPDATE:** Cisco PSIRT is aware of disruption to some   Cisco customers with Cisco ASA devices affected by CVE-2014-3383, the   Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability that was disclosed in this   Security Advisory. Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a   specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner   of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no   malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a   fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue.  Affected Products  * Cisco ASA Software running on the following products is affected by multiple vulnerabilities:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)Affected releases of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.   Vulnerable Products**Cisco ASA SQL\*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SQL\*Net inspection is enabled.      To determine whether SQL\*Net inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include sqlnet** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SQL\*Net inspection enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sqlnet   Inspect: sqlnet, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0      ``` **Note:** SQL\*Net inspection is enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate IKEv1 and IKEv2 VPN connections. This includes LAN-to-LAN, Remote Access VPN both via the IPSec VPN client and IKEv2 AnyConnect VPN, and L2TP over IPSec VPN connections. Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPNs are not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine if the Cisco ASA is configured to terminate IKEv1 or IKEv2 VPN connections, a crypto map should be configured for at least one interface. Administrators should use the **show running-config crypto map | include interface** command and verify that it returns output. The following example shows a crypto map called *cmap* configured on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface   crypto map outside_map interface outside      ``` **Note:** IKEv1 or IKEv2 VPN are not configured by default.      **Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate IKEv2 VPN connections. This includes LAN-to-LAN IKEv2 and AnyConnect IKEv2 VPN connections. To determine whether IKEv2 VPN is enabled use the **show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable** command and verify that the command returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with IKEv2 VPN enabled on the interface *outside*: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable   crypto ikev2 enable outside      ``` In addition to having IKEv2 enabled, the Cisco ASA needs to have a crypto map configured on the interface where IKEv2 is enabled. This can be determined by using the **show running-config crypto map | include interface** command and verifying that it returns output. The following example shows a crypto map called *cmap* configured on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface   crypto map outside_map interface outside      ``` **Note:** IKEv2 VPN is not enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if health and performance monitoring (HPM) for ASDM is enabled.      To determine whether HPM is enabled, use the **show running-config | include hpm** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with the HPM feature enabled:    ```   ciscoasa# show running-config | include hpm   ciscoasa# hpm topn enable      ``` **Note:** HPM is not enabled by default.       **Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) inspection is enabled.      To determine whether GTP inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include gtp** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with GTP inspection enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include gtp   Inspect: gtp, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0      ``` **Note:** GTP inspection is not enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SunRPC inspection is enabled.      To determine whether SunRPC inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include sunrpc** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SunRPC inspection enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc   Inspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0      ``` **Note:** SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if DNS inspection is enabled.      To determine whether DNS inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include dns** command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DNS inspection enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include dns   Inspect: dns preset_dns_map, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, v6-fail-close 0      ``` **Note:** DNS inspection is enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate any type of VPN connections, except Clientless SSL VPN, and it is configured in high availability (HA) mode (also known as failover mode).      Administrators can use the **show running-config crypto map | include interface** command to verify if any type of IKEv1 or IKEv2 IPSec VPNs are configured on the system and the **show running-config webvpn | include anyconnect** command to verify if AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with both IPSec and AnyConnect SSL VPNs configured: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn | include anyconnect enable    anyconnect enable   ciscoasa# show run crypto map | include interface    crypto map outside_map interface outside      ``` Administrators can use the **show failover** command and verify that the failover is *ON* to determine if high availability mode is configured. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with high availability mode enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show failover   Failover On   [...]      ``` **Note:** This vulnerability affects only HA configurations that do not use a failover key to protect failover traffic. HA and VPN are not enabled by default.       **Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability**      All Cisco ASA running an affected version of software are affected by this vulnerability.      **Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability**      All Cisco ASA running an affected version of software are affected by this vulnerability.       **Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled. To determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled use the **show running-config webvpn** command and verify that webvpn is enabled on at least one interface. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn    webvpn    enable outside    [...]      ``` **Note:** The Clientless SSL VPN portal is not enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the following conditions are met:   1. Clientless SSL VPN portal functionality is enabled   2. A default customization object or a newly created customization object for Clientless SSL VPN portal has to be previewed in ASDMTo determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled use the **show running-config webvpn** command and verify that webvpn is enabled at least on one interface. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn    webvpn    enable outside    [...]      ``` There is no method to determine if a preview of a customization object has been done. The following method is used to preview a customization object. In ASDM navigate to **CLIENTLESS SSL VPN ACCESS -> PORTAL -> CUSTOMIZATION -> PREVIEW**.       **Additional Indicator of Compromise for** **Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability**   Customers running a vulnerable configuration should verify that the portal customization has not been compromised. Customers can verify that the portal has not been compromised by exporting the customization objects and manually verifying that the objects do not include malicious code.      The new custom object and default customization object (DfltCustomization) should be analyzed. To export an SSL VPN portal customization object, use the **export webvpn customization**   command, where the  is the name of the SSL VPN portal customization object being exported and  is the name of the file that will include a copy of the customization object.      The following example shows how to export the default customization object *DfltCustomization* to a file called *Customization\_to\_verify*    ```   ciscoasa# export webvpn customization DfltCustomization Customization_to_verify   ``` The *Customization\_to\_verify* file is stored on the device disk and can be exported for further analysis.      Customers should repeat this process for all of the customization objects that are present on the system.  **Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Smart Call Home (SCH) feature is configured or has been configured on the system. When the feature is configured, a digital certificate trustpoint called *\_SmartCallHome\_ServerCA* is automatically installed on the system. To determine whether this trustpoint is installed, use the **show running-config crypto ca trustpoint \_SmartCallHome\_ServerCA** command and verify that it returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with this trustpoint installed: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA   crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA    crl configure      ``` **Note:** The presence of this trustpoint would make the system vulnerable; however, this vulnerability cannot be exploited unless there is another feature configured that relies on digital certificates validation services. Examples of these features are digital certificate authentication for VPN or ASDM connections or TLS-Proxy and Phone-proxy. SCH is not enabled by default.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, and the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv).

This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCun10916](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun10916) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-3394.  Workarounds  * For the following vulnerabilities there is no workaround except disabling the affected feature:   + Cisco ASA SQL\*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability   + Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability**Note:** For the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability, removing the SCH configuration will not remove the trustpoint. In order to eliminate the trustpoint, the administrator should use the **no crypto ca trustpoint**  command. The following example shows how to remove the trustpoint enabled by the SCH feature. Removing this trustpoint will cause SCH to stop working correctly. ```   ciscoasa(config)# no crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA      ``` For the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, configuring a failover key would provide a workaround for this issue. To configure a failover key, use the **failover key**  command. The following example shows how to configure a failover key named *cisco-key*: ```   ciscoasa(config)#failover key cisco-key      ``` **Note:** The use of the **failover ipsec** command will not provide a workaround to this issue.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       Each row of the following Cisco ASA Software table lists the first fixed release for each of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory for each Cisco ASA major release.

While upgrading to a fixed version of Cisco ASA Software prevents this vulnerability from being exploited further, it will not modify any customization objects that have already been compromised and are present on the system. If an attacker has already compromised a customization object, the compromised object will stay persistent after the upgrade.      To verify whether a customization object has been compromised, follow the instruction in "Additional Indicator of Compromise for Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability" that are included in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory.      The following method can be used to restore the default customization object (*DfltCustomization*):   1. Export the default template to a file. The following example shows how to export the default template to a file called *default\_template*    ```   ciscoasa# export webvpn customization Template default_template   ``` 3. Import the default template as default customization object (*DfltCustomization*): ```   ciscoasa# import webvpn customization DfltCustomization default_template   ``` **Note:** This will override any changes done to the default customization object (*DfltCustomization*). It is not possible to remove the default customization object (*DfltCustomization*) from the system.      The **import webvpn customization** command can also be used to restore non-default customization objects after these have been manually edited and verified. It is possible to remove any non-default customization object by using ASDM and navigating to **CLIENTLESS SSL VPN ACCESS -> PORTAL -> CUSTOMIZATION**. In the CUSTOMIZATION panel, select the non-default customization objects and click on **Delete**.Software DownloadCisco ASA Software can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com by visiting <http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html>      For Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall navigate to **Products   > Security > Firewalls > Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA)   > Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances >  > Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software**.
