Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3065:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to an unspecified flaw in the IBM Java Runtime Environment (JRE) related to the shared classes cache. This flaw allows local users to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in the following versions:
- JRE 7 R1 before SR2 (7.1.2.0)
- JRE 7 before SR8 (7.0.8.0)
- JRE 6 R1 before SR8 FP2 (6.1.8.2)
- JRE 6 before SR16 FP2 (6.0.16.2)
- JRE before SR16 FP8 (5.0.16.8)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The vulnerability allows for local privilege escalation through the shared classes cache mechanism. The exact nature of the flaw is unspecified, but it enables the injection of arbitrary code into the shared classes cache.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exploitation could result in local users gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code, possibly with the privileges of other users that use IBM JDK, leading to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system. The vulnerability is triggered through the shared classes cache mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker requires local access to the system and must be a user who can execute code that interacts with the IBM JRE.

**Additional details:**

- Several sources mention that the fix involves updating the IBM Java Runtime Environment to address this vulnerability, disabling SSLv3 to address CVE-2014-3566, and providing fixes for multiple Oracle Java vulnerabilities within the same updates.
- Several SUSE security updates and Red Hat Security Advisories address this issue, listing the affected products and package versions.
- Some sources include links to IBM's security alerts and other resources providing more details about the flaw.
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry for CVE-2014-3065 (Bug 1162554) confirms that the vulnerability is a privilege escalation via shared class cache and lists various Red Hat Product errata that address it. It also mentions that this issue has been addressed in the Red Hat Satellite Server via RHSA-2015:0264
