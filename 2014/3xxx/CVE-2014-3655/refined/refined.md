Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The JBoss KeyCloak soft token removal endpoint was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application did not properly validate the origin of the request to remove soft tokens, allowing an attacker to forge a request on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker could remove a user's soft token if the user visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker while being authenticated with KeyCloak. This can prevent the user from authenticating using soft token or could cause other issues with the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, as the attacker provides a malicious web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious website for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted web page.
*   The attacker does not need access to the user's KeyCloak account itself, but only that the user has an active session.
