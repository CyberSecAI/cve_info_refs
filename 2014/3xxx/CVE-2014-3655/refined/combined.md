We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

### Severity

 Recommended 0.0low010

CVSS assessment made by Snyk's Security Team. [Learn more](/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGKEYCLOAK-30138#cvss)

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

#### Introduced: 25 Dec 2016

[CVE-2014-3655  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-3655) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-352  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## Overview

[`org.keycloak:keycloak-services`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22keycloak-services%22)
It was discovered that JBoss KeyCloak's soft token removal endpoint was vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when visited by a user authenticated by KeyCloak, could allow the attacker to remove a soft token registerd to the user.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

3.7 low

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144817#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-21 10:37:35 UTC  ``` It was discovered that JBoss KeyCloak's soft token removal endpoint was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when visited by a user authenticated by KeyCloak, could allow the attacker to remove a soft token registerd to the user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1144817#c1)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-21 10:41:06 UTC  ``` Upstream Issue:  <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-705>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1144817#c2)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-21 10:41:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1144817#c3)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-09-21 10:52:54 UTC  ``` Victims Record:  <https://github.com/victims/victims-cve-db/blob/master/database/java/2014/3655.yaml>   ``` |  |
