   - Mentions of mkgmtime() function and ISO 8601 date format in the PHP changelog and PHP bug tracker.
   - Explicit mention of `An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc extension parsed dates in the ISO 8601 format` in the description of the vulnerability from Red Hat bugzilla.
    
**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `mkgmtime()` function within the `xmlrpc` extension when parsing dates in ISO 8601 format. The root cause of the issue lies within the improper calculation of the month (`tm->tm_mon`) value where a check is being performed on `text[i]` while using `text[i+4]` to compute the value. This leads to an out-of-bounds read from the text buffer and potential use of an out-of-range value in an array lookup.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `xmlrpc` extension's `mkgmtime()` function.
    *   Improper bounds check on array access.
    *   Incorrect calculation of month value while parsing dates in ISO 8601 format.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A specially crafted XML-RPC request or response could lead to a crash of the PHP application due to the out-of-bounds read and dereference. This results in a denial-of-service condition.
    *   Heap out-of-bounds read.
    *   Global out of bounds read.
  
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote attacker**: An attacker could send a specially crafted XML-RPC request or response containing a malicious ISO 8601 formatted date string to a vulnerable PHP application.
    *   **Specially crafted input:** The specific vulnerability is triggered during parsing of a specially crafted ISO 8601 formatted date string within the `xmlrpc` extension.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send or inject data, specifically a malicious XML-RPC request or response, to a PHP application that uses the affected `xmlrpc` extension for parsing.
    *   No authentication is needed by the attacker to trigger this vulnerability as stated in the severity assessment: "Remote exploit without auth?".

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in how the `mkgmtime()` function (used for converting date and time strings) handles the month component when processing ISO 8601 formatted dates.
*   The issue can be triggered either by sending specially crafted requests to applications which process XML-RPC data.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in upstream PHP versions 5.4.34, 5.5.18, and 5.6.2 (as stated in Red Hat Bugzilla and the PHP changelog).

**4. Summary of Impact:**

The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially crash a PHP application processing XML-RPC data by sending a malicious crafted ISO 8601 formatted date string, leading to a denial-of-service.

**5. Additional Information (beyond CVE description):**

* The provided data indicates that the vulnerability affects not only the php package but also related extensions such as xmlrpc.
* The openSUSE mailing list also includes CVE-2014-3669 and CVE-2014-3670 in the same security update announcement, suggesting these vulnerabilities may be present in similar code or attack vectors.
* The Red Hat bugzilla entry provides a link to the upstream PHP commit fixing this issue: `<http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=88412772d295ebf7dd34409534507dc9bcac726e>`.
* The fix addresses the improper array access and input validation issues in the `mkgmtime()` function.
* The `libxmlrpc` library code within PHP's `xmlrpc` extension is where the vulnerability occurs.
* Patches for this issue are applied to PHP versions 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6.
* The vulnerability can also be triggered by sending a specially crafted XML document to be parsed by the `xmlrpc_decode` function.
