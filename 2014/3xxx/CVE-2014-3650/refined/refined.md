Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the JBoss AeroGear application. Specifically, the `deviceToken` and other user account fields (Email, Last Name, First Name) were vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application was vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks. Malicious scripts could be injected into the database via user-supplied fields, which would then be executed when the compromised data was displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Compromise:** A successful XSS injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens)
    - Modification of displayed content
    - Execution of arbitrary REST calls, potentially leading to full compromise of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the `deviceToken` field or other vulnerable user account fields in a request. The malicious input was stored and later rendered to a victim using the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit requests to the application. They do not need to have administrative rights.
- The attacker does not require any special position within the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the vulnerable fields by including malicious Javascript.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in multiple user-supplied fields.
- The XSS payload could be triggered simply by viewing a page containing the malicious entry.
- The issue was present in the Aerogear component of JBoss.
