# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Two vulnerabilities in the metadata flow feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reload a vulnerable device.
The vulnerabilities are due to improper handling of transit RSVP packets that need to be processed by the metadata infrastructure. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malformed RSVP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an extended denial of service (DoS) condition.
Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-metadata["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-metadata"]
Note: The September 24, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html"]

Devices configured to use the metadata flow feature are affected by these vulnerabilities. To determine whether metadata flow has been configured on an IOS device, the administrator can use the show running | include metadata command. Affected devices will include the metadata flow command. There are two variations of the command, one for global configuration mode and another for interface configuration mode. Either variation of the command causes the device to be vulnerable.
The following example shows a device on which the metadata feature is active:
Router# show running | include metadata
metadata flow
Router#
To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].

The following products have been confirmed not to be vulnerable to the vulnerabilities described in this document:
Cisco NX-OS Software
Cisco IOS XR Software
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
The metadata infrastructure provides a framework that allows data from network flows seen on a network element to be available to another component on the same network element and across network elements. Flow metadata is the data that describes a flow in the network. Flows such as RSVP flows are inspected for signaling to store their attributes in a database, referred to as the control plane database.
The vulnerabilities in this document are related to the processing of certain RSVP flows by the metadata feature when their metadata is going to be stored in the control database. The RSVP flows that cause the vulnerabilities are not destined to the vulnerable device, but are transit traffic as seen by the vulnerable device.
Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain two vulnerabilities when configured with the metadata flow feature. These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device reload. These vulnerabilities could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.
A device is vulnerable if it is configured with the metadata flow feature. An attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending certain malformed RSVP packets on IP protocol 46 and IP protocol 134. No UDP or TCP ports are affected by these vulnerabilities.
Starting with the integration of metadata flow over IPv6 in 15.3(1)T, the vulnerabilities can also be exploited via IPv6 (See Cisco bug ID CSCtw57401). To determine whether a vulnerable device supports the metadata over IPv6 feature, use the show metadata flow table ipv6
exec command. A device that supports metadata over IPv6 will produce the following output:
Router> show metadata flow table ipv6
To From
Flow Proto DPort SPort Ingress Egress
Router>
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to reload a vulnerable device.
Workarounds are not available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities have been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue22753["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue22753"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCug75942["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug75942"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and have been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2014-3356 and CVE-2014-3355, respectively.
No workarounds are available.
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Metadata Vulnerabilities High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20140924-metadata  First Published: 2014 September 24 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCue22753](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue22753)  [CSCug75942](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug75942)     CVE-2014-3355 CVE-2014-3356     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-3355 CVE-2014-3356     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-metadata/oval/cisco-sa-20140924-metadata_521.xml)   Email      Summary  * Two vulnerabilities in the metadata flow feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reload a vulnerable device.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsDevices configured to use the metadata flow feature are affected by these vulnerabilities. To determine whether metadata flow has been configured on an IOS device, the administrator can use the **show running | include metadata** command. Affected devices will include the **metadata flow** command. There are two variations of the command, one for global configuration mode and another for interface configuration mode. Either variation of the command causes the device to be vulnerable.      The following example shows a device on which the metadata feature is active: ```   Router# show running | include metadata    metadata flow   Router#      ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products have been confirmed not to be vulnerable to the vulnerabilities described in this document:   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco IOS XR SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The metadata infrastructure provides a framework that allows data from network flows seen on a network element to be available to another component on the same network element and across network elements. Flow metadata is the data that describes a flow in the network. Flows such as RSVP flows are inspected for signaling to store their attributes in a database, referred to as the control plane database.       The vulnerabilities in this document are related to the processing of certain RSVP flows by the metadata feature when their metadata is going to be stored in the control database. The RSVP flows that cause the vulnerabilities are not destined to the vulnerable device, but are transit traffic as seen by the vulnerable device.      Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain two vulnerabilities when configured with the metadata flow feature. These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device reload. These vulnerabilities could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.      A device is vulnerable if it is configured with the metadata flow feature. An attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending certain malformed RSVP packets on IP protocol 46 and IP protocol 134. No UDP or TCP ports are affected by these vulnerabilities.       Starting with the integration of metadata flow over IPv6 in 15.3(1)T, the vulnerabilities can also be exploited via IPv6 (See Cisco bug ID CSCtw57401). To determine whether a vulnerable device supports the metadata over IPv6 feature, use the **show metadata flow table ipv6** exec command. A device that supports metadata over IPv6 will produce the following output: ```   Router> show metadata flow table ipv6    To                                      From   Flow  Proto DPort SPort Ingress      Egress      Router>      ``` Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to reload a vulnerable device.      Workarounds are not available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.      These vulnerabilities have been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue22753](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue22753) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCug75942](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug75942) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2014-3356 and CVE-2014-3355, respectively.  Workarounds  * No workarounds are available.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.         Cisco IOS Software Cisco has provided a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the September 2015 bundled publication The tool will identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool will also return the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or simply enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether it is affected by any of the advisories in this bundled publication.
