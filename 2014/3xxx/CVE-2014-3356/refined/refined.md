Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3356:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of transit RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) packets that need to be processed by the metadata infrastructure in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Two distinct vulnerabilities exist in the metadata flow feature.
-  The vulnerabilities are triggered by malformed RSVP packets.
-  The vulnerability lies in the processing of RSVP flows when their metadata is stored in the control database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a device reload, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Repeated exploitation can result in an extended DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending malformed RSVP packets on IP protocol 46 and IP protocol 134.
- Starting with the integration of metadata flow over IPv6, the vulnerabilities can also be exploited via IPv6.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malformed RSVP packets to a vulnerable device.
-  Some knowledge of the affected infrastructure would aid in exploitation.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The metadata flow feature is a framework that allows data from network flows seen on a network element to be available to another component on the same network element or across network elements.
- The vulnerability is triggered by transit traffic RSVP flows not destined to the vulnerable device itself.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities are identified by Cisco bug IDs CSCue22753 and CSCug75942 (the latter is associated with CVE-2014-3355).
- A device is vulnerable if configured with the `metadata flow` command either in global or interface configuration mode.
- The `show metadata flow table ipv6` command can be used to identify if a device supports metadata over IPv6, which could be another attack vector
-The advisory provides a list of affected and fixed IOS and IOS XE software versions.
