Message-ID: <20141009190907.GC29399@w1.fi>

Subject: wpa_cli and hostapd_cli action script execution vulnerability

Published: October 9, 2014
Identifier: CVE-2014-3686
Latest version available from: <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/>

Vulnerability

A vulnerability was found in the mechanism wpa_cli and hostapd_cli use
for executing action scripts. An unsanitized string received from a
remote device can be passed to a system() call resulting in arbitrary
command execution under the privileges of the wpa_cli/hostapd_cli
process (which may be root or at least network admin in common use
cases).

Vulnerable versions/configurations

wpa_cli is a component distributed with wpa_supplicant and hostapd_cli
is a component distributed with hostapd. The vulnerability affects only
cases where wpa_cli or hostapd_cli is used to run action scripts (-a
command line option) and one (or more) of the following build
combinations for wpa_supplicant/hostapd is used:

wpa_supplicant v1.0-v2.2 with CONFIG_P2P build option enabled and
connecting to a P2P group

wpa_supplicant v2.1-v2.2 with CONFIG_WNM build option enabled

wpa_supplicant v2.2 with CONFIG_HS20 build option enabled

wpa_supplicant v0.7.2-v2.2 with CONFIG_WPS build option enabled and
operating as WPS Registrar

hostapd v0.7.2-v2.2 with CONFIG_WPS build option enabled and WPS enabled
in runtime configuration

wpa_supplicant and hostapd processes are not directly affected, i.e.,
the vulnerability occurs in the wpa_cli/hostapd process based on
information received from wpa_supplicant/hostapd.

Attacker (or a system controlled by the attacker) needs to be within
radio range of the vulnerable system to send a frame that triggers a
suitable formatted event message to allow full control on command
execution.

Possible mitigation steps

- Update to wpa_cli/hostapd_cli from wpa_supplicant/hostapd v2.3

- Merge the following commits to an older version of wpa_cli/hostapd_cli
  and rebuild it:

  Add os_exec() helper to run external programs
  wpa_cli: Use os_exec() for action script execution
  hostapd_cli: Use more robust mechanism for action script execution

  These patches are available from <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/>

- Disable use of wpa_cli/hostapd_cli command to run action scripts
  (this may prevent functionality)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14262#c0)  David Walser    2014-10-09 23:11:35 CEST  ``` A security issue has been announced today (October 9): <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/09/28> <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/wpacli-action-scripts.txt>  The issue is fixed upstream in version 2.3.  I've commited it in Cauldron SVN and requested a freeze push.  There are also patches available here: <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/>  Our hostapd package isn't currently vulnerable as WPS isn't enabled, but someone could have an issue if they enabled it and rebuilt it themselves.  Our wpa_supplicant package does have it enabled and is vulnerable.  Mageia 3 and Mageia 4 are affected.  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2014-10-09 23:11:41 CEST   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA3TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14262#c1)  David Walser    2014-10-09 23:34:16 CEST  ``` Patches checked into Mageia 3 and Mageia 4 SVN. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14262#c2)  David Walser    2014-10-09 23:56:21 CEST  ``` Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4.  Advisory: ========================  Updated wpa_supplicant and hostapd packages fix security vulnerability:  A vulnerability was found in the mechanism wpa_cli and hostapd_cli use for executing action scripts. An unsanitized string received from a remote device can be passed to a system() call resulting in arbitrary command execution under the privileges of the wpa_cli/hostapd_cli process (which may be root in common use cases) (CVE-2014-3686).  Using the Mageia wpa_supplicant package, systems are exposed to the vulnerability if operating as a WPS registrar.  The Mageia hostapd package was not vulnerable with the configuration with which it was built, but if a sysadmin had rebuilt it with WPS enabled, it would be vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-10 00:49:51 UTC  ``` Jouni Malinen discovered that a string supplied from a remote device could be supplied to a system() call in wpa_cli or hostapd_cli when running an action script (with the "-a" option), resulting in arbitrary command execution. This issue could also be triggered by an attacker within radio range.  Patches are available from the following:  <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/>  Based on the information about affected configurations in the upstream advisory, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is likely to be not vulnerable, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are likely to be vulnerable.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Jouni Malinen for reporting this issue.

There's a bug open for epel7 already, but that's for the 'hostapd' side of things which we dont' ship in RHEL7.  We *do* ship wpa_supplicant in RHEL7 and I believe that it also requires a patch.  If it is a problem for RHEL7's wpa_supplicant, could you create a security bug for EL7 so I can update the package there too?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-28 02:52:09 UTC  ``` RHEL 6 and 7 are affected.

The version of wpa_supplicant in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is 2.0 and is built with both CONFIG_WPS and CONFIG_P2P.

It only executes action script with two possible values for the second argument - "CONNECTED" or "DISCONNECTED".  A possibility to execute action script with different second argument seems to be first introduced in the following commit:  <http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=42f0101b>  This was first included in wpa_supplicant version 1.0.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-28 12:06:11 UTC  ``` Upstream confirmed wpa_supplicant versions prior to 1.0 are not affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-10 00:49:51 UTC  ``` Jouni Malinen discovered that a string supplied from a remote device could be supplied to a system() call in wpa_cli or hostapd_cli when running an action script (with the "-a" option), resulting in arbitrary command execution. This issue could also be triggered by an attacker within radio range.  Patches are available from the following:  <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/>  Based on the information about affected configurations in the upstream advisory, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is likely to be not vulnerable, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are likely to be vulnerable.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Jouni Malinen for reporting this issue.

There's a bug open for epel7 already, but that's for the 'hostapd' side of things which we dont' ship in RHEL7.  We *do* ship wpa_supplicant in RHEL7 and I believe that it also requires a patch.  If it is a problem for RHEL7's wpa_supplicant, could you create a security bug for EL7 so I can update the package there too?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-28 02:52:09 UTC  ``` RHEL 6 and 7 are affected.

The version of wpa_supplicant in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is 2.0 and is built with both CONFIG_WPS and CONFIG_P2P.  There is no application in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that executes wpa_cli in a vulnerable way.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-28 10:23:04 UTC  ``` After the further look at the 0.7.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, I do not believe that version is affected.  It only executes action script with two possible values for the second argument - "CONNECTED" or "DISCONNECTED".  A possibility to execute action script with different second argument seems to be first introduced in the following commit:  <http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=42f0101b>  This was first included in wpa_supplicant version 1.0.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-28 12:06:11 UTC  ``` Upstream confirmed wpa_supplicant versions prior to 1.0 are not affected.  Upstream advisory now includes the following update:    <http://w1.fi/security/2014-1/wpacli-action-scripts.txt>    October 28, 2014   - Removed "wpa_supplicant v0.7.2-v2.2 with CONFIG_WPS build option     enabled and operating as WPS Registrar" as a vulnerable combination     since wpa_cli actually filters out the potentially problematic event     string from wpa_supplicant while hostapd_cli does not.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1151259#c14)  Fedora Update System    2014-10-29 11:05:31 UTC  ``` wpa_supplicant-2.0-12.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

## Updated wpa\_supplicant and hostapd packages fix security vulnerability

Publication date: 28 Oct 2014

Modification date: 28 Oct 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-3686](CVE-2014-3686.html)

## Description

```
A vulnerability was found in the mechanism wpa_cli and hostapd_cli use
for executing action scripts. An unsanitized string received from a
remote device can be passed to a system() call resulting in arbitrary
command execution under the privileges of the wpa_cli/hostapd_cli
process (which may be root in common use cases) (CVE-2014-3686).

Using the Mageia wpa_supplicant package, systems are exposed to the
vulnerability if operating as a WPS registrar.

The Mageia hostapd package was not vulnerable with the configuration with
which it was built, but if a sysadmin had rebuilt it with WPS enabled, it
would be vulnerable.

```

## Synopsis

Moderate: wpa\_supplicant security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1956)

## Topic

An updated wpa\_supplicant package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The wpa\_supplicant package contains an 802.1X Supplicant with support for
WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication
methods. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client
stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and
association of the WLAN driver.

A command injection flaw was found in the way the wpa\_cli utility executed
action scripts. If wpa\_cli was run in daemon mode to execute an action
script (specified using the -a command line option), and wpa\_supplicant was
configured to connect to a P2P group, malicious P2P group parameters could
cause wpa\_cli to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3686)

Red Hat would like to thank Jouni Malinen for reporting this issue.

All wpa\_supplicant users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
