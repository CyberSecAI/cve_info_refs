Use CVE-2014-3981 for this issue in PHP.

We probably can't make a CVE assignment for this because the primary
affected product is unknown, and this /tmp/ffiYFc1nZ observation might
already be covered by a previous CVE. Lynis apparently runs many other
scripts and programs; for example, there are hundreds of

  FIND=`

lines.

We can make a CVE assignment corresponding to your disclosure of this
lynis.$$ issue on oss-security. Use CVE-2014-3982. A CVE for this most
likely won't (or shouldn't) have a
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21> reference unless the
original fulldisclosure author confirms the association.

We have heard from the original fulldisclosure author, and have
permission to continue with the public CVE assignments here. The new
status is that CVE-2014-3982 refers only to the above unsafe use of
/tmp/lynis.$$ on AIX. It's quite possible that Linux distributions
won't produce any security updates mapping to CVE-2014-3982.

A second CVE ID, CVE-2014-3986, refers to this separate vulnerability
on non-AIX platforms (i.e., any uname except for AIX):

  TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/lynis.XXXXXX`
  ...
  find ${I} -name "*.conf" -print >> ${TMPFILE}.unsorted

This apparently allows a straightforward symlink attack against the
${TMPFILE}.unsorted file. Credit for this discovery belongs to the
same author as in the <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21>
post.

(There are two CVE IDs because the provenance of the first full public
disclosure is not the same, and because the scope of CVE-2014-3982 had
already been defined.)

Message-ID: <53902152.2030506@redhat.com>
Date: Thu, 05 Jun 2014 17:50:42 +1000
From: Murray McAllister <mmcallis@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: PHP configure script and Lynis tool /tmp/ issues reported
 on full disclosure

Good morning,

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21> reports two temporary
file issues.

The first is in PHP's configure script:

char *filename = "/tmp/phpglibccheck";

(Red Hat bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1104978>)

The second issue is Lynis writing a predictable file to /tmp/. Looking
at the source I cannot tell which file that is, but 2 runs on Fedora 20
revealed the following file being used each time:

/tmp/ffiYFc1nZ

I cannot find that in the source. I do not know if lynsis exec()'s any
other scripts or programs. The full disclosure report might be referring
to the following in include/tests_webservers:

  39     if [ "${OS}" = "AIX" ]; then
  40         TMPFILE=/tmp/lynis.$$

Thanks,

--
Murray McAllister / Red Hat Security Response Team
