{
  "CVE-2014-3602": {
    "description": "OpenShift fails to restrict access to /proc/net/tcp which allows local users to view all listening connections and connected sockets. This can result in remote systems IP/port numbers in use being exposed which may be useful for further targeted attacks.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because OpenShift Enterprise did not restrict access to the `/proc/net/tcp` file in gears.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Disclosure",
        "Inadequate Access Control"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users within a gear can view all listening connections and connected sockets, potentially exposing remote system's IP and port numbers. This information could be leveraged for further targeted attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with access to a gear.",
	    "additional_notes": "For local listeners, OpenShift Enterprise restricts connections to within the gear by default."
