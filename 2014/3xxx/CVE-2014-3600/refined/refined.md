Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Apache ActiveMQ handles XPath selectors when dequeuing XML messages. Specifically, the broker processes XPath expressions specified by the consumer, which triggers XML external entity (XXE) resolution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection. The broker's XML parser processes external entities in the XML data specified in the XPath selector, allowing an attacker to potentially read local files, trigger denial of service, or perform other malicious actions, by crafting a malicious XML message.
- **Unsanitized XPath Evaluation:** The broker allows users to specify arbitrary XPath expressions which, in the context of XML processing, allow the inclusion of malicious XML code for processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Denial of Service:** By crafting malicious XML, an attacker might be able to cause the broker to consume excessive resources leading to a denial of service.
- **Other potential attacks:** Other impacts can include, but are not limited to, port scanning or SSRF through the malicious external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send messages to an ActiveMQ broker and specify XPath selectors as part of dequeuing messages from a queue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a consumer of messages in ActiveMQ
- The attacker needs to be able to define or influence the XPath selector used when retrieving messages.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information also includes the specific versions affected by the vulnerability: Apache ActiveMQ versions 5.0.0 up to and including 5.10.0
- The suggested mitigation involves upgrading to Apache ActiveMQ 5.10.1 or 5.11.0
- The vulnerability was discovered by Georgi Geshev from MWR Labs.
- The related JIRA issue, AMQ-5333, indicates the fix involved making XML parser features configurable using system properties.
