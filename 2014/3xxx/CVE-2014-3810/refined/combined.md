| [AlexT](/AlexT "AlexT")**[AlexT](/AlexT)**[Navigator](/memberships)6101 posts2  There is medium risk security vulnerability in Dolphin 7.1.4 and most probably previous versions are also affected.  In order to perform an attack, an attacker should trick a logged-in administrator to visit a web page with CSRF exploit.   ---   Here is manual fix:  **1)** Add the following code to **administration/profiles.php** file near **~38** line:  $sViewType = isset($\_POST['adm-mp-members-view-type']) && in\_array($\_POST['adm-mp-members-view-type'], array('geeky', 'simple', 'extended')) ? $\_POST['adm-mp-members-view-type'] : BX\_DOL\_ADM\_MP\_VIEW;bx\_import('BxDolForm'); $oChecker = new BxDolFormCheckerHelper(); //--- Process Actions ---//    **2)** Change **~43** line in **administration/profiles.php** file:  $GLOBALS['MySQL']->query("UPDATE `Profiles` SET `Status`='Active' WHERE `ID` IN ('" . implode("','", $\_POST['members']) . "')");  to:  $GLOBALS['MySQL']->query("UPDATE `Profiles` SET `Status`='Active' WHERE `ID` IN ('" . implode("','", $oChecker->passInt($\_POST['members'])) .

A common problem is people grabbing files out of these forums on 2+ year old topics and applying them to current dolphin sites. I have just seen people making that mistake way to many times.EDIT: To late, you already posted it.

For example, can an opt-in email list be setup for Dolphin site owners specifically for Dolphin Security issues?  Then possibly a note (or Join form) could be added to one of the Dolphin installation screens. http://pkforum.dolphinhelp.comQuote · [18 Jun 2014](https://www.boonex.com/forums/topic/Medium-Risk-Security-Vulnerability-in-Dolphin-7-1.htm#242576) |

| [gameutopia](/gameutopia "gameutopia")**[gameutopia](/gameutopia)**[Premium](/memberships)535 posts0  Thanks for checking the current Dolphin .zip Nathan.  I personally can't believe that a publicly posted update/vulnerability was not, and has not been rolled out to the current Dolphin download .zip.  Amazing!  Besides this post, the next thing I would have done was updated the download. 24 hours and counting and still nothing. How crazy is that?  These Boonex folks seem like fairly smart programers, but not so smart in the PR, updates, and such.  Maybe the changes and updates in Trac would conflict. IE all the current updates are not retro-active. So a couple little lines would confuse them too much to worry about updating. I don't know, but even though they call it a medium update, it certainly should be rolled out to the latest download. Actually it should have been shortly after this was posted. What's up with that?

The attached file zip contains, for each dolphin version (D7.0.0-D7.1.4) the original files and the files with the patch.  The original files have been added just for more security (for restoring), for every dolphin version, you can see, under the folder "UPDATE":   * d7XY (folder name, for example d709) * + administration (folder)   + - profiles.php (file)   You have to select your dolphin version, then upload the folder "administration" in your site root.  Remember, you can also back up your file "profiles.php" if for any reason you have customized it. Also, into the folder "ORIGINAL" there are the default files from Boonex (version by version).  We hope this can save your time!

| [medfly](/medfly "medfly")**[medfly](/medfly)**[Advanced](/memberships)217 posts0  Thanks for making zip, but I have a stupid question. So if I follow you upload instruction I will now have 2 administration folders on my root? Or do we upload administration folder into the existing administration file that already exists on root? Or do we just replace it. Sorry I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to this stuff.

Thus what will happen is the administration folder you upload will merge with the existing one. https://www.deanbassett.comQuote · [20 Jun 2014](https://www.boonex.com/forums/topic/Medium-Risk-Security-Vulnerability-in-Dolphin-7-1.htm#242719) |

They should for security fixes, but it's highly unlikely they will. https://www.deanbassett.comQuote · [20 Jun 2014](https://www.boonex.com/forums/topic/Medium-Risk-Security-Vulnerability-in-Dolphin-7-1.htm#242726) |

So if I follow you upload instruction I will now have 2 administration folders on my root? Or do we upload administration folder into the existing administration file that already exists on root? Or do we just replace it. Sorry I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to this stuff.  The files to upload are into the folder "UPDATE"  the folder "ORIGINAL" is just if you want restore the original files See my products at http://www.boonex.com/market/posts/ilbellodelweb | Hosting: zarconia.netQuote · [21 Jun 2014](https://www.boonex.com/forums/topic/Medium-Risk-Security-Vulnerability-in-Dolphin-7-1.htm#242757) |

Note: I was once criticised on the forums for making such statements.  It is because I care about Dolphin being around for a long time.  I am using Dolphin and I have a vested interest in Boonex through Dolphin.  Yes, I am sure that Andrew's business knowledge far exceeds mine; however, I do run a small business.

| [AlexT](/AlexT "AlexT")**[AlexT](/AlexT)**[Navigator](/memberships)6101 posts0  We release urgent new version for critical security flaws, but this one is not critical, moreover it can't be done without tricking logged in administrator, which is very unlikely to happen.

| [gameutopia](/gameutopia "gameutopia")**[gameutopia](/gameutopia)**[Premium](/memberships)535 posts0  Even though this one is not a critical security update you guys really should update the download. It is disappointing that you don't do so. Like I mention new users that download it and install it are going to have no idea even if it is fairly rare that it would affect them. That doesn't matter. I sure as heck wouldn't want to install a vulnerable version if I could get one with out it.    I certainly don't follow forums non-stop for all the software I install. So, I would assume others (new users) certainly don't follow dolphin forums for all the updates. And, they would have missed the announcement email if they just signed up.    Very poor choices in my opinion. Is it so hard to update the .zip or release a 7.1.4a/b or something? If you are not ready to do a 7.1.5. I really don't see why it's so difficult or such a big deal. I guess trac changes might scew it maybe.    At any rate thanks for the update, for those of us who actually received it. Disappointing for new users though.
