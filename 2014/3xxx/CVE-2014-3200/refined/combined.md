## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/10/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, October 7, 2014

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 38 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 38.0.2125.101 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

- A number of new apps/extension APIs

- Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A full list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/37.0.2062.0..38.0.2125.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [159 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+-Security_Severity%3DNone), including [113 relatively minor fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+Stability%3DMemory-MemorySanitizer+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles) found using [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1626)

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2014-3188, CVE-2014-3189, CVE-2014-3190, CVE-2014-3191,
CVE-2014-3192, CVE-2014-3193, CVE-2014-3194, CVE-2014-3199, CVE-2014-3200)

Several information leak flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Chromium
to disclose potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3195,
CVE-2014-3197, CVE-2014-3198)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 38.0.2125.101, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151425#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-10 11:27:38 UTC  ``` Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101 allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have other impact via unknown vectors.   <https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=420899>  External References:  <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2014/10/stable-channel-update.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151425#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-10 11:29:30 UTC  ``` Upstream bug links a long list of other bugs for issue that were (most likely incorrectly) grouped under a single CVE.  With most of those other bugs being non-public, it's quite impossible to determine if any of the corrected issues may affect any WebKit version.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1151425#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-10-14 08:35:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1626 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1626.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1151425#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-07-31 05:43:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of webkitgtk and webkitgtk3 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 respectively.  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |
