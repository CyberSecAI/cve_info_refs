{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of HornetQ REST, where the `resteasy.document.expand.entity.references` context parameter is not set to `false`. This allows the application to expand XML entities, which is a requirement for XXE attacks.",
    "Weaknesses": "The core vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to insecure default settings in the RestEasy library used by HornetQ REST. Specifically, entity expansion is enabled by default.",
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:\n\n  - Read files accessible to the user running the application server.\n  - Potentially perform more advanced XXE attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending maliciously crafted XML requests to a HornetQ REST endpoint.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send XML requests to a vulnerable HornetQ REST endpoint. No authentication or specific privileges beyond network access are mentioned."
