**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious scripts could be injected into the rubric fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the Moodle site
    *   Malware distribution
