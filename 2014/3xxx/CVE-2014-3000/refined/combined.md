How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-14:08.tcp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: TCP reassembly vulnerability
Category: core
Module: inet
Announced: 2014-04-30
Credits: Jonathan Looney
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2014-04-30 04:04:20 UTC (stable/8, 8.4-STABLE)
2014-04-30 04:05:47 UTC (releng/8.4, 8.4-RELEASE-p9)

2014-04-30 04:04:42 UTC (releng/10.0, 10.0-RELEASE-p2)
CVE Name: CVE-2014-3000
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of the TCP/IP protocol suite
provides a connection-oriented, reliable, sequence-preserving data
stream service. When network packets making up a TCP stream (``TCP
segments'') are received out-of-sequence, they are maintained in a
reassembly queue by the destination system until they can be re-ordered
and re-assembled.
II. Problem Description
FreeBSD may add a reassemble queue entry on the stack into the segment list
when the reassembly queue reaches its limit. The memory from the stack is
undefined after the function returns. Subsequent iterations of the
reassembly function will attempt to access this entry.
III. Impact
An attacker who can send a series of specifically crafted packets with a
connection could cause a denial of service situation by causing the kernel
to crash.
Additionally, because the undefined on stack memory may be overwritten by
other kernel threads, while extremely difficult, it may be possible for
an attacker to construct a carefully crafted attack to obtain portion of
kernel memory via a connected socket. This may result in the disclosure of
sensitive information such as login credentials, etc. before or even
without crashing the system.
IV. Workaround
It is possible to defend to these attacks by doing traffic normalization
using a firewall. This can be done by including the following /etc/pf.conf
configuration:
scrub in all
This requires pf(4) to be enabled, and have the mentioned configuration
loaded.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:08/tcp.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:08/tcp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify tcp.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/8/ r265123
releng/8.3/ r265125
releng/8.4/ r265125
stable/9/ r265123

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : kfreebsd-9
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1453 CVE-2014-3000 CVE-2014-3880

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or possibly disclosure of kernel memory. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-1453

    A remote, authenticated attacker could cause the NFS server become
    deadlocked, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2014-3000:

    An attacker who can send a series of specifically crafted packets with a
    connection could cause a denial of service situation by causing the kernel
    to crash.

    Additionally, because the undefined on stack memory may be overwritten by
    other kernel threads, while difficult, it may be possible for an attacker
    to construct a carefully crafted attack to obtain portion of kernel memory
    via a connected socket.  This may result in the disclosure of sensitive
    information such as login credentials, etc. before or even without
    crashing the system.

CVE-2014-3880

    A local attacker can trigger a kernel crash (triple fault) with potential
    data loss, related to the execve/fexecve system calls.
    Reported by Ivo De Decker.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.7.

For the unstable (sid) and testing (jessie) distributions, these problems are fixed
in kfreebsd-10 version 10.0-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
