# CVE request for buffer overrun in CHICKEN Scheme

---

*From*: Peter Bex <Peter.Bex () xs4all nl>

*Date*: Sun, 18 May 2014 13:43:18 +0200

```
Hi all,

I would like to request a CVE for a buffer overrun bug in CHICKEN Scheme
which is very similar to CVE-2013-4385.  It affects a very particular,
not very common use of the read-u8vector! procedure.  If given a buffer
and #f (the Scheme value for "false") as the buffer's size (which should
trigger automatic size detection but doesn't), it will read beyond the
buffer, until the input port (file, socket, etc) is exhausted.  This may
result in the typical potential remote code execution or denial of
service; in CHICKEN, these buffers are initially allocated on the stack
and moved to the heap upon GC.

In normal usage, users would usually pass in the buffer's size.  This
is also the workaround for this bug.

For the official announcement, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2014-05/msg00001.html>

The patch on the discussion list is
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2014-05/msg00032.html>
and it got applied as
<http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commit;h=1d06ce7e21c7e903ca5dca11fda6fcf2cc52de5e>

All versions of CHICKEN prior to 4.9.0 (soon to be released) and 4.8.0.7
(not yet(?) released) are affected.

Cheers,
Peter Bex

Use CVE-2014-3776 for this "should trigger automatic size detection
but doesn't" issue that has a resultant buffer overflow.

Hi hackers,

I believe issue #1124[1] is due to a missing bounds check in
`read-u8vector!`.

Currently, its read size is bounded according to the destination
u8vector's size when a length argument is given, but not when false is
passed for the length instead, leading to a possible buffer overrun. The
attached patch ensures this check is performed for both cases.

This problem (and the fix) is nearly identical to one that was found and
fixed in `read-string!` last year[2], via cd1b977. The patch doesn't
update NEWS yet since, as with CVE-2013-4385, this has security
implications and I think it should be included in the stable release as
well.

## [Chicken-announce] [SECURITY] Buffer-overrun in some uses of read-u8vect

Hello CHICKEN users,

A problem was found with the read-u8vector! procedure from the srfi-4
unit, which is almost identical to CVE-2013-4385 (which related to
the read-string! procedure, see
<https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-09/msg00000.html>
for details).

If read-u8vector! is called with #f as the "NUM" argument, it didn't
bound the read to the u8vector's size, resulting in a buffer overrun
which may lead to general corruption of the stack or heap, and can
potentially be used to execute arbitrary code.

This has been fixed with changeset 1d06ce7e21c7e903ca5dca11fda6fcf2cc52de5e
<http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commit;h=1d06ce7e21c7e903ca5dca11fda6fcf2cc52de5e>

All currently released CHICKENs are vulnerable to this bug: this includes
stable versions up until 4.8.0.6, and all 4.8.x development snapshots.
CHICKEN 4.9.0 and a possible 4.8.0.7 will include the fix, as will all
development snapshots starting with 4.9.1.

Like CVE-2013-4385, only code that uses the destructive read-u8vector!
variant with #f as a length argument is vulnerable.  A similar workaround
helps in this case: Convert all (read-u8vector! #f buf ...) calls to
(read-u8vector! (u8vector-length buf) buf ...), or, if possible, use the
safe, non-destructive read-u8vector version from the srfi-4 unit.

A quick scan of the egg repository indicates that only two eggs use
read-u8vector! in a potentially unsafe way.  The (currently unreleased)
r7rs egg's read-bytevector! procedure maps to read-u8vector!, so any
program using that with #f as the length argument is susceptible to this
vulnerability.  The srfi-27 egg's entropy-source-u8vector procedure also
indirectly exposes the read-u8vector! vulnerability, but it is
undocumented that a LENGTH of #f is allowed.

This means that applications should be safe if they don't call
read-u8vector! directly with a #f size and use only documented
functionality of released eggs.

Kind regards,
The CHICKEN team
