Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way the Ruby vSphere Console (RVC), included with the VMware vCenter Server Appliance, handles commands. Specifically, the RVC allows commands to be executed with elevated privileges which allows a user to break out of a chroot jail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability to execute commands with higher privileges than intended within the chroot environment.
*   **Chroot Breakout:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the confines of the chroot jail, a security mechanism designed to limit the scope of an application's access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining root privileges allows an attacker to take complete control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Although the exploit is local to the vCenter appliance, it can be triggered by a remote attacker who has initial access to the Ruby vSphere Console (RVC).
*   **Authentication Required:** Successful exploitation requires prior authentication to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the vCenter Server Appliance and access the RVC.
*   **Access to the RVC:** The attacker must be able to use the Ruby vSphere Console (RVC) to execute commands.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability specifically affects vCenter Server Appliance versions 5.1 and 5.5.
*   **Mitigation:** VMware recommended removing users from the "shellaccess" group or removing the "AllowGroups shellaccess wheel" line from the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and restarting the sshd service as mitigations.
*   **Zero-Day Disclosure:** This vulnerability was disclosed publicly without a patch after the 180-day disclosure deadline.
