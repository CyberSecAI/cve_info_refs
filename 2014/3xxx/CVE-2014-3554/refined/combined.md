Message-ID: <53D78EF3.9000709@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 29 Jul 2014 22:09:23 +1000
From: Murray McAllister <mmcallis@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2014-3554: libndp buffer overflow

Good morning,

The below was previously sent to the distros list. A patch is available
from <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=917255>

libndp (libndp.org) provides a library for the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
Protocol. Andrew Ayer discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the
ndp_msg_opt_dnssl_domain() function when handling the DNS Search List
(DNSSL) in IPv6 router advertisements. A malicious router or
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to cause an application
using libndp to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3554)

Please credit Andrew Ayer with the discovery.

Cheers,

Subject: [PATCH] libndp: fix buffer overflow in ndp\_msg\_opt\_dnssl\_domain()
The buf array would overflow when processing a malformed DNSSL option
containing a domain name whose labels' combined length exceeded 255 bytes.
To facilitate the bounds checking, the code has been restructured slightly
to be simpler and avoid repeated calls to strlen and strcat.
