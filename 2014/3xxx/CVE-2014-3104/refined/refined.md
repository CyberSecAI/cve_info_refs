- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of XML entity expansions in IBM Rational ClearQuest.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specially crafted XML requests to the vulnerable system, which trigger excessive entity expansion, leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send XML requests to the server running IBM Rational ClearQuest.
