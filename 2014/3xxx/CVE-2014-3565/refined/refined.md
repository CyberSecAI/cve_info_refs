  "CVE-2014-3565": {
    "description": "The net-snmp packages provide various libraries and tools for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including an SNMP library, an extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting information from SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a version of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management Information Base (MIB) browser.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain SNMP traps when started with the \"-OQ\" option. If an attacker sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `snmptrapd` service, when started with the `-OQ` option, incorrectly handles SNMP traps containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer type is expected.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Type confusion"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted SNMP trap, leading to the `snmptrapd` service crashing.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a malicious SNMP trap over the network."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send SNMP traps to the affected system. No authentication is required to trigger the crash.",
       "affected_components": [
          "snmptrapd (part of the net-snmp package)",
           "net-snmp library"
