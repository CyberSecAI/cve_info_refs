| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-31 08:22:08 UTC  ``` A remote denial-of-service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain SNMP traps when started with the "-OQ" option. If an attacker sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c2)  Jan Safranek    2014-07-31 08:43:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Murray McAllister from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c0)) > A remote denial-of-service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled SNMP > traps containing a ifMtu with a NULL type when started with the "-OQ" > option.   Well, it's not about ifMtu, it's about *any* integer variable, disguised as Null in a SNMP trap. I used ifMtu just for testing, I did not have original HP MIB files.  You know, SNMP objects have types. The types are described in a MIB file, usually part of a RFC. Problem is, when there is conflict between the definition of the object in the MIB file (which says the object is 'integer') and the trap packet itself (which says the object is 'null'). snmptrapd trusts the MIB file and does not check the type in the packet.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-27 02:27:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 931224](attachment.cgi?id=931224&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931224&action=edit "patch") patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-01 00:51:02 UTC  ``` This issue is public now:  <http://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/code/ci/7f4a7b891332899cea26e95be0337aae01648742/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c7)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-01 00:52:39 UTC  ```  Created net-snmp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1135828](show_bug.cgi?id=1135828 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3565 net-snmp: snmptrapd crash when handling an SNMP trap containing a ifMtu with a NULL type [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-09-09 22:10:49 UTC  ``` net-snmp-5.7.2-18.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-31 08:22:08 UTC  ``` A remote denial-of-service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain SNMP traps when started with the "-OQ" option. If an attacker sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c2)  Jan Safranek    2014-07-31 08:43:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Murray McAllister from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c0)) > A remote denial-of-service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled SNMP > traps containing a ifMtu with a NULL type when started with the "-OQ" > option.   Well, it's not about ifMtu, it's about *any* integer variable, disguised as Null in a SNMP trap. I used ifMtu just for testing, I did not have original HP MIB files.  You know, SNMP objects have types. The types are described in a MIB file, usually part of a RFC. Problem is, when there is conflict between the definition of the object in the MIB file (which says the object is 'integer') and the trap packet itself (which says the object is 'null'). snmptrapd trusts the MIB file and does not check the type in the packet.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-08-27 02:27:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 931224](attachment.cgi?id=931224&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931224&action=edit "patch") patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-01 00:51:02 UTC  ``` This issue is public now:  <http://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/code/ci/7f4a7b891332899cea26e95be0337aae01648742/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c7)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-01 00:52:39 UTC  ```  Created net-snmp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1135828](show_bug.cgi?id=1135828 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3565 net-snmp: snmptrapd crash when handling an SNMP trap containing a ifMtu with a NULL type [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1125155#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-09-09 22:10:49 UTC  ``` net-snmp-5.7.2-18.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](#c0)  Ed Catmur    2004-05-27 12:20:27 UTC  ``` See, for instance, [bug 51705](show_bug.cgi?id=51705 "RESOLVED FIXED - vim 6.3b would like testing"). If we are to be able to test packages not ready for unstable yet then we need to be able to unmask them without having to continually check what KEYWORDS they currently have. When an arch is missing from KEYWORDS it simply means that that arch is untested; it should not be made overly difficult for testing to be carried out by non-developers.  The attached patch allows a package.keywords of "*" to match all KEYWORDS except "-arch".  I understand that the last thing we want is users installing untested packages left right and centre and filing pointless bugs; as such I am happy to make any changes necessary to prevent the use of this proposed feature by the great unwashed. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ed Catmur    2004-05-27 12:22:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32155](attachment.cgi?id=32155 "Proposed patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=32155&action=edit "Proposed patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=32155&action=diff "Proposed patch")] Proposed patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ciaran McCreesh    2004-05-27 12:46:27 UTC  ``` Hrm, for arch maintainers, this could be fairly useful... For sparc testing we usually tell people to stick ~x86 x86 in package.keywords for testing unkeyworded apps, but this is kinda messy. One other possibility -- how about * (matches stable on any arch) and ~* (~arch)?  Cc:ing sparc because getting lots of bugzilla emails makes us feel loved, erm, I mean because this could influence some of our documentation. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ed Catmur    2004-05-27 16:47:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32175](attachment.cgi?id=32175 "New patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=32175&action=edit "New patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=32175&action=diff "New patch")] New patch  Yes, I prefer that suggestion. This implementation is a little verbose but is efficient and readable. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ed Catmur    2004-05-27 17:05:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32177](attachment.cgi?id=32177 "Replacement patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=32177&action=edit "Replacement patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=32177&action=diff "Replacement patch")] Replacement patch  Oops, that was broken. Use this. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-05-27 21:04:10 UTC  ``` ive been doing the same exact thing when porting to arm ... sticking '~x86 x86' into package.keywords and just assuming that the package works for x86 :)  something like this would be cool ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-28 16:00:41 UTC  ``` I think it's slightly off on the ~* logic.  You have it only matching ~arch and not stable in that case. Including and modifying a little. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-28 16:02:36 UTC  ```         if "~*" in pgroups:           for gp in mygroups:             if gp[0] != "-":               match=1               break  ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Ciaran McCreesh    2004-05-28 16:14:38 UTC  ``` If I add ~x86 to package.keywords, it only matches ~x86, not x86, right? ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Ed Catmur    2004-05-29 05:59:00 UTC  ``` Yes, that was my understanding and the reason I wrote the patch the way I did. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Brian Harring (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-16 11:38:48 UTC  ``` As far as I can tell, this is in pre18. Reopen if I'm wrong :) ``` |  |

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Doing so, it blindly closes all filedescriptors lower than current resource limit of opened files (ulimit -n, /proc/sys/fs/file-max). Consequence: When these limits are high, it may take some time to close these filedescriptors and snmpd thus slowly reacts to GET request in NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Table. Fix: snmpd does not read resource limits from operating system, instead it finds out on its own which file descriptors it uses. Result: Requests in NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Table are much faster. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1252048](show_bug.cgi?id=1252048 "CLOSED ERRATA - net-snmp snmpd fork() overhead [fix available]")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1252048)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2015-07-22 07:23:18 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1188295#c0)  Andy Fletcher    2015-02-02 14:42:22 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  NB. This is not limited to RHEL6 (also affects RHEL5/7).  Due to the way snmpd handles file descriptors when forking scripts for 'pass' or 'extend', on systems with very large numbers of FD, this will consume CPU and take several seconds for each OID.  Please consider back porting the following fix: <https://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/code/ci/0e4bf5d3659c459128c0f98926b0db7296e9c49f/>   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Observed on all releases, including 5.7   How reproducible: Every time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. increase fs-max/nofile to large value (32626630 in test case) 2. configure snmp pass or extend in snmpd.conf 3. get/walk the OID  Actual results: Several seconds of 100% CPU utilisation, SNMP response takes several seconds. snmpwalk (for 'pass' that support this) time out.  Expected results: Immediate response, minimal CPU utilisation   Additional info: Please consider back porting the following fix: <https://sourceforge.net/p/net-snmp/code/ci/0e4bf5d3659c459128c0f98926b0db7296e9c49f/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1188295#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 07:23:18 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1385)

## Topic

Updated net-snmp packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The net-snmp packages provide various libraries and tools for the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including an SNMP library, an
extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting information from SNMP
agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a version of the
netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management Information Base
(MIB) browser.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled certain
SNMP traps when started with the "-OQ" option. If an attacker sent an SNMP
trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an integer variable type
was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash. (CVE-2014-3565)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses object was not implemented

because parts of the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB module were rewritten in an earlier
version of net-snmp. Consequently, HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses
did not provide information on the number of currently loaded or running
processes. With this update, HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses has been
implemented, and the net-snmp daemon reports as expected. (BZ#1134335)

* The Net-SNMP agent daemon, snmpd, reloaded the system ARP table every 60

seconds. As a consequence, snmpd could cause a short CPU usage spike on
busy systems with a large APR table. With this update, snmpd does not
reload the full ARP table periodically, but monitors the table changes
using a netlink socket. (BZ#789500)

* Previously, snmpd used an invalid pointer to the current time when

periodically checking certain conditions specified by the "monitor" option
in the /etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf file. Consequently, snmpd terminated
unexpectedly on start with a segmentation fault if a certain entry with the
"monitor" option was used. Now, snmpd initializes the correct pointer
to the current time, and snmpd no longer crashes on start. (BZ#1050970)

* Previously, snmpd expected 8-bit network interface indices when

processing HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrDeviceTable. If an interface index of a
local network interface was larger than 30,000 items, snmpd could terminate
unexpectedly due to accessing invalid memory. Now, processing of all
network sizes is enabled, and snmpd no longer crashes in the described
situation. (BZ#1195547)

* The snmpdtrapd service incorrectly checked for errors when forwarding a

trap with a RequestID value of 0, and logged "Forward failed" even though
the trap was successfully forwarded. This update fixes snmptrapd checks and
the aforementioned message is now logged only when appropriate.
(BZ#1146948)

* Previously, snmpd ignored the value of the "storageUseNFS" option in the

/etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf file. As a consequence, NFS drivers were shown as
"Network Disks", even though "storageUseNFS" was set to "2" to report them
as "Fixed Disks" in HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable. With this update,
snmpd takes the "storageUseNFS" option value into account, and "Fixed Disks"
NFS drives are reported correctly. (BZ#1125793)

* Previously, the Net-SNMP python binding used an incorrect size (8 bytes

instead of 4) for variables of IPADDRESS type. Consequently, applications
that were using Net-SNMP Python bindings could send malformed SNMP
messages. With this update, the bindings now use 4 bytes for variables with
IPADRESS type, and only valid SNMP messages are sent. (BZ#1100099)

* Previously, the snmpd service did not cut values in

HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable to signed 32-bit integers, as required
by SNMP standards, and provided the values as unsigned integers. As a
consequence, the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable implementation did not
conform to RFC 2790. The values are now cut to 32-bit signed integers, and
snmpd is therefore standard compliant. (BZ#1104293)

Users of net-snmp are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

# SNMP: Denial of service — GLSA **201507-17**

A vulnerability in SNMP could lead to a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/net-snmp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.7.3\_pre5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.7.3\_pre5-r1** |

### Background

SNMP is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of
network equipment.

### Description

A specially crafted trap message triggers a conversion to an erroneous
variable type when the -OQ option is used.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SNMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=net-analyzer/net-snmp-5.7.3_pre5-r1"

```
