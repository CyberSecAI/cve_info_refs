- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in IBM QRadar.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided content does not specify the impact, but typical XSS vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through reflected XSS, likely involving manipulation of a URL or other input fields that are reflected back to the user without proper sanitization or encoding.
