Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3647:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly check for non-canonical addresses when emulating instructions that modify the instruction pointer (RIP) register, such as jumps, calls, and returns.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of non-canonical addresses during RIP modifications within the KVM emulator.
- Lack of checks to ensure the validity of target addresses for near branches.
- Potential for a failed VM entry if the target address is non-canonical after a jump, call, or return instruction.
- Inconsistency in the VMCS/VMCB state if loading a new CS fails during a far jump/call/ret instruction in 64-bit mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Guest OS crash (denial of service)
- Potential for a failed vm-entry if an invalid address is used.

**Attack vectors:**
- Guest OS user with access to I/O or MMIO regions within the virtual machine.
- Specifically, the issue is exploitable by manipulating instructions that change the RIP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must have the ability to execute code within a guest OS.
- Needs access to I/O or MMIO resources.
- Requires knowledge of how to craft instructions leading to non-canonical RIP address changes.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed through a series of patches that included:
    - Adding checks to the `assign_eip_far` function to ensure the target address is canonical.
    - Modifying `assign_eip_near` function to use `assign_eip_far`
    - Correcting emulation for near branches and validating target addresses
    - Adding error handling for far jumps/calls/rets during new RIP assignment and restoring of old CS if new RIP loading fails in 64 bit mode.
- The vulnerability affects various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE.
- Red Hat also acknowledged and addressed the issue in their products.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by both near and far branches and calls.

The provided information gives a good overview of the vulnerability, its root cause, exploitation vectors and impacts, along with some details on how it was fixed.
