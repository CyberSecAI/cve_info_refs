  "CVE-2014-3573": {
    "description": "It was discovered that, when loading XML/RSDL documents, the oVirt Engine back end module used an insecure DocumentBuilderFactory. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the ovirt-engine server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.",
