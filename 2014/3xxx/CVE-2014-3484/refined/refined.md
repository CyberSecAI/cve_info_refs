The provided content is related to CVE-2014-3484.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An error in the `dn_expand` function of musl libc, introduced by commit `fcc522c92335783293ac19df318415cd97fbf66b`, caused incorrect checking of the remaining output buffer space. This allowed malformed input to write past the end of the buffer.
- Additionally, the loop detection logic did not account for the possibility of infinite loops with no output, which would hang the function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The incorrect output buffer space check allows an attacker to write past the end of the buffer on the stack.
- Infinite loop vulnerability: The faulty loop detection logic can lead to denial of service due to infinite loops with no output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote stack-based buffer overflow: Could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of service: Caused by infinite loop leading to program hang.

**Attack vectors:**
-  DNS queries made by programs linked against musl libc.
- Attackers can control configured nameservers in `resolv.conf`.
- Attackers can inject forged UDP packets with control over their contents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control a nameserver or be able to inject forged UDP packets. This is most feasible if the attacker has already compromised network infrastructure components (nameservers, routers, etc.).
