Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-3591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The ElGamal decryption routine in libgcrypt (and consequently GnuPG which uses libgcrypt) was susceptible to a side-channel attack. This attack exploits information leaked through electromagnetic emanations during the decryption process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Side-Channel Leakage:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the decryption process leaks information through electromagnetic emanations. This leakage is dependent on the key being used, specifically the key-bits window in the exponentiation routine during decryption.
- **Lack of Ciphertext Blinding:** The original implementation of the ElGamal decryption did not employ ciphertext blinding which could have masked the key dependent information being leaked.
- **Chosen Ciphertext Attack:** The attack is enabled by the ability to send chosen ciphertexts to be decrypted by the target. This ability allows an attacker to craft the ciphertext specifically to maximize information leakage and extract the secret key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Secret Key Extraction:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to extract the secret decryption key. This can be done by measuring the electromagnetic emanations from the target machine as it performs decryption of chosen ciphertexts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Electromagnetic Emanations:** The primary attack vector involves measuring electromagnetic emanations from the target computer using readily available equipment (consumer-grade radio receivers, Software Defined Radio (SDR) USB dongles, loop antennas).
- **Chosen Ciphertext Injection:** The attacker needs the ability to inject specially crafted ciphertexts into the targeted system and have the system decrypt these messages using the targeted secret key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within close physical proximity of the target computer (within a few decimeters).
- **Ciphertext Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted ciphertext to the target. This can be achieved via various means such as email or file transfer.
- **Signal Processing Knowledge:** The attacker needs some expertise in signal processing to extract the key information from the recorded emanations.
