Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle the `INVVPID` instruction. Specifically, it lacked a designated exit handler for this instruction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Exit Handler:** The core weakness is the absence of a specific handler for the `INVVPID` instruction within the KVM's virtual machine exit handling mechanism.
- **VM Exit Handling Flaw:** This leads to improper processing when a guest OS issues an `INVVPID` instruction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Guest OS Crash:** A guest OS user can trigger a denial of service leading to a crash of the guest operating system.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation**: Although not directly specified, improper VM exit handling could potentially lead to further exploitation depending on the specific context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user within the guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest OS Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within the guest OS, specifically code capable of issuing the `INVVPID` instruction.
- **No Elevated Host Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a standard user within the guest OS without needing to have special privileges on the host machine.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c` in the KVM subsystem.
- The fix involves adding `handle_invvpid` to process the VM exit, and using `kvm_queue_exception` with the `UD_VECTOR` to emulate the undefined instruction to trigger a guest crash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content indicates that this vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions through 3.17.2.
- The fix has been backported and addressed in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other Linux distributions.
- The vulnerability is present on systems with Intel processors that support `INVVPID`.
- The exploit does not directly affect the host OS.

The content also shows a race condition issue in PIT emulation code in KVM (CVE-2014-3611) but this is a separate vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2014-3646 describes a flaw in the KVM implementation that allows an unprivileged guest user to cause a denial of service (crash) in the guest OS. This is achieved by leveraging the lack of a handler for the `INVVPID` instruction within the KVM subsystem.
