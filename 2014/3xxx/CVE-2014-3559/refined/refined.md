The provided content relates to CVE-2014-3559.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The oVirt storage backend did not wipe memory snapshots when VMs were deleted, even if the "wipe-after-delete" (WAD) option was enabled for the VM's disks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to sanitize or wipe memory snapshots after VM deletion.
- Inadequate handling of storage volumes when WAD is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker with credentials to create a new VM could potentially access the contents of memory snapshots in an uninitialized storage volume.
- Disclosure of sensitive information from the memory snapshots.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access with valid credentials to create VMs.
- Exploiting the lack of memory snapshot wiping after VM deletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Need to have credentials to create a new VM within the oVirt environment.
- Network access to the oVirt environment to exploit the vulnerability remotely.
