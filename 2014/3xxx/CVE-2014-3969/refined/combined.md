            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-3969 / XSA-98
                              version 5

       insufficient permissions checks accessing guest memory on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

The issue described in update 4 also affects Xen 4.5 which was not
released at the time of the original advisory.  The extra patch
supplied with version 4 of this advisory is for Xen 4.5.x (as well as
4.4.x and xen-unstable).

Added credits for updated issue.

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Supply an additional patch for arm64. The original patches had the
permissions check backwards, meaning that a guest could read a
write-only mapping and vice versa, rendering the original fix
ineffective an inparticular not closing down the ability for a guest
to write to a readonly page via the hypervisor.

This issue was discussed on a public IRC channel and therefore it has
been agreed with the discoverer that it should not subject to a new
embargo.

32-bit ARM systems are not affected by this mistake; the original fix
remains correct for 32-bit.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When accessing guest memory Xen does not correctly perform permissions
checks on the (possibly guest provided) virtual address: it only
checks that the mapping is readable by the guest, even when writing on
behalf of the guest.  This allows a guest to write to memory which
it should only be able to read.

A guest running on a vulnerable system is able to write to memory
which should be read-only.  This includes supposedly read only foreign
mappings established using the grant table mechanism.  Such read-only
mappings are commonly used as part of the paravirtualised I/O drivers
(such as guest disk write and network transmit).

In order to exploit this vulnerability the guest must have a mapping
of the memory; it does not allow access to arbitrary addresses.

In the event that a guest executes code from a page which has been
shared read-only with another guest it would be possible to mount a
take over attack on that guest.

IMPACT
======

A domain which is deliberately exchanging data with another,
malicious, domain, may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.  The
vulnerability depends on the precise behaviour of the victim domain.

In a typical configuration this means that, depending on the behaviour
of the toolstack or device driver domain, a malicious guest
administrator might be able to escalate their privilege to that of the
whole host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.

MITIGATION
==========

None.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall.

The additional issue reported in update 4 was discovered by Tamas K
Lengyel.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches along with the
additional update resolves this issue.

Use CVE-2014-3969.

Our understanding is that "executes code from a page which has been
shared read-only" depends on the permissions issue (lack of a check
for execute permission), and is not an independent problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
