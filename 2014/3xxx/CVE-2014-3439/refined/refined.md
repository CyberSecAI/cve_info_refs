{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in `ConsoleServlet` allows an attacker to specify the application server thread name via the `ActionType` parameter. The thread name is used in the pattern passed to the `java.util.logging.FileHandler` constructor. This allows an attacker to define the log file path. By causing an exception in the thread, the log file is written to disk.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated arbitrary file write/overwrite",
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary files can be written or overwritten by an unauthenticated attacker. The target file is truncated in the process which results in Denial of Service. It might also be possible to write files with arbitrary content by leveraging the debug logging and HTTP headers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/servlet/ConsoleServlet` endpoint with a manipulated `ActionType` parameter"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
