Subject: Re: Ubuntu 14.04: security problem in the lock screen

Hi,

While that particular bug was fixed before 14.04 was released, it's probably
worth assigning a CVE to it anyway for tracking purposes, since I have now
published a security update that corrects two more lock screen bugs.

Here's a summary:

Issue #1 (Before 14.04 came out):

Marco Agnese discovered that Unity 7.2.0 incorrectly handled entry activation on
the lock screen, resulting in the lock screen crashing and the session becoming
unlocked.

Reference:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308572](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308572)
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity/trunk/revision/3787>

Issue #2:

Giovanni Mellini discovered that Unity 7.2.0 could display the Dash in certain
conditions when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use
this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308850](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308850)
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity/trunk/revision/3789>
<http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2184-1/>

Issue #3:

Frédéric Bardy discovered that Unity 7.2.0 incorrectly filtered keyboard
shortcuts when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use
this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1313885](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1313885)

<http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2184-1/>

Could CVEs please be assigned to these three issues?

Thanks!

Marc.

### Bug Description

[Impact]

This is 100% reproducible on my side with an updated 14.04

I have a laptop that after 3 minutes of inactivity shutdown the screen and lock-it.

If I press the SUPER button to activate the dash and then I wait 3 minutes for auto screen locking the screen become black.

After that when I move the mouse to go to lockscreen and unlock my session, I see the dash on top of the lockscreen.

I can digit my password and unlock the laptop pressing enter but I cannot see the username, box, dots etc

I think that the screenshot attached explain very whell what I'm writing.

I think that this is a security problem because as you can see from my screenshot other people can see my personal data (file and folders) without authorization.

[Test Case]

(1) Make sure the screen lock is enabled and has a reasonable timeout set.

(2) Use the Super button to activate the Dash.

(3) Wait for the screen lock timeout so the lockscreen / screensaver comes up.

(4) Move the mouse or press a shift key to display the lockscreen.

(5) The Dash should not appear on top of the lockscreen.

[Regression Potential]

None. The fix is to explicitly undisplay the dash when the screen is locked.

# USN-2184-1: Unity vulnerabilities

29 April 2014

The Unity lock screen could be bypassed.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Packages

* [unity](/security/cves?package=unity) - Interface designed for efficiency of space and interaction.

## Details

Frédéric Bardy discovered that Unity incorrectly filtered keyboard

shortcuts when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use

this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.

Subject: Re: Ubuntu 14.04: security problem in the lock screen

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Issues #1, #2, and #3 are clearly within the scope of CVE, and have
their CVE IDs below. The common theme is "the user intended to lock
the screen, the UI indicates that the screen is successfully locked,
the user physically leaves, but this locking can then be bypassed by a
physically present attacker."

Two of the other bugs referenced within pages for #1, #2, and #3 are

  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308572/comments/6](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308572/comments/6)

and

  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/49579](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver/%2Bbug/49579)

Quite possibly, these should also have CVE IDs, but there are
potentially valid counterarguments. First, at a high level, neither of
these matches the "common theme" described above.

For 1308572/comments/6, one counterargument is that a user isn't
entitled to expect that screen locking will continue to work
flawlessly if he decides to kill arbitrary processes that are, more or
less, related to screen/display functionality. Also, the risk is very
low in the sense that, before a user physically left, it would usually
be obvious that the screen was not successfully locked. However, there
is conceivably a scenario in which killing compiz is a supported (or,
at least, reasonable) user activity, and the user must leave
immediately after a screen-locking attempt without waiting even a few
seconds.

For 49579, there are many ways to summarize the long discussion: here
is one of them. A typical end user may expect that automatic screen
locking succeeds regardless of what the user had been doing (e.g., if
the user was in the middle of a menu operation). A developer may
expect that automatic screen locking succeeds in cases where the
implementation is achievable in a reasonable amount of time. There are
(at least) three possible conclusions:

  1. The end user wins. This is a vulnerability regardless of what
     documentation exists, because it is unreasonable to expect an end
     user to learn about the failure conditions.

  2. This is a vulnerability if the documentation is not "good
     enough." For example, if the only documentation is bug 49579
     itself, maybe that's not enough.

  3. The developer wins. This is never a vulnerability. Yes, it would
     be nice for automatic screen locking to succeed in more cases,
     but this is not a high-value security feature for all users, and
     it's OK for development to use a "reasonable effort" approach
     rather than a "must cover every possible case at all costs"
     approach.

### Bug Description

[Impact]

This is 100% reproducible on my side with an updated 14.04

I have a laptop that after 3 minutes of inactivity shutdown the screen and lock-it.

If I press the SUPER button to activate the dash and then I wait 3 minutes for auto screen locking the screen become black.

After that when I move the mouse to go to lockscreen and unlock my session, I see the dash on top of the lockscreen.

I can digit my password and unlock the laptop pressing enter but I cannot see the username, box, dots etc

I think that the screenshot attached explain very whell what I'm writing.

I think that this is a security problem because as you can see from my screenshot other people can see my personal data (file and folders) without authorization.

[Test Case]

(1) Make sure the screen lock is enabled and has a reasonable timeout set.

(2) Use the Super button to activate the Dash.

(3) Wait for the screen lock timeout so the lockscreen / screensaver comes up.

(4) Move the mouse or press a shift key to display the lockscreen.

(5) The Dash should not appear on top of the lockscreen.

[Regression Potential]

None. The fix is to explicitly undisplay the dash when the screen is locked.
