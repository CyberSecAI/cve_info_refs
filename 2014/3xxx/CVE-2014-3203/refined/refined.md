Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Unity 7.2.0's failure to properly hide the Dash interface when the screen is locked. This allows the Dash to be displayed on top of the lock screen under certain circumstances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper state management: The Unity lock screen mechanism doesn't correctly ensure that the Dash is hidden when the screen is locked.
- UI layering issue: The Dash is rendered on top of the lock screen, revealing potentially sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Information Disclosure: A local attacker can see the user's personal data (files and folders) displayed in the Dash without authorization.
- Session Unlocking: It is stated that a local attacker could possibly use this issue to run commands and unlock the current session, although it's not clearly detailed how.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local Access: The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine.
- User Interaction: The user needs to have the Dash activated prior to screen lock, for example by pressing the SUPER key. Then, after the screen locks, the attacker would move the mouse or press a shift key to display the lockscreen, with the Dash visible on top of it.
- Timing: The attack relies on the timing of when the screen is locked and the state of the Dash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Physical access to the target machine.
- Ability to interact with the computer's keyboard/mouse.

**Additional Information:**

- The bug report provides a clear test case to reproduce the issue.
- The fix involves explicitly hiding the Dash when the screen is locked.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Unity version 7.2.0+14.04.20140423-0ubuntu1.1
- This vulnerability is one of three related issues fixed in the same security update (USN-2184-1).
