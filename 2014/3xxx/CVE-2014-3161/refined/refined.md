Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The provided text indicates a "Same origin policy bypass" vulnerability. This suggests the vulnerability lies in how Chrome for Android enforces the same-origin policy, allowing a malicious actor to potentially bypass this security mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is the bypass of the same-origin policy, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers. This policy is designed to prevent scripts from one origin (e.g., website) from accessing data or manipulating content from a different origin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious webpage to access data or manipulate elements of another, unrelated webpage.  This could lead to:
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information from other websites, such as login credentials, personal data, or financial details.
    - Content manipulation: Modifying content on other websites, potentially injecting malicious scripts, or changing the appearance of the website for phishing attacks.
    - Session hijacking: Potentially impersonating a user on a website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious webpage that can somehow bypass the same-origin policy in Chrome for Android.  The attacker would need to host the malicious webpage and trick a user into visiting the page using the vulnerable version of Chrome.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to:
    - Host a malicious webpage.
    - Entice a user to visit the malicious webpage using Chrome for Android with the vulnerability.
