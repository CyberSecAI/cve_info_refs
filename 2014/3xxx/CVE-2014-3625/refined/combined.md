# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Spring Framework's Migration from Jira to GitHub Issues

[Engineering](/blog/category/engineering) | [Rossen Stoyanchev](/team/rstoyanchev) |  January 15, 2019 | [...](/blog/2019/01/15/spring-framework-s-migration-from-jira-to-github-issues#disqus_thread)

The Spring Framework has migrated its entire history of issues from Jira to GitHub. The goal of this blog post is to provide you with context and details about this move.

# Migration Details

---

The entire 15+ year history of every Spring Framework issue, and every comment, has been imported into GitHub. There is a lot to consider in such a move, so let's take a tour and go over some details.

### Links

If you have a link to an existing issue, e.g. <https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16751>, you'll be redirected to the corresponding GitHub issue. If you actually mean to go to the Jira issue, append the query parameter `redirect=false`. On the GitHub side, the imported issue has a link back to its Jira issue origin.

Jira issue keys that appear in text, e.g. "SPR-16751", have been replaced with GitHub [issue references](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/) which has the benefit of inserting links in the timelines of issues on both sides. Another benefit is the mini-preview when you mouse over the link.

Jira issues keys to other Spring projects that appear in text, e.g. "DATAJPA-813", have been replaced with links. For example see [#18558](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18558) with a link to Spring Data JPA, [#20904](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20904) to Spring Data MongoDB, and [#16906](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/16906) to Spring Integration Extensions.

Links to other GitHub project issues and pull requests that appear in text, get automatic benefits. After the migration, there are links in the timelines of the referenced issues that point back to the Spring Framework, and you get a preview of the link with a mouse over. For example see [#21362](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21362) with a link to Spring Boot, [#20849](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20849#issuecomment-453465173) to JUnit, [#20256](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/20256) to Jackson.

Links to commits and source code of any project on GitHub, get automatic benefits too. For example see the link to a source code range in issue [#18463](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18463).

### Jira Details

Every imported issue displays information from Jira in the bottom half of its description. The idea is that all information from Jira is available on GitHub and you don't have to go back and forth between the two. You may see one or more of the following, when available:

* Affected versions
* Reference URL
* Attachments
* Sub-tasks and related issues
* Pull requests and commit references
* Backport versions
* Vote and watcher counts

Note that votes and watch subscriptions could not be carried over to GitHub. Even if spring-issuemaster has full privileges, it can only vote once. So please visit GitHub issues and re-apply reactions and subscribe to receive updates for specific issues.

### Labels

Some Jira fields were converted to GitHub issue labels:

| Jira Field | Label |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Type | `"type: *"` |
| Status | `"status: *"` |
| Resolution | `"status: *"` |
| Component | `"in: *"` |

Two extra labels were also applied to imported issues:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"has: votes-jira"` | imported issues with 10+ votes |
| `"has: backports"` | issues with backport versions |

We used the opportunity to streamline the Jira field values, so for example 25 component values in Jira correspond to 5 `"in: *"` labels on GitHub. The `"status: *"` and the `"type: *"` labels have also been given extra through and revised.

Our choice of labels is aligned with the labels used in Spring Boot. The Boot team has given their process and labels a lot of thought, and we know the consistency will be appreciated by many. See the complete [set of labels](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/labels).

In Jira, many fields and labels are modifiable. In GitHub, only contributors can add or remove labels. This makes perfect sense. Reporters simply describe the issue, while contributors categorize it. Both developers and contributors can use the labels to search.

### Fix Versions

A Jira issue can have multiple fix versions, while a GitHub issue can have only one target milestone. This feels like a drawback but there is more than is apparent to the eye, and the constraint has forced us to consider some meaningful adjustments.

Take [SPR-17226](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17226?redirect=false) for example with fix versions "4.3.19", "5.0.9", and "5.1 RC3". While the issue was fixed in all 3 versions, there is no need to pollute the release notes of "5.1 RC3" which was still in development at the time. We can instead say it was fixed in 5.0.9 and backported to 4.3.19, and it's a contributors' concern to make sure the fix is propagated to the next version that's still in development. This is how it shows on the GitHub issue [#21759](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21759) Could we have made this adjustment in the past? Sure, but the support for multiple fix versions in Jira didn't force us to consider.

This is a small adjustment that will result in cleaner release notes, but it will also impact the way we commit fixes. When the next version is in development on master, we will apply the fix to the current production branch first, then forward merge to master, and then cherry-pick from the older production branch. As opposed to apply the fix to master, and then cherry-pick from the production branches. The result is a cleaner commit history since forward merges help git to be aware or related changes.

As for backports, since an issue can have only one target milestone, we must create separate issues to represent the backporting of a fix. To use the same example, it pays to pick "5.0.9" as the target milestone because we'd have one backport issue only. If we picked "5.1 RC3", we would need two backport issues instead. To give you sense of the huge difference this makes, say the Spring Framework was on GitHub Issues from day 1. If we used the latter approach we'd have about 2,500 backport issues today. If we used the former, we would have about a 1000.

For historic backports, we've created one issue holder per release. There are about [45 of those](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=in%3Atitle+%22backported+issues%22). Going forward we'll have individual issues for all backported fixes which will be created automatically and used mainly for release tracking. As for discussions, the majority of conversations should happen on the main issue, while backport issues will be used only for discussions specific to the backport.

### Markup

The markup was without a doubt the biggest and most painful part of the migration. A 15 year history of issue tracking reflects big shifts in programming styles styles that in turn determine what shows up in comments.

For example lots of XML was pasted in comments in the beginning, and Markdown treats that as [HTML blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#html-blocks) which results in the tags not showing at all. Of course if those were surrounded with `{code:xml}...{code}`, it would look fine, but in those days markup wasn't commonly used and the XML snippets showed up anyway, not forcing the issue, and consequently making it impossible to migrate properly.

There are lots of other intricacies such as the escaping of curly braces, to avoid the effect of monospacing, or the escaping of asterisks to prevent them from disappearing as markup for bold. I'll spare you the details. Suffice to say we put a lot of effort into making sure the quality of markup conversion is reasonably high.

One specific issue to highlight is the use of "@" in plain text (i.e. outside of code blocks). Those are user mentions on GitHub that trigger notifications. You might be surprised that [@Bean](https://github.com/bean), [@Configuration](https://github.com/configuration), [@Component](https://github.com/component) are actual GitHub users. First name references like @andy, @arjen, @brian colliding with GitHub user names were also common at some point, and all of those are a huge nuisance in an import of 17K+ issues with comments. This is why we've taken care to escape them. Going forward, when creating new issues or comments, please, be a good GitHub citizen and use backticks, e.g. `@Foo` (yes, <https://github.com/foo> does exist).

# Background

---

I've used and liked Jira for a long time. The idea of migrating to GitHub Issues did not come to me immediately. It seemed too basic by comparison. What turned me around completely has little to do with a feature-by-feature comparison, although I must admit GitHub Issues has really grown on me since the move. What I'm hinting at are larger forces at work.

GitHub is the home of just about every open source project, including *every* Spring project, and all users can be reasonably expected to have GitHub credentials. As a result it has become untenable today to expect developers to maintain a separate login for the issue tracker of every open source project they depend on or want to report an issue against.

Then there are the benefits of co-locating source code and issues. I've mentioned many of those earlier, like the [autolinked references](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/) across issues, pull requests, source code and commits, within a single project and across all projects on GitHub. The ability to mention and notify any GitHub user. All of those are very powerful benefits that are simply not possible with siloed issue tracking. I doubt anyone wants to go back to the days when open source projects were hosted in different places. The same is true for issue tracking.

There are deeper, less obvious benefits for co-located source code and issues. GitHub treats issues and pull requests as equal. They are assigned numbers from the same sequence. They look the same (description, comments, labels, and target milestone). They appear in release notes without distinction. A pull request is nothing but an issue with commits attached.

Historically in the Spring Framework, we've insisted on a Jira issue for every pull request. We didn't like the burden either but we needed a single place of record for all issues. As a consequence of this split situation, it was never too clear what should be discussed under the pull request and how much belongs in the Jira issue.

Going forward this is no longer a problem. We expect either an issue or a pull request, not both. If you need to start with a discussion first, which we *do* encourage, create an issue, and later, if you submit a pull request, the PR will supersede the issue. The two are linked still and nothing is lost. The conversation simply follows the action.

Not to be overlooked is the markup question. There is no doubt in my mind that Wiki markup is painful for code related discussions. I've used it for years on a daily basis. I'm used to it but some things are just hard, and require too much effort. Here is a reminder of what it takes to display something as common as curly braces and asterisks in code snippets:
`{{/endpoint/\{server-id\}/\{session-id\}/\{transport/\*\}}}`.

There is no question that Markdown is easier for code related comments. It requires less typing and it just works when it comes to formatting code because it's simpler and does not clash with symbols that commonly appear in code. This has looked obvious to me from the start, since I've also used GitHub and Markdown in parallel for years too. I never understood why Jira still doesn't support Markdown. To be clear this wasn't a decisive factor. It's just one of those things you learn to live with that later can become extra incentive for change.

Last but not least, today most developers use Spring through Spring Boot which has always used GitHub Issues. From that perspective alone, there is enough incentive for the Spring Framework to migrate, since Spring Boot isn't about to migrate to Jira, and that would be the only other way to create a more consistent experience for Spring users.

# The Actual Migration

---

Despite a lot of preparation there is nothing like the day of the actual migration. We used GitHub's unofficial [import API](https://gist.github.com/jonmagic/5282384165e0f86ef105) which is documented to not trigger any notifications. We hadn't noticed any problem with that during testing. Once the actual migration started, notifications for every issue and every comment started pouring in.

We began to reach out to GitHub support using every available channel available. Fortunately for us they noticed too. How could they not? By my estimate, the 2,600 issues that were imported before we pulled the breaks must have generated tens of millions of emails, not surprisingly causing notification disruptions.

A day later, after GitHub support had corrected the issues and turned off all notifications for the Spring Framework project to be on the safe side, we were onto a smoother path to importing all issues over the course of 8-9 hours. It took another few hours to make a second pass over all issues and comments, to replace Jira issue keys with GitHub reference numbers, and then several more days to check and clean up markup conversion issues.

All of that is now complete, and it is my pleasure to announce we are now open for business on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues).

Package        : libspring-java
Version        : 3.0.6.RELEASE-17+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3578 CVE-2014-3625 CVE-2015-3192 CVE-2015-5211
                 CVE-2016-9878
Debian Bug     : 760733 769698 796137 849167

Vulnerabilities have been identified in libspring-java, a modular
Java/J2EE application framework.

CVE-2014-3578

    A directory traversal vulnerability that allows remote attackers to
    read arbitrary files via a crafted URL.

CVE-2014-3625

    A directory traversal vulnerability that allows remote attackers to
    read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors, related to static
    resource handling.

CVE-2015-3192

    Improper processing of inline DTD declarations when DTD is not
    entirely disabled, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory consumption and out-of-memory errors) via a
    crafted XML file.

CVE-2015-5211

    Reflected File Download (RFD) attack vulnerability, which allows a
    malicious user to craft a URL with a batch script extension that
    results in the response being downloaded rather than rendered and
    also includes some input reflected in the response.

CVE-2016-9878

    Improper path sanitization in ResourceServlet, which allows
    directory traversal attacks.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.0.6.RELEASE-17+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-java packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
6.1.0. It includes bug fixes, which are documented in the readme.txt file
included with the patch files. The following security issues are addressed
in this release:

It was found that Apache WSS4J (Web Services Security for Java), as used by
Apache CXF with the TransportBinding, did not, by default, properly enforce
all security requirements associated with SAML SubjectConfirmation methods.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform various types of spoofing
attacks on web service endpoints secured by WSS4J that rely on SAML for
authentication. (CVE-2014-3623)

A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Spring Framework
sanitized certain URLs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain any
file on the file system that was also accessible to the process in which
the Spring web application was running. (CVE-2014-3625)

Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
installation instructions.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
security update.
