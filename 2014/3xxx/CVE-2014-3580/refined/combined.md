=== Content from subversion.apache.org_af2ac7df_20250126_015532.html ===
 Credentials cached with Subversion may be sent to the wrong server.
Summary:
========
Subversion's credentials cache uses a MD5 hash in order to index and then
lookup cached credentials. MD5 is subject to hash collisions and as such
it may be possible to engineer a server to get Subversion to send it
credentials that have been cached for a different server. This can lead to
the leaking of these credentials to a 3rd party.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion clients 1.0.0 through 1.7.17 (inclusive)
Subversion clients 1.8.0 through 1.8.9 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.18
Subversion 1.8.10
Details:
========
Subversion stores cached credentials by an MD5 hash based on the URL and
the authentication realm of the server the credentials are cached for. MD5
has been shown to be subject to chosen plaintext hash collisions. This
means it may be possible to generate an authentication realm which results
in the same MD5 hash for a different URL.
Subversion supports storage of the credentials in a variety of ways (e.g.
Windows Crypto API, KWallet, Gnome-Keyring, and the OS X Keychain) as well
as its own built in storage. This vulnerability applies to all of them
since the same hash key is used to store the credentials in all of them.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N
We consider this to be a very low risk vulnerability. Exploiting this
vulnerability in practice will be very difficult. Calculating such a
collision with the current public known techniques for producing an MD5
collision (e.g chosen prefix attacks) requires control of the authentication
realm on the real server the credentials are for. Typically if you have
access to modify the authentication realm you already have more access than
the credentials can gain you or can log credentials in other less visible
ways.
However, it is possible that other techniques are unknown to the public or
will become known in the future that allow MD5 pre-image attacks such that
the attacker does not need to change the authentication realm on the real
server.
Even once an attacker has calculated an authentication realm for the server
they wish to steal credentials for they have to get the Subversion client
to connect to their server with this configuration in place. This would
likely require some social engineering to get a user to do this. However,
there would be nothing to indicate to the user that such a situation
was occurring.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.10. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
Users can avoid this problem by disabling authentication credential
storage via the 'store-auth-creds' setting in the '[global]' section
of the Subversion servers configuration file. See the SVN Book for
details on where to find these configuration files:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.confarea.html

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-15 02:46:01 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way mod_dav_svn handled URIs for virtual transaction names. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a request for a virtual transaction name that does not exist, causing mod_dav_svn to crash.  Versions 1.7.0 up to and including 1.7.18, and 1.8.0 up to and including 1.8.10, are affected.  This issue will be fixed in versions 1.7.19 and 1.8.11.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Subversion project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of VisualSVN as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-15 02:50:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 968772](attachment.cgi?id=968772&action=diff "1.7.18 patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=968772&action=edit "1.7.18 patch from upstream") 1.7.18 patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-15 02:50:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 968773](attachment.cgi?id=968773&action=diff "1.8.10 patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=968773&action=edit "1.8.10 patch from upstream") 1.8.10 patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c4)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-16 00:57:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2014-8108-advisory.txt>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-16 01:04:26 UTC  ```  Created subversion tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1174521](show_bug.cgi?id=1174521 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8108 CVE-2014-3580 subversion: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1174057#c7)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-05 07:39:09 UTC  ``` subversion-1.8.11-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

Package        : subversion
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3580
Debian Bug     : 773263

Evgeny Kotkov discovered a NULL pointer dereference while processing
REPORT requests in mod_dav_svn, the Subversion component which is used
to serve repositories with the Apache web server.  A remote attacker
could abuse this vulnerability for a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0166)

## Topic

Updated subversion packages that fix three security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
mod\_dav\_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access
to Subversion repositories via HTTP.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod\_dav\_svn module
handled REPORT requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use a
specially crafted REPORT request to crash mod\_dav\_svn. (CVE-2014-3580)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod\_dav\_svn module
handled certain requests for URIs that trigger a lookup of a virtual
transaction name. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a request
for a virtual transaction name that does not exist, causing mod\_dav\_svn to
crash. (CVE-2014-8108)

It was discovered that Subversion clients retrieved cached authentication
credentials using the MD5 hash of the server realm string without also
checking the server's URL. A malicious server able to provide a realm that
triggers an MD5 collision could possibly use this flaw to obtain the
credentials for a different realm. (CVE-2014-3528)

Red Hat would like to thank the Subversion project for reporting
CVE-2014-3580 and CVE-2014-8108. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of
VisualSVN as the original reporter.

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart the httpd
daemon, if you are using mod\_dav\_svn, and the svnserve daemon, if you are
serving Subversion repositories via the svn:// protocol.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_f4c7d39b_20250126_015531.html ===
 mod\_dav\_svn is vulnerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS
vulnerability with certain invalid REPORT requests.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it
receives a REPORT request for some invalid formatted special URIs.
This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this problem
being exploited in the wild.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.0.0 through 1.7.18 (inclusive)
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.10 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.19
Subversion 1.8.11
Details:
========
Subversion's HTTP support is implemented as an interaction between mod\_dav
and mod\_dav\_svn. mod\_dav asks mod\_dav\_svn to fill a resource struct when
a request is made. When the resource doesn't exist in the repository the
repository path is calculated as a NULL. Later mod\_dav calls into
mod\_dav\_svn to actually handle the request and Subversion attempts to
use the repostiory path which is NULL, resulting in the SEGFAULT.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Repositories which
allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.
Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod\_dav\_svn
servers are vulnerable.
A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache
servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
on other clients being served by the same process that services the
request from the attacker. In either case there is an increased
processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process
caches being lost.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.11. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
No known workarounds are available.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

 mod\_dav\_svn is vulnerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS
vulnerability for requests with no existant virtual transaction names.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it
receives a request for some invalid formatted special URIs.
This can lead to a DoS. There are no known instances of this problem
being exploited in the wild.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.18 (inclusive)
Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.10 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.19
Subversion 1.8.11
Details:
========
Subversion 1.7.0 and newer added new protocol variant to the HTTP support.
One of the changes in this new protocol was that the client no longer had
to generate the UUID by which transactions would be referred to. However,
there were circumstances where clients needed to provide their own names for
transactions and so it has support for virtual transaction names. These
transaction names are then mapped to the servers internal transaction id
much as was done in the old protocol. New special URIs were provided to
allow the client to access the transactions by these virtual transaction
names.
Making a request for a URI that refers to a non-existant virtual transaction
name results in the lookup for the internal transaction id to be NULL.
Subsequent uses of the transaction id do not properly validate that the
id is valid and result in a SEGFAULT.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Repositories which
allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.
Unfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod\_dav\_svn
servers that support the new protocol variant are vulnerable.
A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache
servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
on other clients being served by the same process that services the
request from the attacker. In either case there is an increased
processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process
caches being lost.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.11. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch.
New Subversion packages can be found at:

 mod\_dav\_svn is vulnerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS
vulnerability with certain invalid REPORT requests.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it

Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.19
Subversion 1.8.11
Details:
========
Subversion's HTTP support is implemented as an interaction between mod\_dav
and mod\_dav\_svn. mod\_dav asks mod\_dav\_svn to fill a resource struct when
a request is made. When the resource doesn't exist in the repository the
repository path is calculated as a NULL. Later mod\_dav calls into
mod\_dav\_svn to actually handle the request and Subversion attempts to
use the repostiory path which is NULL, resulting in the SEGFAULT.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P

Moderate: subversion security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0165)

## Topic

Updated subversion packages that fix two security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
mod\_dav\_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access
to Subversion repositories via HTTP.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod\_dav\_svn module
handled REPORT requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use a
specially crafted REPORT request to crash mod\_dav\_svn. (CVE-2014-3580)

It was discovered that Subversion clients retrieved cached authentication
credentials using the MD5 hash of the server realm string without also
checking the server's URL. A malicious server able to provide a realm that
triggers an MD5 collision could possibly use this flaw to obtain the
credentials for a different realm. (CVE-2014-3528)

Red Hat would like to thank the Subversion project for reporting
CVE-2014-3580. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of VisualSVN as the
original reporter.

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart the httpd
daemon, if you are using mod\_dav\_svn, and the svnserve daemon, if you are
serving Subversion repositories via the svn:// protocol.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
