  "CVE-2014-3580": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_dav_svn module handled REPORT requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use a specially crafted REPORT request to crash mod_dav_svn.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A missing sanity check in the code of subversion allows a crafted report request to cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to server crash. A remote unauthenticated attacker could crash the mod_dav_svn server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network access",
        "Specially crafted REPORT requests"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable server.",
        "No authentication needed for anonymous read access."
      ],
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in versions 1.0.0 up to and including 1.7.18, and 1.8.0 up to and including 1.8.10. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `dav_svn__get_deleted_rev_report` function when the repository path is not set or is NULL. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when calling `svn_path_join`."
