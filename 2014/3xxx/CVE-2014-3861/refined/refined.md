Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure handling of externally supplied C-CDA documents, specifically within the XSLT stylesheet (`CDA.xsl`) used for rendering these documents in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. The stylesheet, widely adopted by EHR vendors, contains vulnerabilities that allow malicious C-CDA documents to execute arbitrary JavaScript or leak sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unsanitized `nonXMLBody/text/reference/@value`**: The stylesheet uses the `value` attribute of the `<reference>` tag within a `nonXMLBody` to construct an iframe's `src` attribute without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript by providing a `javascript:` URI in the reference. (CVE-2014-3861)
2.  **Unsanitized `table/@onmouseover`**: The stylesheet copies all attributes of `table` elements directly into the output HTML.  If a C-CDA document includes attributes like `onmouseover`, it will be copied to the HTML output allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution on mouseover. (CVE-2014-5452)
3.  **Unsanitized `observationMedia/value/reference/@value`**: Similar to the first vulnerability, the stylesheet uses the `value` attribute of a `<reference>` tag inside an `observationMedia` element to construct the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag without sanitization. This allows an attacker to force the browser to load an external image. This can be exploited to leak the current URL by sending it in the HTTP referer header. (CVE-2014-3862)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the EHR's web application. This can lead to stealing browser cookies, application state, or other sensitive information. Attackers can also redirect the user to a different site.
*  **Information Leakage**: By using a malicious image reference, an attacker can force the browser to load an image from an external server, causing the browser to send the URL of the current page in the HTTP Referer header. This can leak private session state embedded in the URL to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted C-CDA Documents:**  The primary attack vector is through specially crafted C-CDA documents that contain malicious code or references in the vulnerable locations mentioned above. These documents can be introduced into an EHR system via normal document upload processes, external data exchange, etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify C-CDA Documents:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify C-CDA documents to include the malicious code or references.
*   **Access to EHR Systems:**  The attacker needs to be able to get these malicious documents into a target EHR system that is vulnerable to the XSLT stylesheet issues. This could be through various means depending on how the EHR receives data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions that the vulnerabilities affect many EHRs due to the widespread use of the default `CDA.xsl` stylesheet from HL7.
*  The post mentions that the author privately disclosed this to multiple vendors.
*   The post references a follow-up blog post detailing a real-world case, best security practices, and issues with vulnerability reporting protocols.
