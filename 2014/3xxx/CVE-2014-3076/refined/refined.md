Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A diagnostic page within the IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) product included detailed system information.
*   This page was accessible to anonymous (unauthenticated) users by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive system information was exposed.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The diagnostic page lacked proper security constraints, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to system information, which could be leveraged for further attacks or reconnaissance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker could access the vulnerable diagnostic page via the network without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the IBM BPM server to reach the diagnostic page. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is due to the exposure of a diagnostic page with system information to unauthenticated users, allowing unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. The fix involves adding security constraints to the application, requiring users to be mapped to a security role for access.
