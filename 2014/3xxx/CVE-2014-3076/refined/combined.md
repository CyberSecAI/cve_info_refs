# JR50760: SECURITY APAR CVE-2014-3076 - UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SYSTEM INFORMATION

## Fixes are available

[Version 8.5 Refresh Pack 6 for the IBM Business Process Manager products](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/582629)

[Version 8.5.0 Fix Pack 2 for the IBM Business Process Manager products](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/584917)

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  System information is disclosed to unauthorized users on a
  diagnostic page.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.0 and later versions embed a
  document management component that provides a diagnostic page
  with detailed system information. This page is available to
  anonymous users by default.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM 8.5.0.1 and 8.5.5.0 that adds a
  security constraint to the application that contains this page
  so that users must be mapped to a security role for access to
  this page. No manual application modification is required.
  Because this diagnostic page is not required in IBM BPM, a
  security role is reused that also protects other unused
  resources and, therefore, has no user or group mappings by
  default.

  On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
  for JR50760:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
    the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
    level, and your platform, and then click Continue.

  2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR50760, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
