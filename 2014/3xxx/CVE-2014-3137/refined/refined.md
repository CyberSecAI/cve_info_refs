Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a too permissive detection of JSON content by the Bottle web framework for Python. It improperly accepted content types that were not strictly `application/json`, such as `text/plain;application/json`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Content-Type Bypass:** The primary weakness was that Bottle's content type parsing logic was not strict enough, allowing content with manipulated headers (e.g. `text/plain;application/json`) to be treated as `application/json`.
*   **Security Mechanism Bypass:** This permissive parsing allowed attackers to bypass intended security mechanisms that rely on the correct `application/json` content type. For example, browser cross-origin request policies are dependent on correct content type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Origin Request Vulnerabilities:** An attacker could potentially bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protections in web browsers. For instance, a malicious site could make cross-origin requests to a vulnerable Bottle application using a manipulated content-type header that the browser would normally block for a standard `application/json` content-type. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user or steal sensitive data.
*   **Bypassing Security Checks:** By manipulating the content type, attackers could circumvent other security checks or filters in place that depend on accurate content type identification.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers would craft HTTP requests with a manipulated `Content-Type` header. For example, using a value such as `text/plain;application/json` instead of `application/json`.
*   **Cross-Origin Requests:** Attackers would initiate requests from a different origin than the target server using the manipulated content type, thereby bypassing browser-based security mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Bottle application. This would typically involve having control over a web browser or using a scripting environment.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of Bottle's relaxed content type parsing behavior to effectively exploit it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was first reported in the Bottle issue tracker #616
*   Patches were created for master, 0.11 and 0.12 branches.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the content-type is strictly `application/json` and not just contain `application/json`.
