Debian Security Advisory DSA-2948-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-bottle
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3137

It was discovered that Bottle, a WSGI-framework for Python, performed
a too permissive detection of JSON content, resulting a potential
bypass of security mechanisms.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.11-1+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1093255#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-01 04:26:09 UTC  ``` It was reported that the JSON content-type was not restrictive enough. Bottle treated "text/plain;application/json" as JSON, allowing attackers to bypass intended security mechanisms. From the upstream report, "For example Chrome will not allow cross-origin xmlhttprequests with the content type set to "application/json" but you can set it to "text/plain;application/json" instead and bottle will accept it.".  Upstream report: <https://github.com/defnull/bottle/issues/616>  Patches for master, 0.11, and 0.12, respectively:  <https://github.com/defnull/bottle/commit/7c3226867d9005903e268fedd819389ab8c6336d> <https://github.com/defnull/bottle/commit/a3c7b6eba63f41968c78ea61a2dd1bf334cff4b0> <https://github.com/defnull/bottle/commit/2589f5a808da9d0c2d153c379557e1a090acdf04>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1093255#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-01 04:28:00 UTC  ```  Created python-bottle tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1093257](show_bug.cgi?id=1093257 "CLOSED ERRATA - python-bottle: JSON content-type not restrictive enough [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1093255#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-01 04:34:47 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/01/10>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1093255#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-02 02:26:09 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-3137](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3137) to this issue:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/01/15>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1093255#c4)  Fedora Update System    2014-08-15 02:30:49 UTC  ``` python-bottle-0.12.6-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

## Description

[![@stephenR](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211645?v=4&size=48)](/stephenR)[stephenR](https://github.com/stephenR)opened [on Apr 24, 2014](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/issues/616#issue-32176736)

Hi,

There is a problem with the content-type parsing that was introduced in [#226](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/issues/226) .

Bottle will accept things like "text/plain;application/json" as a json content type which might be used by an attacker to bypass security mechanisms.

For example Chrome will not allow cross-origin xmlhttprequests with the content type set to "application/json" but you can set it to "text/plain;application/json" instead and bottle will accept it.

> <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746322> and

Use CVE-2014-3137.

The scope of this CVE does not include any behavior of Chrome that
could be interpreted as a Chrome vulnerability, e.g., "can make a
request with the content-type of text/plain;application/json (IMO this
is a bug in Chrome)" in 616. A later comment in 616 says "The original
reporter mentioned filing Chrome bugs." As suggested by the
<http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/> page, Chrome bugs are the
mechanism for getting CVE assignments from the Google CNA.
