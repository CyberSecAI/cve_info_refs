Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3853:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Pyplate application does not set the "Secure" flag on the "id" cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing "Secure" Flag on Cookie:** The application sets a cookie named "id" without the "Secure" flag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Without the "Secure" flag, the "id" cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections. This makes it vulnerable to interception by a MitM attacker. If the cookie is stolen by an attacker, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or impersonate the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network or in a position to intercept network traffic can capture the cookie if it's sent over HTTP. This can occur when the user accesses the site over a non-HTTPS connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic between the user and the server. This could be on the same local network or a position to intercept traffic in between (such as a rogue wifi hotspot).
*   **No Authentication Needed:**  The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the system. They only need to be able to capture network traffic to exploit the vulnerability.
