Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Cordova applications on Android handle intent URLs. Specifically, a specially crafted intent URL can force the Cordova-based application to load a different start page than intended by the developer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Application Scripting (XAS):** The primary weakness is that a malicious intent URL can redirect the application to load arbitrary HTML content stored on the Android device.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability indicates that the application is not sufficiently validating or sanitizing the intent URL, allowing for the redirection to the attacker controlled html.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By loading a different start page, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
- **Data theft:** An attacker could potentially steal data stored by the app or leak sensitive data.
- **Application takeover:** It can allow the attacker to take control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Intent URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted Android intent URL.
- **External Application Interaction:** The attacker needs a way to trigger this intent URL and redirect the application to their crafted HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious Intent URLs:** The attacker must be able to create a specially formatted intent URL that redirects the Cordova application.
- **Ability to trigger intent URL:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the target application to launch with the crafted intent URL.
- **Malicious HTML content:** The attacker needs to have created and stored malicious HTML content on the device in a location they know to target.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Cordova Android version 3.5.1.
- The content explicitly mentions that this vulnerability is a cross-application scripting issue.
