Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-3462:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Message Authentication Code (MAC) header verification in EncFS is controlled by settings within the `.encfs6.xml` configuration file. This file is part of the ciphertext and can be modified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **MAC disabling:** An attacker with read/write access to the ciphertext can disable MAC verification by setting `"blockMACBytes"` to 0 and adding 8 to `"blockMACRandBytes"` in the `.encfs6.xml` configuration file.
- **Insufficient MAC protection:** This effectively allows an attacker to modify the encrypted data without detection, as the MAC is no longer being checked.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data modification:**  An attacker can make arbitrary changes to the ciphertext, which would then be decrypted as modified plaintext. This could lead to data corruption or malicious manipulation of files stored within the encrypted file system.
- **Loss of integrity:** The primary purpose of MACs is to ensure data integrity, which is defeated by this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the ciphertext: The attacker needs read and write access to the encrypted data, including the `.encfs6.xml` configuration file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Read/write access:** The attacker needs read/write access to the ciphertext. This could happen if an attacker gains access to the encrypted files on a storage device, or through other means of accessing the ciphertext.
- **Ability to modify configuration file:** The attacker must be able to modify the `.encfs6.xml` configuration file directly, either through direct file access or other means.
