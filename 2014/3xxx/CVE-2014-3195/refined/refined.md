    "ID": "CVE-2014-3195",
    "description": "Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101, does not properly track JavaScript heap-memory allocations as allocations of uninitialized memory and does not properly concatenate arrays of double-precision floating-point numbers, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via crafted JavaScript code, related to the PagedSpace::AllocateRaw and NewSpace::AllocateRaw functions in heap/spaces-inl.h, the LargeObjectSpace::AllocateRaw function in heap/spaces.cc, and the Runtime_ArrayConcat function in runtime.cc.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper tracking of JavaScript heap-memory allocations as uninitialized memory and improper concatenation of arrays of double-precision floating-point numbers.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The V8 JavaScript engine does not properly manage memory allocations, leading to information leaks.",
        "Specific functions such as PagedSpace::AllocateRaw, NewSpace::AllocateRaw, LargeObjectSpace::AllocateRaw, and Runtime_ArrayConcat are vulnerable."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can obtain sensitive information.",
      "Attack vector": "Crafted JavaScript code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code."
    }
