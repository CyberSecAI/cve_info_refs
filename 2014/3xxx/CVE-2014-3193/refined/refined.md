```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SessionService::GetLastSession function in browser/sessions/session_service.cc in Google Chrome uses a base::Unretained pointer for a callback which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability if the SessionService is destroyed before the callback is processed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free",
    "Type confusion"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability through crafted web content that leverages \"type confusion\" during callback processing within the SessionService.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver crafted web content that can be loaded by the vulnerable browser."
