{
  "CVE-2014-3537": {
    "Description": "A local user with privileges of group=lp can write symbolic links in the rss directory and use that to gain '@SYSTEM' group privilege with cupsd. A local user with the 'lp' group privileges could use this flaw to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. It was discovered that CUPS allowed certain users to create symbolic links in certain directories under /var/cache/cups/.",
    "Root cause": "CUPS allows certain users to create symbolic links in certain directories under /var/cache/cups/.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of symlinks",
      "Insufficient permission checks",
      "Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-3537"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user with the 'lp' group privileges could use this flaw to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user can create symbolic links within the `/var/cache/cups/` directory, and then, through the CUPS web interface, can access those symlinked files.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local user with the `lp` group privileges."
