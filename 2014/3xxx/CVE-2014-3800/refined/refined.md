Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure storage of usernames and passwords in a plain XML file with world-readable permissions by XBMC (now Kodi).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** Usernames and passwords for services like WebDAV are stored in plaintext within the `sources.xml` file.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The `sources.xml` file is created with world-readable permissions (mode 0644), making it accessible to any user on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Any local user on the system can read the `sources.xml` file and obtain the stored usernames and passwords.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With the exposed credentials, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's remote services, such as WebDAV shares.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by any local user with read access to the file system where the `sources.xml` file is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where XBMC/Kodi is installed.
- No special privileges are needed to read the world-readable `sources.xml` file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected file is located at `~/.xbmc/userdata/sources.xml` (or `~/.kodi/userdata/sources.xml` for newer versions)
- The vulnerability was initially reported in XBMC, but later it was found to affect Kodi as well since it is a continuation of the project.
- The severity was initially set to "grave" but later reduced to "important".
- A fix was released in `xbmc 2:13.2+dfsg1-5`.
