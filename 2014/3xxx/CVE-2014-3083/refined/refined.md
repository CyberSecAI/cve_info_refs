**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application. Authentication is not required.

**Affected versions:**
- IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions 8.5, 8.5 Liberty Profile (if the Portlet Container feature is installed from the WASdev Liberty Repository), 8, and 7 are affected.

**Remediation:**
- Apply the specified Fix Pack, PTF, or Interim Fix as detailed in the document for the affected WebSphere Application Server versions.
