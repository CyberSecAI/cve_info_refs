Also according to the rope code (base/oi/doa.py, lines 113-117) , if port 3037 is taken already - rope will try to bind to 3038, 3039 and so on - so there's even no 100% guarantee that the port will be static.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1116485#c1)  Matěj Cepl    2015-02-11 21:38:23 UTC  ``` At least some fix for this was suggested in <https://github.com/python-rope/rope/pull/107> upstream.  It doesn't resolve the issue, but at least users who want to use DOA should be intentional about it and they should be warned against possible security risks.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1116485#c2)  Matěj Cepl    2015-02-11 21:39:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 990653](attachment.cgi?id=990653&action=diff "suggested patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=990653&action=edit "suggested patch") suggested patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1116485#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-07 19:38:04 UTC  ```  Created python-rope tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1240804](show_bug.cgi?id=1240804 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3539 python-rope: pickle.load of remotely supplied data with no authentication required [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1116485#c4)  nicks    2019-06-28 10:47:46 UTC  ``` This issue was fixed as of rope 0.11.0.  <https://github.com/python-rope/rope/pull/251>   ``` |  |
