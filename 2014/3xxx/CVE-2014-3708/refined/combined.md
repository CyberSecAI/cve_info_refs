| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1174422#c5)  Yogev Rabl    2015-04-12 09:01:57 UTC  ``` I'm not sure about how the system defines a failed compute.  The scenario I've tested is:  1. stopped the services openstack-nova-compute or libvirtd 2. tried to evacuate an instance  With both options the system response to the evacuation was:  ERROR: Compute service of <host name> is still in use.   Eoghan, How can I change the status of the Compute?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174422#c6)  Pádraig Brady    2015-04-13 11:38:27 UTC  ``` Please ensure the openstack-nova-api service is stopped   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1174422#c7)  Eoghan Glynn    2015-04-13 12:25:51 UTC  ``` After discussing on IRC, the conclusion is:   * nova-api service should not be shut down, as the POST /v2/​{tenant_id}​/servers/​{server_id}​/evacate call must be mediated by the service for each VM on the old node   * shutting down nova-compute service should suffice, but in realistic example reproducing this issue, the entire compute node was powered-down   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1174422#c8)  Yogev Rabl    2015-04-14 12:47:43 UTC  ``` verified on RHEL 7, Nova version:   openstack-nova-common-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-novncproxy-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch python-novaclient-2.17.0-4.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-console-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-conductor-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-cert-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch python-nova-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-compute-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-api-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch openstack-nova-scheduler-2014.1.4-3.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1174422#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 14:35:04 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0844)

## Topic

Updated OpenStack Compute (nova) packages that fix three security issues,
several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

It was discovered that the OpenStack Compute (nova) console websocket did
not correctly verify the origin header. An attacker could use this flaw to
conduct a cross-site websocket hijack attack. Note that only Compute setups
with VNC or SPICE enabled were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0259)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)
looked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with
sufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of
VMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an
extended amount of time. (CVE-2014-3708)

A flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could
allow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the
resize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all
available resources on the system. (CVE-2014-8333)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting the
CVE-2015-0259 and CVE-2014-3708 issues. Upstream acknowledges Brian
Manifold of Cisco and Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original reporters of
CVE-2015-0259, and Mohammed Naser from Vexxhost as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-3708.

In addition to the above issues, this update also addresses several bugs
and adds various enhancements, which are documented in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Technical Notes (see References
section).

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 6 runs on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.6.

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 6 Release
Notes (see References section) contain the following:

* An explanation of the way in which the provided components interact to

form a working cloud computing environment.

* Technology Previews, Recommended Practices, and Known Issues.
* The channels required for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5

for RHEL 6, including which channels need to be enabled and disabled.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1170558#c0)  Pádraig Brady    2014-12-04 10:31:05 UTC  ``` Due to the non handling of exceptions generated in this case, the live migration can get stuck in the migrating state.  The upstream commit is for Juno but this impacts RHOS5 due to our backport for [bug 1110367](show_bug.cgi?id=1110367 "CLOSED ERRATA - live migration failed due to no shared storage when using rbd imagebackend")   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1170558#c6)  nlevinki    2015-04-16 07:12:21 UTC  ``` this ticket was verified with RHOS5-RHEL7, see ticket #1191696 We run automation on this image, no issues were found. As agreed we will move this ticket to verify   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1170558#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 14:33:19 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0844.html>   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Hi,

On a customer install which has approximately 500 VMs in the system, running the following will hang:

nova list --ip 199

What will happen afterwards is that the nova-network process will stop responding for a while, a trace shows that it's receiving a huge amount of data. Upon further investigation, it looks like the issue maybe the right here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/icehouse/nova/network/manager.py#L420>

On this installation:

nova=> select count(\*) from virtual\_interfaces;

 count

-------

 11985

(1 row)

So with 1 run, we're sending almost 12K records to a single nova-network process which takes up a huge CPU load (and blocks it from doing anything else).

What ends up happening is other things start timing out in the system, such as resizes and new deployments:

As the comment in the linked code indicates, that method is not going to work well for large amounts of data. The worst bottleneck is probably going to be the length of time it takes to complete the sql query and retrieve the data. Unfortunately the mysql library used by Nova blocks when it makes a call, so everything stops in that process for the time it takes to complete. But there should be one nova-network process per CPU of the machine it's running on, so even when one is blocked work can continue on the others. And though the processing after retrieving the data will be CPU intensive, it should not prevent work in other processes or greenthreads from continuing.

But, multiple queries could tie up all of the nova-network processes and lead to a degradation of services. In short, I think there is potential for a DoS here.

One way to address this would be to add a policy check around the use of the ip filters so they could be effectively disabled. In order to have this call work without causing issues some rethinking of how this filtering is accomplished is going to need to happen.

Just an FYI to add on this, there is no way to have multiple nova-network processes (at least no simple way to do it).

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/cmd/network.py>

The service has no "workers" configuration, unlike services like the conductor...

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/cmd/conductor.py>

It is possible to launch multiple instances but typically I don't think a cloud operator has reason to think that nova-network requires launching many instances.. it is (implied) to be a fairly quiet/low CPU consuming process.

Also, an alternative which seems fairly trivial to implement is requesting a filtered list from nova-conductor. That way, only "matched" search results are sent across.

Unfortunately it is not a trivial thing to get a filtered list of instance uuids filtered by ip. The filtering for instances is somewhat complex and we don't want to duplicate that in the ip query. One potential approach would be to get a list of instance uuids not filtered by ip, and then send that to the network query to pare it down by ip filtering.

I think the easiest approach would be to put some policy in place around that filtering option to address the potential for a DOS and then the querying can be optimized later.

Unfortunately it is not a trivial thing to get a filtered list of instance uuids filtered by ip. The filtering for instances is somewhat complex and we don't want to duplicate that in the ip query. One potential approach would be to get a list of instance uuids not filtered by ip, and then send that to the network query to pare it down by ip filtering.

I think we can change this to grab all instances and then filter locally based on the ip information in the instance info cache. This will take nova-network out of the picture and minimize the network traffic. Working on a solution now.

The above solution will still be expensive if trying to filter all instances in the system, but that would only be available to admins so I think it avoids the security issue.

Can it take into account if the all\_tenants flag is provided?

That way it will work both for normal users for their own accounts and admins can search all tenants with --ip, similar to how --name works

nova list --name <x> will just search your tenant

nova list --name <x> --all-tenants will search all tenants

Patch applies cleanly to master and looks good to me. The patch applies cleanly to stable/icehouse but doesn't work without rework (the patch uses objects).

I'm undecided if we should backport this or not and would appreciate other people's thoughts on this -- the DoS is only available to authenticated users and has been out there in code we've marked as deprecated for a very long time. Is it really worth backporting this fix?

@Michael Still, a security vulnerability requires backports to supported stable releases in order to warrant an advisory (OSSA). Since Havana entered end of life, only Icehouse is now supported.

Considering the effectiveness of this attack, I think we should work on a backport. However, since Juno release is comming really fast, we should also consider if this bug really worth an embargoed disclosure. Note that if we keep the embargo the disclosure process requires 3 business days before fixes can be submitted to gerrit.

I guess it boils to the difficulty of this rework and if someone is available to do it.

@Vish: Thanks again for the feedback!

About the Havana patch, we could probably includes it in the advisory, at the condition Havana tests are still running in OpenStack gate. Else jenkins won't be able to verify it and thus we shouldn't ship it in my opinion.

Then about the impact description, is this new version enough to cover the Neutron impact ?

There's a few potential issues with the fix, the main one being that the info\_cache is potentially up to a minute out of date. The second issue being that this doesn't work with cells. I don't think either of these is a real problem, and certainly not large enough to block a security fix. I'm +2 on the patches.

I've updated the patch for master and Juno and this is passing tests for me. There was a test relying on the old ip filtering and it needed to be updated. Will get an Icehouse version together as well.

Fixes DOS issue in instance list ip filter

Converts the ip filtering to filter the list locally based

    on the network info cache instead of making an extremely expensive

    call over to nova network where it attempts to retrieve a list

    of every instance in the system.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0843)

## Topic

Updated OpenStack Compute (nova) packages that fix three security issues,
several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

It was discovered that the OpenStack Compute (nova) console websocket did
not correctly verify the origin header. An attacker could use this flaw to
conduct a cross-site websocket hijack attack. Note that only Compute setups
with VNC or SPICE enabled were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0259)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)
looked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with
sufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of
VMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an
extended amount of time. (CVE-2014-3708)

A flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could
allow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the
resize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all
available resources on the system. (CVE-2014-8333)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting the
CVE-2015-0259 and CVE-2014-3708 issues. Upstream acknowledges Brian
Manifold of Cisco and Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original reporters of
CVE-2015-0259, and Mohammed Naser from Vexxhost as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-3708.

In addition to the above issues, this update also addresses several bugs
and adds various enhancements, which are documented in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Technical Notes (see References section).

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

### Bug Description

Hi,

On a customer install which has approximately 500 VMs in the system, running the following will hang:

nova list --ip 199

What will happen afterwards is that the nova-network process will stop responding for a while, a trace shows that it's receiving a huge amount of data. Upon further investigation, it looks like the issue maybe the right here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/icehouse/nova/network/manager.py#L420>

On this installation:

nova=> select count(\*) from virtual\_interfaces;

 count

-------

 11985

(1 row)

So with 1 run, we're sending almost 12K records to a single nova-network process which takes up a huge CPU load (and blocks it from doing anything else).

What ends up happening is other things start timing out in the system, such as resizes and new deployments:

As the comment in the linked code indicates, that method is not going to work well for large amounts of data. The worst bottleneck is probably going to be the length of time it takes to complete the sql query and retrieve the data. Unfortunately the mysql library used by Nova blocks when it makes a call, so everything stops in that process for the time it takes to complete. But there should be one nova-network process per CPU of the machine it's running on, so even when one is blocked work can continue on the others. And though the processing after retrieving the data will be CPU intensive, it should not prevent work in other processes or greenthreads from continuing.

But, multiple queries could tie up all of the nova-network processes and lead to a degradation of services. In short, I think there is potential for a DoS here.

One way to address this would be to add a policy check around the use of the ip filters so they could be effectively disabled. In order to have this call work without causing issues some rethinking of how this filtering is accomplished is going to need to happen.

Just an FYI to add on this, there is no way to have multiple nova-network processes (at least no simple way to do it).

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/cmd/network.py>

The service has no "workers" configuration, unlike services like the conductor...

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/cmd/conductor.py>

It is possible to launch multiple instances but typically I don't think a cloud operator has reason to think that nova-network requires launching many instances.. it is (implied) to be a fairly quiet/low CPU consuming process.

Also, an alternative which seems fairly trivial to implement is requesting a filtered list from nova-conductor. That way, only "matched" search results are sent across.

Unfortunately it is not a trivial thing to get a filtered list of instance uuids filtered by ip. The filtering for instances is somewhat complex and we don't want to duplicate that in the ip query. One potential approach would be to get a list of instance uuids not filtered by ip, and then send that to the network query to pare it down by ip filtering.

I think the easiest approach would be to put some policy in place around that filtering option to address the potential for a DOS and then the querying can be optimized later.

I think we can change this to grab all instances and then filter locally based on the ip information in the instance info cache. This will take nova-network out of the picture and minimize the network traffic. Working on a solution now.

The above solution will still be expensive if trying to filter all instances in the system, but that would only be available to admins so I think it avoids the security issue.

Can it take into account if the all\_tenants flag is provided?

That way it will work both for normal users for their own accounts and admins can search all tenants with --ip, similar to how --name works

nova list --name <x> will just search your tenant

nova list --name <x> --all-tenants will search all tenants

Patch applies cleanly to master and looks good to me. The patch applies cleanly to stable/icehouse but doesn't work without rework (the patch uses objects).

I'm undecided if we should backport this or not and would appreciate other people's thoughts on this -- the DoS is only available to authenticated users and has been out there in code we've marked as deprecated for a very long time. Is it really worth backporting this fix?

@Michael Still, a security vulnerability requires backports to supported stable releases in order to warrant an advisory (OSSA). Since Havana entered end of life, only Icehouse is now supported.

Considering the effectiveness of this attack, I think we should work on a backport. However, since Juno release is comming really fast, we should also consider if this bug really worth an embargoed disclosure. Note that if we keep the embargo the disclosure process requires 3 business days before fixes can be submitted to gerrit.

I guess it boils to the difficulty of this rework and if someone is available to do it.

@Vish: Thanks again for the feedback!

About the Havana patch, we could probably includes it in the advisory, at the condition Havana tests are still running in OpenStack gate. Else jenkins won't be able to verify it and thus we shouldn't ship it in my opinion.

Then about the impact description, is this new version enough to cover the Neutron impact ?

@mnaser: sadly this is not schedule for Juno, thus not many coresec member have time to review this now.

Update should be excepted next week though.

Thanks for your patience...

There's a few potential issues with the fix, the main one being that the info\_cache is potentially up to a minute out of date. The second issue being that this doesn't work with cells. I don't think either of these is a real problem, and certainly not large enough to block a security fix. I'm +2 on the patches.

I've updated the patch for master and Juno and this is passing tests for me. There was a test relying on the old ip filtering and it needed to be updated. Will get an Icehouse version together as well.

Fixes DOS issue in instance list ip filter

Converts the ip filtering to filter the list locally based

    on the network info cache instead of making an extremely expensive

    call over to nova network where it attempts to retrieve a list

    of every instance in the system.
