{
  "CVE-2014-3708": {
    "Description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in OpenStack Nova when listing active servers using an IP filter. An authenticated user may overload the nova-network or neutron-server process, resulting in a denial of services.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to inefficient filtering in Nova's API when listing active servers by IP address, leading to excessive resource consumption when processing a large number of VMs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient data processing",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful attack could lead to denial of service (DoS) by overloading the nova-network or neutron-server process. This can impact the availability of the OpenStack cloud environment, potentially leading to service disruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the Nova API, where an authenticated user sends a request to list active servers using a specific IP filter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to use the Nova API, and the OpenStack installation must have a large number of VMs.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `nova-network` service, which is a single process.  The flaw is caused by `list_instances` method which queries against virtual interfaces table instead of filtering based on instances table. There is no mechanism for the service to create more workers."
