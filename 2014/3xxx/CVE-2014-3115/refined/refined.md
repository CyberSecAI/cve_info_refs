Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of whether a valid request was intentionally made by a user in Fortinet Fortiweb versions prior to 5.2.0. This lack of proper verification allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application does not properly validate if a request is legitimately coming from an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially trick an authenticated user into making unintended requests.
- These requests are treated as authentic, potentially leading to information leakage or code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out by inducing a logged-in user to visit a malicious website or open a specially crafted link (e.g., via URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest).
- The vulnerability is located in the `/system/config/adminadd` path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to induce an authenticated user of Fortiweb to interact with a malicious link or page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to Fortiweb.

**Additional Notes:**
- Fortinet Fortiweb 5.2.0 addresses this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by William Costa.
