Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the use of unsalted MD5 hashes for storing backend user passwords when salted passwords are not configured. This means the password hashes stored in the database can be directly used for authentication, without needing to reverse the hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-836:**  Use of a one-way hash without a salt.  This allows for the direct use of the hash to authenticate the user.
- **Authentication Bypass:**  An attacker who obtains the unsalted password hashes can directly use them to authenticate as a backend user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete Authentication Bypass:** An attacker with access to the unsalted MD5 password hashes can log in to the backend of the TYPO3 CMS as any user without needing the original passwords. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system with full admin access.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker gaining access to the backend could read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SQL Injection:** If an attacker performs a successful SQL injection attack, the password hashes stored in the database are exposed. They can then use these hashes to authenticate.
- **Database Access:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the database can retrieve the password hashes directly and use them to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Password Hashes:** The attacker needs to gain access to the unsalted MD5 hashes stored in the TYPO3 database.
- **Unsalted Password Setup:** The targeted TYPO3 instance must be configured to not use salted passwords. This is not the default configuration for versions >= 4.6 but older versions might be affected.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory explicitly mentions that the "can be used directly to authenticate" statement is the specific vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3945.
- It clarifies that the lack of salting being the default before 4.6 and mandatory before 6.2 are considered security improvements, not vulnerabilities, and are not assigned CVE IDs.
- The advisory notes that while password salting is enabled by default since TYPO3 4.6 and required since 6.2 for backend users, it was still possible to disable it for frontend users as of 6.2. This is strongly discouraged due to the security risk, but is not the focus of CVE-2014-3945.

In summary, CVE-2014-3945 specifically addresses the vulnerability in TYPO3 CMS where unsalted MD5 password hashes could be directly used for authentication, leading to a complete authentication bypass, where attacker has access to the password hashes.
