Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3981:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The PHP configure script used a predictable filename, `/tmp/phpglibccheck`, for a temporary file. This predictable filename allowed for a symlink attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insecure use of a predictable temporary file name.
- Vulnerability to symlink attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link to a sensitive file, potentially leading to overwriting or other malicious activity during the PHP configuration/compilation process. This would require a user compiling PHP source code.

**Attack vectors:**

- Local attack by exploiting the predictable filename `/tmp/phpglibccheck`.
- The attacker needs to create a symlink to a file they wish to manipulate, before the PHP configure script runs and creates the temporary file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have local access to the system where PHP is being configured or compiled.
- They must have the ability to create symbolic links in the /tmp directory.
- They need to be able to predict when a user will compile or configure PHP from source.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was reported on the Full Disclosure mailing list and to the PHP security team, but initially received no response from the PHP team.
-  The issue was fixed by replacing the hardcoded temporary file name with a call to `tmpnam(NULL)`. While this made it more difficult to predict, it wasn't the most secure method. The bug report suggests `mkstemp(3)` or `tmpfile(3)` would be better.
-  The vulnerability only affects users who compile PHP from source, not users of binary packages.
-  The vulnerability was addressed in OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and Security Update 2014-004 by updating PHP to version 5.4.30.
-  The vulnerability was also addressed in Oracle Solaris and OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and Security Update 2015-004 with updated versions of PHP.
