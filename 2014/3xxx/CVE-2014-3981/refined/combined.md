Use CVE-2014-3981 for this issue in PHP.

We probably can't make a CVE assignment for this because the primary
affected product is unknown, and this /tmp/ffiYFc1nZ observation might
already be covered by a previous CVE. Lynis apparently runs many other
scripts and programs; for example, there are hundreds of

  FIND=`

lines.

We can make a CVE assignment corresponding to your disclosure of this
lynis.$$ issue on oss-security. Use CVE-2014-3982. A CVE for this most
likely won't (or shouldn't) have a
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21> reference unless the
original fulldisclosure author confirms the association.

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

# More /tmp fun (PHP, Lynis)

---

*From*: A B <icanbenchpressmykeyboard () gmail com>

```
After reading about today's "Check, rootkit" vulnerability (CVE-2014-0476),
I thought I'd share these stupid bugs:

BUG #1 - PHP's ./configure script writes a predictable filename to /tmp
allowing for a symlink attack against the user running the script

```
> ```
> From PHP 5.5.13:
>
> ```

```

 18045 #include <stdio.h>
 18046 int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 18047 {
 18048   FILE *fp;
 18049   long position;
 18050   char *filename = "/tmp/phpglibccheck";
 18051
 18052   fp = fopen(filename, "w");
 18053   if (fp == NULL) {
 18054     perror("fopen");
 18055     exit(2);
 18056   }
 18057   fputs("foobar", fp);
 18058   fclose(fp);
 18059
 18060   fp = fopen(filename, "a+");
 18061   position = ftell(fp);
 18062   fclose(fp);
 18063   unlink(filename);
 18064   if (position == 0)
 18065   return 1;
 18066   return 0;
 18067 }

Reported to security () php net twice, no response ever received:
  September 22, 2012
  January 8, 2013

This issue goes back at least 10+ years, but no one configures/compiles PHP
as root and your files aren't important anyway.

BUG #2 - Lynis 1.5.4 (and presumably earlier) writes a predictable filename
to /tmp allowing for a symlink attack against the user running the script
Website: rootkit.nl

This utility, which is similar in nature to "chkrootkit" and "rkhunter" and
must be run as root, also writes a predictable filename to /tmp (you'll
have to win a race for this one). Unreported, because this is security
software. Therefore it is secure. (The logic is intentional. What's to
report?)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-06-05 07:13:23 UTC  ``` It was reported[1] to the full-disclosure mailing list that PHP's configure script uses a predictable filename in /tmp/, "/tmp/phpglibccheck". A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack against a user building the source RPM or running the configure script.  [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-06-05 07:15:42 UTC  ```  Created php tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1104981](show_bug.cgi?id=1104981 "CLOSED NOTABUG - php: insecure temporary file use in the configure script [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-06-05 07:57:30 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/05/14>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c3)  Remi Collet    2014-06-06 12:23:03 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-3981](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3981) PHP Bug: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67390> commit: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=91bcadd85e20e50d3f8c2e9721327681640e6f16>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-09 12:45:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Remi Collet from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c3)) > <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=91bcadd>  The above upstream commit replaced fixed file name with a tmpnam(NULL) call.  While this makes it harder to predict temporary file name, it does not fully block the issue.  Quoting tmpnam(3) man page for further details:    Although tmpnam() generates names that are difficult to guess, it is   nevertheless possible that between the time that tmpnam() returns a pathname,   and the time that the program opens it, another program might create that   pathname using open(2), or create it as a symbolic link. This can lead to   security holes. To avoid such possibilities, use the open(2) O_EXCL flag to   open the pathname. Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3)  I assume this make get an incomplete fix CVE if updates are released with the above fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1104978#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-09 12:57:30 UTC  ``` This problem is in the configure script, which is only executed when compiling PHP.  Therefore, this issue does not affect binary packages distributed as part of Red Hat products (or Fedora), and has no impact on customer deployments.  This can only affect users rebuilding php packages from source.  There is no plan to release Red Hat Security Advisory for this issue.  Future product versions, based on fixed upstream PHP versions, are likely to contain the fix in their source code.  Statement:  This issue did not affect binary PHP packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.   ``` |  |
