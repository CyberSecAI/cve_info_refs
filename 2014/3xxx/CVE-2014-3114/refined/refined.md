The provided content is related to CVE-2014-3114.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the 'cmd' parameter in the `ezpz-archive-cmd.php` file of the EZPZ One Click Backup WordPress plugin. The `exec` function is directly called with the unsanitized input, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The plugin directly executes user-supplied input as an operating system command without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the `ezpz-archive-cmd.php` file, providing an attacker-controlled command in the 'cmd' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication and can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress installation.
