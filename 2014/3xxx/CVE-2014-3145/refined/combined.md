filter: prevent nla extensions to peek beyond the end of the message[ Upstream commit 05ab8f2647e4221cbdb3856dd7d32bd5407316b3 ]
The BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR and BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extensions fail to check
for a minimal message length before testing the supplied offset to be
within the bounds of the message. This allows the subtraction of the nla
header to underflow and therefore -- as the data type is unsigned --
allowing far to big offset and length values for the search of the
netlink attribute.
The remainder calculation for the BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension is
also wrong. It has the minuend and subtrahend mixed up, therefore
calculates a huge length value, allowing to overrun the end of the
message while looking for the netlink attribute.
The following three BPF snippets will trigger the bugs when attached to
a UNIX datagram socket and parsing a message with length 1, 2 or 3.

Fix the first issue by ensuring the message length fulfills the minimal
size constrains of a nla header. Fix the second bug by getting the math
for the remainder calculation right.

# USN-2263-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Salva Peir√≥ discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1450-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1450.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1450.69)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

* CVE-2014-3145

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-04-13 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension implementation in the sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 uses the reverse order in a certain subtraction, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (over-read and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr\_nest function before the vulnerability was announced.

See more information about CVE-2014-3145 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3145) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3145)

# USN-2261-1: Linux kernel (Saucy HWE) vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-saucy](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-saucy) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Saucy

## Details

Salva Peir√≥ discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-24.41~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-24.41~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Android Security Bulletin‚ÄîApril 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published April 03, 2017 | Updated August 17, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of April 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on March 06, 2017
or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android
Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-04-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-04-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    and 2017-04-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the April 05,
  2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2016_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application‚Äîno matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-04-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-04-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the April 01, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of April 05, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-04-01](#2017-04-01-details) and
[2017-04-05](#2017-04-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3144 CVE-2014-3145 CVE-2014-3153

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:

CVE-2014-3144 / CVE-2014-3145

    A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) via
    crafted BPF instructions.

CVE-2014-3153

    Pinkie Pie discovered an issue in the futex subsystem that allows a
    local user to gain ring 0 control via the futex syscall. An
    unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting
    in denial of service) or for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Details

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-366-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-366.80](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-366.80)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE-2014-3144

* [ULN](https://linux.oracle.com)¬†>
* [Oracle Linux CVE repository](https://linux.oracle.com/cve) ¬†>
* CVE-2014-3144

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-04-13 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The (1) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR and (2) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension implementations in the sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 do not check whether a certain length value is sufficiently large, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr and \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr\_nest functions before the vulnerability was announced.

See more information about CVE-2014-3144 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3144) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3144)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

filter: prevent nla extensions to peek beyond the end of the message

```
The BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR and BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extensions fail to check
for a minimal message length before testing the supplied offset to be
within the bounds of the message. This allows the subtraction of the nla
header to underflow and therefore -- as the data type is unsigned --
allowing far to big offset and length values for the search of the
netlink attribute.

The remainder calculation for the BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension is
also wrong. It has the minuend and subtrahend mixed up, therefore
calculates a huge length value, allowing to overrun the end of the
message while looking for the netlink attribute.

The following three BPF snippets will trigger the bugs when attached to
a UNIX datagram socket and parsing a message with length 1, 2 or 3.

Fix the first issue by ensuring the message length fulfills the minimal
size constrains of a nla header. Fix the second bug by getting the math
for the remainder calculation right.

# USN-2262-1: Linux kernel (Quantal HWE) vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-52-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-52.78~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-52.78~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Use CVE-2014-3144.

(The _NEST variant was introduced at a later time, but the affected
code is somewhat analogous, and the lack of an skb->len check for the
_NEST variant probably can't be considered an independent mistake
relative to the lack of an skb->len check in the earlier code.)

> The remainder calculation for the BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension is

Use CVE-2014-3145.

# USN-2264-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Salva Peir√≥ discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-24.41)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-24.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
