Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-3497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied strings in the `WWW-Authenticate` header value within the OpenStack Swift component. Specifically, the application fails to properly quote the realm value before including it in the response header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue. Because the `WWW-Authenticate` header value is not properly escaped or quoted, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the header. When the Swift server sends the 401 response to a client, this malicious code will be rendered by the client browser as if it originated from the Swift server's domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** The injected XSS can be used to perform a variety of client-side attacks. This includes modifying the content of a webpage served by the Swift server, stealing authentication tokens or cookies, performing phishing attacks, or redirecting the user to other malicious sites.
*   **Potential for Phishing:** By injecting malicious HTML, an attacker could create a fake login form, or billing page that looks like it belongs to the service to phish user credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution in Browser:** The injected JavaScript could execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, potentially leading to local network exploitation if the user has other vulnerabilities in their system or browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker tricks a Swift user into clicking on a specially crafted URL that will generate a 401 response from the Swift server. The malicious URL includes the attacker's payload in the realm part of the authorization information.
*   **HTTP Response Manipulation:** The vulnerability resides in how the server constructs the `WWW-Authenticate` header value within the 401 error response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the Swift server. They operate remotely.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Swift versions 1.11.0 to 1.13.1, specifically in the Icehouse release of OpenStack. The vulnerability was introduced after the Havana release, so the previous version is not affected.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves properly quoting the user-supplied realm value using `urllib2.quote()` in `swift/common/swob.py` to prevent code injection.
*   **Mitigation:**  Users of Swift should upgrade to the patched versions. The fix was included in the 2.0.0 release.
*   **Severity:** Although initially considered a critical issue, it was later re-evaluated to a medium-severity vulnerability.
