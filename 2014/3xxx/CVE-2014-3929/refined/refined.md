Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2014-3929:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default configuration file (`lg.conf`) for the "lg" software specifies the path `/var/www/.ssh` for storing SSH keypairs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure default configuration:** The default path `/var/www/` is commonly used as the web document root in many Linux distributions. This makes the SSH keypairs potentially accessible via the web server if not specifically restricted by web server configuration.
- **Lack of sufficient documentation:** The software README doesn't explicitly advise users to take additional security measures regarding the SSH keypairs storage location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Exposed SSH private keys:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the SSH private keys if the webserver is not correctly configured to prevent access to the keypair files, leading to unauthorized access to systems that use the compromised keys for authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based access:** If the webserver serves the `/var/www/` directory without proper restrictions, an attacker could directly access the private key files by navigating to the path of the private keys.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web server hosting the vulnerable software.
- **Knowledge of default path:** The attacker needs to know the default SSH keypair path defined in the software configuration (`/var/www/.ssh`).
- **Web server misconfiguration:** The webserver needs to be configured in a way that does not prevent access to files within the `/var/www/.ssh` directory.
