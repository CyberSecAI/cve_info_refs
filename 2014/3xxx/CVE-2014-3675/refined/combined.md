## Synopsis

Moderate: shim security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1801)

## Topic

Updated shim packages that fix three security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Shim is the initial UEFI bootloader that handles chaining to a trusted full
bootloader under secure boot environments.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found the way shim parsed certain
IPv6 addresses. If IPv6 network booting was enabled, a malicious server
could supply a crafted IPv6 address that would cause shim to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3676)

An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the way shim processed
certain Machine Owner Keys (MOKs). A local attacker could potentially use
this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2014-3677)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way shim parsed certain
IPv6 packets. A specially crafted DHCPv6 packet could possibly cause shim
to crash, preventing the system from booting if IPv6 booting was enabled.
(CVE-2014-3675)

Red Hat would like to thank the SUSE Security Team for reporting these
issues.

All shim users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Message-ID: <20141013124951.GA5763@suse.de>
Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2014 14:49:51 +0200
From: Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer@...e.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: shim RCE

Hi

As per policy-request, here is the oss-posting of what has
formerly been negotiated on distros@. Initial CRD was Oct 6th
but has been shellshokshifted to today upon request.

--

We reviewed some parts of the shim trusted bootloader.
Shim is responsible for verifying of - and chaining into - a
next level bootloader. Shim itself is signed by MS so it can
be loaded by UEFI secure boot aware boards.
These vulnerabilities could be exploited to bypass
"secure boot" with leverage up to OS level.

We found three issues that should be fixed:

1. OOB read access when parsing DHCPv6 packets (remote DoS).
   The severity is low. (CVE-2014-3675)
2. Heap overflow when parsing IPv6 addresses provided by tftp:// DHCPv6
   boot option (RCE).
   The severity is low to medium, as secure boot via PXE6 should
   rarely be seen ITW. Furthermore UEFI firmware seems to fail
   to properly verify provided PXE images at the first place. (CVE-2014-3676)

For both issues above there is a patch proposal:

<http://suse.com/~krahmer/priv/shim1.diff>

3. Memory corruption when processing user provided MOK lists.
   Its unclear whether this could lead to a code execution in
   the secure boot path. (CVE-2014-3677)

For this issue there is also a patch proposal:

<http://suse.com/~krahmer/priv/shim2.diff>

All three issues should receive a CVE each. We ask for a CRD
of Oct 6th. 2014.

When updating, vendors should also take care to include
git commit 45ab8962ae7c8e860a45d195cfe8a3f4d8aec4c7 since this
already fixes another overflow (different from 2.) when parsing
DHCPv6 packets.

We did _not_ conduct a full code review of shim. In particular
PE header parsing and relocating of PE EFI images is left untouched.

Upstream maintainers have been informed already, as well as MS
to initiate the signing process of a patched shim.

It's unfortunate for Open Source vendors to rely on a third party
being a milestone in an update process since its adds hereto
a lot of complexity in the coordination and updating process.

Sebastian

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1148230#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-01 02:39:31 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in shim when IPv6 network booting was enabled. A specially-crafted DHCPv6 packet could possibly cause shim to crash, preventing the system from booting.  Note that performing a secure boot over the network is not a common scenario.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1148230#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-01 02:57:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 942902](attachment.cgi?id=942902&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=942902&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1148230#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-14 03:59:32 UTC  ``` Public now:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/311>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1148230#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-14 04:02:33 UTC  ```  Created shim tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1152388](show_bug.cgi?id=1152388 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3676 CVE-2014-3677 CVE-2014-3675 shim: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1148230#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-11-01 17:07:36 UTC  ``` shim-0.8-1.fc22, shim-signed-0.8-1.fc22, mokutil-0.2.0-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.
