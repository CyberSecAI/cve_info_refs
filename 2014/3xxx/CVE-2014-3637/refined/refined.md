  "CVE-2014-3637": {
    "description": "The DBus service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24 fixing security issues and bugs.\n\nUpstream changes since dbus 1.6.8\n\n- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling after a new configurable limit, pending_fd_timeout (defaulting to 150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular reference to a connection's file descriptor.",
    "root_cause": "A malicious process can create D-Bus connections that persist after the process that created them has terminated by attaching the file descriptor of a D-Bus connection to a D-Bus message and sending that message via the dbus-daemon.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime (CWE-775)"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. This exacerbates various patterns of undesirable/abusive behaviour by making it impossible to terminate them by killing processes. Can lead to resource exhaustion (file descriptors) on the dbus-daemon.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local attacker can create D-Bus connections to dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the participating processes."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is addressed by closing any connection that has incoming file descriptors queued for deserialization for more than a configurable timeout (defaulting to 2.5 minutes or 150 seconds)."
