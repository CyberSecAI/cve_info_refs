Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3418

**Vulnerable Software:** Infoblox Network Automation (NetMRI, Switch Port Manager, Automation Change Manager, Security Device Controller)

**Vulnerable Versions:** 6.4.X.X - 6.8.4.X

**Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the `skipjackUsername` POST parameter.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can inject operating system commands as the root user.
*   This can lead to complete compromise of the operating system.
*   Attackers could gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through an unauthenticated HTTP POST request to `netmri/config/userAdmin/login.tdf`.
*   The malicious payload is placed in the `skipjackUsername` parameter within the `multipart/form-data` POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable system.
*   No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize the input provided via the `skipjackUsername` parameter.
*   An attacker can insert shell commands within the `skipjackUsername` value by using backticks, e.g., `admin`ping -n 20 127.0.0.1``
*   The injected command will be executed with root privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   A Metasploit module has been created to exploit this vulnerability, available at: `https://github.com/depthsecurity/NetMRI-2014-3418`
*   Infoblox released a hotfix to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the 6.8.5 release.
