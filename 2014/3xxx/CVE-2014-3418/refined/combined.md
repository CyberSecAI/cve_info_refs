### What our Clients have to Say

“

Working with Depth was a real pleasure. Your PEN testing team was very thorough, you found things that have been in the network for 12 years that 10 or so PEN tests didn’t find. That’s crazy.

Chief Information OfficerFinancial Institution“

Very receptive and quick in communications throughout. If I had set expectations, I’d say they were exceeded. What I do have from our experience is appreciation for your professionalism and effort.

Vice President of SecurityFinancial Institution“

You guys have been phenomenal for us. It’s pretty rare to find a vendor that consistently delivers a polished product anymore.

Director of Enterprise CybersecurityHealth System“

As usual your team was outstanding to work with. I told the team here that they would see what a real Pen Testing partner can do. They were very impressed with the team and the work they did.

Chief Information Security OfficerHealthcare Organization“

The wealth of knowledge shared to improve our security posture continues to impress our team. The one plus that impresses our team is that we can reach out to inquiry about different security solutions in our environment to get your team’s feedback, which proves to be of great value. I have no recommendations to improve our experience or expectations.

Director of SecurityManufacturing Organization“

All of my engagements with Depth Security were met on time and within budget. I can confirm the professionalism, experience and wealth of knowledge they bring/display in the area of information security. I consider Depth Security a partner. You will be well served by any of their services. You will not be disappointed.

I will rate Depth Security a strong 5. Definitely recommended.

Response to a Client Reference Check“

I do want to say that the process with Depth has been great so far and we are very impressed with the detail and communication from Joe as well as the quality of the reports.

Director of Information TechnologySports & Recreation Organization“

We are satisfied with the thorough and detailed report. We also appreciated that your team worked independently without needing much of our time. It was a pleasure working with you, and we look forward to future opportunities.

Director of TechnologySoftware Organization“

We were very impressed and amazed by the services offered by your company. Your staff were very professional and were easy to work with and the reports were very well articulated and easy to understand. As a result of the audit, we have set in motion some policy changes specifically changing the password policy. It’s quite easy for companies like ours to be disconnected from the realities of the security realm and the audit helped us bridge that gap tremendously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------

Advisory Details:

Depth Security discovered a vulnerability in the Infoblox Network Automation management web interface. This attack does
not require authentication of any kind.

1) OS Command Injection in Infoblox Network Automation Products: CVE-2014-3418

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in in skipjackUsername POST parameter.
A remote attacker can inject operating system commands as the root user, and completely compromise the operating system.

The following is the relevant portion of the multipart/form-data POST request to netmri/config/userAdmin/login.tdf

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="skipjackUsername"

admin`ping -n 20 127.0.0.1`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Discovered and Provided: Nate Kettlewell, Depth Security ( https://www.depthsecurity.com/ )

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

Advisory Details:

Depth Security discovered a vulnerability in the Infoblox Network Automation management web interface. This attack does not require authentication of any kind.

1) OS Command Injection in Infoblox Network Automation Products: CVE-2014-3418

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in in skipjackUsername POST parameter. A remote attacker can inject operating system commands as the root user, and completely compromise the operating system.

The following is the relevant portion of the multipart/form-data POST request to netmri/config/userAdmin/login.tdf

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="skipjackUsername"

admin`ping -n 20 127.0.0.1`

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

Solution:

Infoblox immediately released a hotfix to remediate this vulnerability on existing installations (v6.X-NETMRI-20710.gpg).
The flaw was corrected in the 6.8.5 release (created expressly for dealing with this issue), and that release has been put into manufacturing for new appliances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

Proof of Concept:

In addition to manual exploitation via the above mentioned vector, proof of concept is provided in the form of a module for the metasploit framework.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
