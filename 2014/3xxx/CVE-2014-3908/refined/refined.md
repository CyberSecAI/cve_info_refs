Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Kindle App for Android fails to properly verify SSL server certificates. This means the app doesn't validate the authenticity of the server it's communicating with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Verification:** The application does not correctly validate the SSL certificates presented by the server. This could include not checking the certificate's validity period, the issuing authority, or whether the hostname matches the certificate.
*  **Missing or Inadequate Certificate Chain Validation:** It is implied that the app may not properly validate the entire chain of trust for the server certificate, possibly accepting self-signed or invalid certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept the communication between the Kindle app and the legitimate server.
*   **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the encrypted communication, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network. An attacker positioned on the network path between the app and the server can intercept the traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the user's device and the server. This could be achieved by:
    *   Being on the same Wi-Fi network as the user.
    *   Compromising a router or other network infrastructure.
    *   Using a rogue access point.
*   **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack, including the ability to present a forged certificate to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Kindle App for Android versions prior to 4.5.0.
*   The CVSS base score is 4.0, categorized as medium severity with network access, high complexity and no authentication required.
*   The provided documents indicate a vulnerability in the handling of SSL server certificates, which could lead to eavesdropping via a man-in-the-middle attack.
