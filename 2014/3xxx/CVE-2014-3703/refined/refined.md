Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-3703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `nova.conf` configuration file generated by PackStack did not correctly set the `libvirt_vif_driver` configuration option when the Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic plug-in was not utilized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect configuration of `libvirt_vif_driver` in `nova.conf` when OVS monolithic plug-in was not used.
- This resulted in deployments defaulting to having the firewall disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Security groups would fail to block traffic properly
- Deployments would have the firewall disabled by default.
- Unauthorized network traffic could potentially bypass security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation would occur during the deployment of OpenStack using PackStack.
- The vulnerability arises from a configuration issue in the `nova.conf` file generated by PackStack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would not require specific capabilities to exploit.
- Simply deploying OpenStack via packstack with a non-OVS monolithic plug-in configuration would be enough for the issue to occur.
- No user interaction would be required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yair Fried of Red Hat.
- The fix was released as part of Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2014:1691.
- The vulnerability is classified as having an "Important" security impact by Red Hat.
- The `libvirt_vif_driver` configuration was not being set correctly when the OVS monolithic plugin was not used.
