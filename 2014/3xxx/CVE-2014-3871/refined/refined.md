Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-3871:

**CVE-2014-3871:**

*   **Root Cause:** Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in GeoCore MAX DB version 7.3.3.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `b` parameter in `index.php` and the `c[username]` and `c[password]` parameters in `register.php`. The vulnerability is time-based, meaning that an attacker can infer information about the database by observing the delay caused by the `sleep()` function in the injected SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, application configurations, or other confidential data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `/index.php` with a crafted `b` parameter.
        *   Example: `/index.php?a=5&b=15 and sleep(2) &filterValue=1997&page=2&setFilter=cs_94`
    *   HTTP POST request to `/register.php` with a crafted `c[password]` or `c[username]` parameter.
        *   Example: POST data: `c[password]=secret"=sleep(2)="`
        *   Example: POST data: `c[username]=Esac"=sleep(3)="`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   No specific user privileges are required.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to observe the time taken for the server to respond to each crafted request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db entry provides detailed HTTP request/response examples illustrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The entry also mentions that Geocore is the new name for Geodesic Solutions software, which combines multiple products into a single offering.
*   The exploit is time-based which means that the attacker will infer information based on the time it takes for the response to return, making detection more difficult than traditional SQL injection attacks.
