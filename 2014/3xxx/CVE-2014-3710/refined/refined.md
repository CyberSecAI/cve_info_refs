    "description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in file's donote() function in the way the file utility determined the note headers of an ELF file. This could possibly lead to a file executable crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks on the note headers when processing ELF files, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a specially crafted ELF file.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, requiring the processing of a maliciously crafted ELF file.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted ELF file that will be processed by the vulnerable 'file' utility or other program using the vulnerable libmagic library."
