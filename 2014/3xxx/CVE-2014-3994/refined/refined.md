Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-3994:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `json_dumps` function in Djblets did not properly escape characters when serializing data to JSON for use within HTML context. Specifically, it failed to escape `<`, `>`, and `&` characters. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a JSON payload containing these characters that, when rendered in HTML, would break out of the intended context (e.g., `<script>` tags) and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper output sanitization/encoding when generating JSON for web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
- This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can manipulate user-controllable data that is serialized to JSON by the `json_dumps` function and rendered in HTML.
- This includes user display names, which may be used in a variety of contexts where `json_dumps` is used, such as in web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to influence the input data that is processed by the vulnerable `json_dumps` function.
- Ability to use the application to render the generated JSON within the context of a web page.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the `djblets.util.templatetags.djblets_js` module in the `json_dumps` function.
- The fix involves escaping `<`, `>`, and `&` characters using unicode escapes (`\u0026`, `\u003C`, `\u003E`) before injecting the JSON into the HTML.
- A test case was added to `djblets/util/templatetags/tests.py` to verify the fix, ensuring that XSS is not possible with the `json_dumps` function.

This vulnerability was discovered by "uchida" and assigned CVE-2014-3994. The fix was applied in Djblets versions 0.7.30 and 0.8.3.
