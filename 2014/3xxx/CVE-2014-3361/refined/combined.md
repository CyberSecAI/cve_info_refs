| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation (NAT) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper translation of IP version 4 (IPv4) packets.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-nat["https://tvce.cisco.com/security/AIMS/https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-nat"]
Note: The September 24, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html"]

Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software releases are vulnerable when configured with NAT and the NAT application layer gateway (NAT ALG) for multipart Session Description Protocol (SDP) in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been enabled. The NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled by default.
There are two methods to determine whether a Cisco IOS device is configured for NAT:
Determine whether NAT is active on a device
Determine whether NAT commands are included in the device configuration
The preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to determine whether NAT is active on a device.
One method is available to determine whether the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled.
Determine Whether NAT Is Active on a Device
To determine whether NAT is active on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, log in to the device and issue the show ip nat statistics command. If NAT is active, the "Outside interfaces" and "Inside interfaces" sections will each include at least one interface. The following example shows a device where NAT is active:
Router#show ip nat statistics
Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended)
Peak translations: 10, occurred 00:24:01 ago
Outside interfaces:
FastEthernet0/0
Inside interfaces:
FastEthernet0/1
Hits: 134280 Misses: 0
CEF Translated packets: 134270, CEF Punted packets: 10
Expired translations: 11
Dynamic mappings:
-- Inside Source
[Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0\_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0\_24 refcount 0

type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 0 (0%), misses 0
Total doors: 0
Appl doors: 0
Normal doors: 0
Queued Packets: 0
Router#
If no interfaces are listed on the output of the show ip nat statistics command, NAT may still be active on the device through the NAT Virtual Interface["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr\_nat/configuration/15-s/nat-15-s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html#GUID-1B07F018-EEE8-40AF-953E-7E674D5E4A23"] feature. To determine whether NAT is active through this feature, issue the show ip nat nvi statistics command. If NAT is active, the "NAT Enabled interfaces" section will include at least one interface. The following example shows a device where NAT is active:
Router#show ip nat nvi statistics
Total active translations: 1 (0 static, 1 dynamic; 1 extended)
NAT Enabled interfaces:
FastEthernet0/0, FastEthernet0/1
Hits: 81373 Misses: 3
CEF Translated packets: 44371, CEF Punted packets: 8
Expired translations: 3
Dynamic mappings:
-- Source [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0\_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0\_24 refcount 1
pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0\_24: netmask 255.255.255.0
start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128
type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 1 (11%), misses 0
Router#
Determine Whether NAT Commands Are Present in the Device Configuration
To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS Software configuration, log in to the device and issue the show running-config command. If NAT is active, the ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface commands must be present. Alternatively, in the case of the NAT Virtual Interface["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr\_nat/configuration/15-s/nat-15-s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html#GUID-1B07F018-EEE8-40AF-953E-7E674D5E4A23"], the ip nat enable interface command will be present.
Note: The Cisco Easy VPN Remote client feature configuration present on the device will automatically enable NAT. The NAT and Port Address Translation (PAT) configurations that are created by the Cisco Easy VPN Remote feature are not written to the startup or running configuration files. These configurations, however, can be displayed using the show ip nat statistics command.
Determine Whether the NAT ALG for Multipart SDP in SIP Is Enabled in the Device Configuration
For the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP traffic to be enabled on a Cisco IOS device running Cisco IOS Software, the ip nat service allow-multipart command must be present on the device configuration. The following example shows a device on which the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled:
Router#show running-config | include ip nat service allow-multipart
ip nat service allow-multipart
Router#
Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release on a Device
To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].

If the NAT feature is not configured on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, the device is not vulnerable. If the NAT feature is configured on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, but the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled, the device is not vulnerable.
The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:
Cisco IOS-XR Software
Cisco IOS-XE Software
Cisco NX-OS Software
Cisco ASA Software
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
A vulnerability in the application-layer gateway (ALG) module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
The vulnerability is due to how Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that require network address translation (NAT) are processed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to be processed and translated by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, leading to a DoS condition.
This vulnerability can be triggered when multipart SDP traffic (as defined in RFC 5621) undergoes NAT and the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled on the device. The NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled by default. This vulnerability can be triggered only by the traffic transiting an affected device and cannot be exploited with traffic destined to the device itself. This vulnerability cannot be exploited with IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCun54071["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun54071"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3361.
This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP. To disable the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP, use the no ip nat service allow-multipart in global configuration mode.
Note: Disabling the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP may negatively impact interoperability with third-party SIP gateways and devices.
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

The vulnerability is due to improper translation of IP version 4 (IPv4) packets.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software releases are vulnerable when configured with NAT and the NAT application layer gateway (NAT ALG) for multipart Session Description Protocol (SDP) in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been enabled. The NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled by default.      There are two methods to determine whether a Cisco IOS device is configured for NAT:   + Determine whether NAT is active on a device   + Determine whether NAT commands are included in the device configurationThe preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to determine whether NAT is active on a device.      One method is available to determine whether the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled.Determine Whether NAT Is Active on a DeviceTo determine whether NAT is active on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, log in to the device and issue the **show ip nat statistics** command. If NAT is active, the "Outside interfaces" and "Inside interfaces" sections will each include at least one interface. The following example shows a device where NAT is active: ```   Router#show ip nat statistics   Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended)   Peak translations: 10, occurred 00:24:01 ago   Outside interfaces:     FastEthernet0/0   Inside interfaces:      FastEthernet0/1   Hits: 134280  Misses: 0   CEF Translated packets: 134270, CEF Punted packets: 10   Expired translations: 11   Dynamic mappings:   -- Inside Source   [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24 refcount 0    pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24: netmask 255.255.255.0   start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128   type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 0 (0%), misses 0      Total doors: 0   Appl doors: 0   Normal doors: 0   Queued Packets: 0   Router#      ``` If no interfaces are listed on the output of the **show ip nat statistics** command, NAT may still be active on the device through the [NAT Virtual Interface](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-s/nat-15-s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html#GUID-1B07F018-EEE8-40AF-953E-7E674D5E4A23) feature. To determine whether NAT is active through this feature, issue the **show ip nat nvi statistics** command. If NAT is active, the "NAT Enabled interfaces" section will include at least one interface. The following example shows a device where NAT is active: ```   Router#show ip nat nvi statistics   Total active translations: 1 (0 static, 1 dynamic; 1 extended)   NAT Enabled interfaces:     FastEthernet0/0, FastEthernet0/1   Hits: 81373  Misses: 3   CEF Translated packets: 44371, CEF Punted packets: 8   Expired translations: 3   Dynamic mappings:   -- Source [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24 refcount 1    pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24: netmask 255.255.255.0   start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128   type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 1 (11%), misses 0   Router#      ``` Determine Whether NAT Commands Are Present in the Device ConfigurationTo determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS Software configuration, log in to the device and issue the **show running-config** command. If NAT is active, the **ip nat inside** and **ip nat outside** interface commands must be present. Alternatively, in the case of the [NAT Virtual Interface](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-s/nat-15-s-book/iadnat-addr-consv.html#GUID-1B07F018-EEE8-40AF-953E-7E674D5E4A23), the **ip nat enable** interface command will be present.      **Note:** The Cisco Easy VPN Remote client feature configuration present on the device will automatically enable NAT. The NAT and Port Address Translation (PAT) configurations that are created by the Cisco Easy VPN Remote feature are not written to the startup or running configuration files. These configurations, however, can be displayed using the **show ip nat statistics** command.Determine Whether the NAT ALG for Multipart SDP in SIP Is Enabled in the Device ConfigurationFor the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP traffic to be enabled on a Cisco IOS device running Cisco IOS Software, the **ip nat service allow-multipart** command must be present on the device configuration. The following example shows a device on which the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled: ```   Router#show running-config | include ip nat service allow-multipart   ip nat service allow-multipart   Router#      ``` Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release on a Device To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableIf the NAT feature is not configured on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, the device is not vulnerable. If the NAT feature is configured on a Cisco device running Cisco IOS Software, but the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled, the device is not vulnerable.      The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:   + Cisco IOS-XR Software   + Cisco IOS-XE Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the application-layer gateway (ALG) module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.       The vulnerability is due to how Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that require network address translation (NAT) are processed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to be processed and translated by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, leading to a DoS condition.      This vulnerability can be triggered when multipart SDP traffic (as defined in RFC 5621) undergoes NAT and the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is enabled on the device. The NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP is not enabled by default. This vulnerability can be triggered only by the traffic transiting an affected device and cannot be exploited with traffic destined to the device itself. This vulnerability cannot be exploited with IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCun54071](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun54071) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3361.  Workarounds  * This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP. To disable the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP, use the **no ip nat service allow-multipart** in global configuration mode.      **Note:** Disabling the NAT ALG for multipart SDP in SIP may negatively impact interoperability with third-party SIP gateways and devices.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.          Cisco IOS Software Cisco has provided a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the September 2015 bundled publication The tool will identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool will also return the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or simply enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether it is affected by any of the advisories in this bundled publication.
