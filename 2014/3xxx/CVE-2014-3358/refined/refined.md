Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-3358:

**Vulnerability:** Cisco IOS Software mDNS Gateway Memory Leak Vulnerability

*   **Root Cause:** Improper parsing of malformed mDNS packets sent to a Cisco IOS device.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The mDNS implementation in Cisco IOS Software does not properly handle malformed mDNS packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A memory leak condition on the affected device.
    *   This memory leak can eventually lead to an interface wedge (where packets are queued but not processed), and ultimately a device reload.
    *   A denial of service (DoS) condition due to the device reload/interface wedge.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An unauthenticated, remote attacker sends specially crafted, malformed mDNS packets to a vulnerable device.
    *   The packets must be destined for the device itself and cannot be exploited by simply transiting an affected device.
    *   The malformed UDP packets are sent to port 5353 using either IPv4/IPv6 unicast address of any interface configured on a device, IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.251, or IPv6 multicast address FF02::FB.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco device.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the infrastructure to craft mDNS packets with conditions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The mDNS Gateway functionality is enabled by default on Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.
*   Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is CSCuj58950.
*   A workaround is to configure an extended access control list (ACL) on the interface to block traffic destined to UDP port 5353.
*   Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can also be used to block untrusted UDP traffic to the device.
*   Cisco has provided an Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy to detect interface queue wedges caused by this vulnerability.
