Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3215:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the `capng_lock` function in the `libcap-ng` library. This function was intended to prevent regaining capabilities in setuid-root programs but failed to do so effectively.
*   The `seunshare` utility, part of `policycoreutils`, incorrectly used the `capng_lock` function, thus inheriting the vulnerability.
*   `seunshare` is setuid root, making the vulnerability exploitable by local unprivileged users.
*   The core issue is a discrepancy in how the setuid syscall interacts with the saved set-user-ID when dropping privileges.  Setuid was setting the saved uid, while `seunshare` and related software were creating a condition where it didn't.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Capability Handling:** The `capng_lock` function failed to properly prevent privilege escalation by setuid programs after they drop privileges.
*   **Incorrect setuid assumptions:** SUID programs were incorrectly relying on the setuid syscall to ensure that saved set-user-IDs were set as well as effective IDs.
*   **Setuid Misuse:** The `seunshare` utility, as a setuid root program, was a vulnerable vector to exploit the faulty `capng_lock` mechanism.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges (root) on the affected system. By using `seunshare`, an attacker can bypass the intended restriction on setuid behavior.  Specifically, the attacker can make setuid programs 'forget' their saved uid after calling `setuid(getuid())`.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is launched from the local system.
*   **Setuid Program Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `seunshare` utility to execute a program that attempts to drop and regain privileges using setuid. The attacker needs a program with such characteristics to trigger the flaw.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Execution of setuid Binary:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a setuid-root program, like `/sbin/seunshare` and a custom program that drops and regains root privileges.  The program to regain root must use setuid, not setresuid or seteuid to regain root privs.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The provided Openwall message by Andy Lutomirski includes a proof-of-concept C program (`sesploit.c`) demonstrating the vulnerability. The `sesploit` program, when executed normally, drops privileges and cannot regain them. However, when executed through `seunshare`, the program can regain root privileges, showing a bypass of the intended security measures.
*   The discussion on oss-security highlights the issue with using setuid and how this interaction with `capng_lock` was creating a vulnerability with how the saved set-user-ID was handled
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry for CVE-2014-3215 also states that `seunshare` in `policycoreutils` was executing programs in a way that changes the relationship between the `setuid` syscall and the `getresuid` saved set-user-ID value.
*   The fix for this issue requires a kernel change (to set `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag and have SELinux exec transition support) to address the ability to regain privileges, as well as a patch to `libcap-ng` to address the inadequate protection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on the oss-security mailing list.
*   Several Linux distributions were affected, including Red Hat, OpenSuSE, and Mageia.
*   Patches and updates were released to address this issue, involving both kernel and user-space fixes.  The primary fix was the new kernel functionality to set the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` bit to prevent programs regaining privileges they had dropped.
