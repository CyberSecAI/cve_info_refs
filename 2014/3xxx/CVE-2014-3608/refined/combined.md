Serra Armani, Renato commented: "Some news is: if I ban galera in 2 controllers and let it up and running in just one of the Controllers this error stops and instances are launched 20 times faster than when I have more than one node.  I performed more than 10 tests launching 10 instances on the same time and I didn't receive the error.  So looks like the DeadLock error is directly caused by Galera sync delays  I'm still thinking if is not better to change the Galera cluster to Active/passive? Instead still trying to make it work in active/active. Do you think it can fix that bug?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1141972#c5)  Jeff Dexter    2014-09-20 10:47:02 UTC  ``` Mysql Log, when deadlocking  140919 17:47:36 [Note] WSREP: BF kill (1, seqno: 19588074), victim: (1962) trx: 54282168 140919 17:47:36 [Note] WSREP: Aborting query: commit 140919 17:47:36 [Note] WSREP: victim 54282168 in state 7 140919 17:47:36 [Note] WSREP: COMMIT failed, MDL released: 1962 140919 17:47:36 [Note] WSREP: cert failure, thd: 1962 is_AC: 0, retry: 0 -

# [OSSA 2014-032] Nova VMware driver still leaks rescued images (CVE-2014-3608)

---

*From*: Tristan Cacqueray <tristan.cacqueray () enovance com>

*Date*: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 11:08:43 -0400

```
OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-032
CVE: CVE-2014-3608
Date: October 2, 2014
Title: Nova VMware driver still leaks rescued images
Reporter: Garth Mollett (Red Hat)
Products: Nova
Versions: up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported an incomplete fix to OSSA-2014-017
(CVE-2014-2573), a vulnerability affecting Nova. If an authenticated
user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command
it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean
up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can
use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the
Nova VMware driver are affected by this flaw.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/94281/>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/109624/>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno release 2014.2.0 and in
the upcoming 2014.1.3 release.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide

operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Important: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1782)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
(CVE-2014-3608)

The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
Security.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149737)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, unhandled database deadlock conditions triggered with some

database configuration edge cases. "Deadlock found when trying to get lock;
try restarting transaction" messages may have been logged, and database
transactions may have been lost. With this update, actions are retried on
deadlock conditions, resulting in robust database communication.
(BZ#1141972)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMware driver are affected by this flaw.

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1781)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
(CVE-2014-3608)

The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
Security.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149749)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

### Bug Description

Garth Mollet of Red Hat reported the following when examining the fix for OSSA 2014-017:

.. there may still be a regression in the upstream patches.

With the new patch applied it appears unrescue can still fail if the live vm is in the suspended state. With the new patch unrescue will attempt to poweroff the vm, however poweroff will fail if state == suspended:

# Only PoweredOn VMs can be powered off.

        # Raise Exception if VM is suspended

        elif pwr\_state == "suspended":

             reason = \_("instance is suspended and cannot be powered off.")

             raise exception.InstancePowerOffFailure(reason=reason)

And this exception will be uncaught in the case of a manual unrescue, leading to the same end scenario in Jaroslavs test above, where destroying the vm in error state will leave the -rescue instance.

Red Hat bugzilla reference - <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1108406>

Can we confirm if this is a regression / incomplete fix of [bug #1269418](/bugs/1269418) ?

The bug in the RH bugzilla is set to private so most folks here will be unable to read it. However my comments in the post above refering to "Jaroslavs test above" is refering to testing by Jaroslav Henner that noted that a manual

unrescue would fail if the VM was powered on (due to RH missing the additional patch to power off a powered on

vm when doing unrescue).

There does appear to still be a gap in the previous fix. That fix assumed that cleanup only needed to happen if vm\_state == RESCUED. But a rescued instance can be suspended in which case that check would fail and not try to unrescue the instance or clean up the rescued image.

It does appear that if the unrescue were attempted and then failed for any reason, perhaps due to the power state check above, Nova should still clean up the rescue instance.

As this came from Red Hat I can assign a CVE directly in this bug report without the need for the request to secalert@redhat if/when it's confirmed as needed.

Draft impact description -

Title: Nova VMWare driver leaks rescued images - incomplete fix

Reporter: Garth Mollett (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Versions: from 2013.2 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:

Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported an incomplete fix to CVE-2014-2573, a vulnerability affecting Nova. If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMWare driver are affected by this flaw.

Obviously it's entirely up to VMT how advisories for incomplete fixes are handled.

But if it helps you at all in deciding what the process should be, MITRE and Red Hat (as a CNA for opensource), as a standard practice, do assign a new CVE to an issue when a fix is found to be incomplete after the original fix/advisory is released.

We (Red Hat product security) will also release a new erratum / security advisory if such a case occurs and we have already released one for the original issue.

That is our process though, by no means am I saying it should be yours as well. Just trying to be helpful :)

The two options are open. ERRATAs are usually when the information provided in an advisory is incorrect, and should therefore be redacted. New advisories are for when a subsequent issue is found.

Incomplete fixes fall in the middle. In this specific case, it feels like the original OSSA is still correct, but a regression / corner case was discovered in the fix. I think it's simpler to just issue a new one in that specific case (referencing the old one).

"incomplete fix to CVE-2014-2573" -> "incomplete fix to OSSA-2014-017 (CVE-2014-2573)"

Otherwise looks good.

Updated impact description including ttx recommended changes -

Title: Nova VMware driver still leaks rescued images

Reporter: Garth Mollett (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Versions: from 2013.2 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported an incomplete fix to OSSA-2014-017 (CVE-2014-2573), a vulnerability affecting Nova. If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMware driver are affected by this flaw.

Couple of things. Firstly, I wrote a discussion patch to change the way the vmware driver does rescue images here:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/106078/>

The basic idea is that it doesn't create a second VM, so it can't leak. However, it's dependent on a bunch of outstanding work, and needs more testing. It also needs to handle upgrades. I think it's the ultimate solution to this problem, though.

I reviewed Andrew's patch above. I think it's robust and it would be correct (although I haven't actually run it, yet). However, I'm concerned about the performance impact. It adds a call to get\_vm\_ref\_from\_name on every destroy(). This is an ugly call, and called here on a rescue image, it would almost always result in an additional call to vim\_utils.get\_objects(). This is an unfortunate function which traverses every object on the vsphere server to find what it's looking for.

I'll have a look at this in a bit more detail tomorrow. Hopefully I can come up with a slightly cheaper fix until we can do this properly.

I have previously reproduced this error, however it is no longer reproducible on master. It is not possible to suspend a rescued instance, or to rescue a suspended instance.

I will try to reproduce again on Icehouse.

The reason this is no longer reproducible on master is commit 8ff170dc95bf3101fe38a2624e941bfa3b7c1138, which restricts the state transitions of a rescued instance. Given that the fix for this in the VMware driver in icehouse would be custom for the stable branch, I favour backporting the non-deadend patch.

It's already proposed for backport here: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109624/>

We don't care about Havana anymore, so ignore me. Patch got stuck in Zuul, just rechecked it. This should be ready soon.

### Bug Description

Garth Mollet of Red Hat reported the following when examining the fix for OSSA 2014-017:

.. there may still be a regression in the upstream patches.

With the new patch applied it appears unrescue can still fail if the live vm is in the suspended state. With the new patch unrescue will attempt to poweroff the vm, however poweroff will fail if state == suspended:

# Only PoweredOn VMs can be powered off.

        # Raise Exception if VM is suspended

        elif pwr\_state == "suspended":

             reason = \_("instance is suspended and cannot be powered off.")

             raise exception.InstancePowerOffFailure(reason=reason)

And this exception will be uncaught in the case of a manual unrescue, leading to the same end scenario in Jaroslavs test above, where destroying the vm in error state will leave the -rescue instance.

Red Hat bugzilla reference - <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1108406>

Can we confirm if this is a regression / incomplete fix of [bug #1269418](/bugs/1269418) ?

The bug in the RH bugzilla is set to private so most folks here will be unable to read it. However my comments in the post above refering to "Jaroslavs test above" is refering to testing by Jaroslav Henner that noted that a manual

unrescue would fail if the VM was powered on (due to RH missing the additional patch to power off a powered on

vm when doing unrescue).

There does appear to still be a gap in the previous fix. That fix assumed that cleanup only needed to happen if vm\_state == RESCUED. But a rescued instance can be suspended in which case that check would fail and not try to unrescue the instance or clean up the rescued image.

It does appear that if the unrescue were attempted and then failed for any reason, perhaps due to the power state check above, Nova should still clean up the rescue instance.

Title: Nova VMWare driver leaks rescued images - incomplete fix

Reporter: Garth Mollett (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Versions: from 2013.2 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:

Garth Mollett from Red Hat reported an incomplete fix to CVE-2014-2573, a vulnerability affecting Nova. If an authenticated user places an instance into rescue, and then issues a suspend command it will cause the instance to enter an ERROR state. Nova does not clean up an instance in this state correctly upon deletion. An attacker can use this to launch a denial of service attack. Only setups using the Nova VMWare driver are affected by this flaw.

Obviously it's entirely up to VMT how advisories for incomplete fixes are handled.

But if it helps you at all in deciding what the process should be, MITRE and Red Hat (as a CNA for opensource), as a standard practice, do assign a new CVE to an issue when a fix is found to be incomplete after the original fix/advisory is released.

We (Red Hat product security) will also release a new erratum / security advisory if such a case occurs and we have already released one for the original issue.

That is our process though, by no means am I saying it should be yours as well. Just trying to be helpful :)

The two options are open. ERRATAs are usually when the information provided in an advisory is incorrect, and should therefore be redacted. New advisories are for when a subsequent issue is found.

Incomplete fixes fall in the middle. In this specific case, it feels like the original OSSA is still correct, but a regression / corner case was discovered in the fix. I think it's simpler to just issue a new one in that specific case (referencing the old one).

"incomplete fix to CVE-2014-2573" -> "incomplete fix to OSSA-2014-017 (CVE-2014-2573)"

Otherwise looks good.

Couple of things. Firstly, I wrote a discussion patch to change the way the vmware driver does rescue images here:

<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/106078/>

The basic idea is that it doesn't create a second VM, so it can't leak. However, it's dependent on a bunch of outstanding work, and needs more testing. It also needs to handle upgrades. I think it's the ultimate solution to this problem, though.

I reviewed Andrew's patch above. I think it's robust and it would be correct (although I haven't actually run it, yet). However, I'm concerned about the performance impact. It adds a call to get\_vm\_ref\_from\_name on every destroy(). This is an ugly call, and called here on a rescue image, it would almost always result in an additional call to vim\_utils.get\_objects(). This is an unfortunate function which traverses every object on the vsphere server to find what it's looking for.

I'll have a look at this in a bit more detail tomorrow. Hopefully I can come up with a slightly cheaper fix until we can do this properly.

The basic idea is that it doesn't create a second VM, so it can't leak. However, it's dependent on a bunch of outstanding work, and needs more testing. It also needs to handle upgrades. I think it's the ultimate solution to this problem, though.
I reviewed Andrew's patch above. I think it's robust and it would be correct (although I haven't actually run it, yet). However, I'm concerned about the performance impact. It adds a call to get\_vm\_ref\_from\_name on every destroy(). This is an ugly call, and called here on a rescue image, it would almost always result in an additional call to vim\_utils.get\_objects(). This is an unfortunate function which traverses every object on the vsphere server to find what it's looking for.
I'll have a look at this in a bit more detail tomorrow. Hopefully I can come up with a slightly cheaper fix until we can do this properly.

I have previously reproduced this error, however it is no longer reproducible on master. It is not possible to suspend a rescued instance, or to rescue a suspended instance.

I will try to reproduce again on Icehouse.

Can we please get confirmation that this is actually still an issue?

Sorry, forgot to update here. It is definitely reproducible on Icehouse. Patch in progress.

The reason this is no longer reproducible on master is commit 8ff170dc95bf3101fe38a2624e941bfa3b7c1138, which restricts the state transitions of a rescued instance. Given that the fix for this in the VMware driver in icehouse would be custom for the stable branch, I favour backporting the non-deadend patch.

It's already proposed for backport here: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109624/>

We don't care about Havana anymore, so ignore me. Patch got stuck in Zuul, just rechecked it. This should be ready soon.
