```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper restriction of access to various components in the luci site extension-related URLs.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Insufficient access control, allowing unauthorized access to administrative functions.
- Impact of exploitation: Privilege escalation, allowing non-administrative users to add new users, add systems, remove clusters from conga, and view logs.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a special URL to access restricted components in `/luci/homebase` and `/luci/cluster` menus.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be an authenticated user, although they do not need to be an administrative user.
