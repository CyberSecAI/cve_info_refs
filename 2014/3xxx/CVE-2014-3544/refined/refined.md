Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the Skype ID field within user profiles in Moodle. Specifically, the application failed to properly filter potentially harmful code entered into this field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper filtering allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Skype ID field. This code is then stored persistently in the Moodle database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** When a user views a profile containing the malicious Skype ID, the injected JavaScript will execute within the user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens through the execution of malicious JavaScript. This may allow the attacker to impersonate another user.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The injected script could redirect the user to a malicious website or execute other actions within their session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Profile Editing:** An attacker can inject the malicious code by editing their own user profile and inputting the payload into the Skype ID field.
- **Viewing Affected Profiles:** Any user who views the profile of an attacker who has injected malicious code will become a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Moodle User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the Moodle platform to modify their profile.
- **Basic Knowledge of XSS:** An understanding of how to craft JavaScript payloads that will execute within a browser is needed.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Field:** The 'Skype ID' field in Moodle user profiles was susceptible to XSS.
- **Payload Example:** The provided example payload `x" onload="prompt('XSS by Osanda')">` demonstrates a simple injection that would trigger a JavaScript prompt in the victim's browser.
- **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 2.7, 2.6 to 2.6.3, 2.5 to 2.5.6, 2.4 to 2.4.10 and earlier unsupported versions were affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** Moodle versions 2.7.1, 2.6.4, 2.5.7 and 2.4.11 contained the fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Osanda Malith Jayathissa.
- Moodle assigned the issue the identifier MDL-45683.
- The fix involved escaping the Skype ID value to prevent the execution of injected code, as evidenced by the code change in `user/profile.php`.
- The Moodle security advisory is  MSA-14-0024.
