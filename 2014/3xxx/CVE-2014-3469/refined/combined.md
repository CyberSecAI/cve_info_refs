| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102022#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 11:07:10 UTC  ``` Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library, causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

* CVE-2014-3466

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-05-30 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

See more information about CVE-2014-3466 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3466)

## Synopsis

Moderate: libtasn1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0687)

## Topic

Updated libtasn1 packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
and decoding functions.

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:57:56 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=13456#c0)  David Walser    2014-05-30 17:08:38 CEST  ``` Security issues fixed upstream in libtasn1 have been made public today (May 30): <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/30/2>  Updated packages uploaded for Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated libtasn1 packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library, causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3467).  It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input. This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value with NUL byte (CVE-2014-3468).  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3469).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0815)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues is
now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3466)

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting CVE-2014-3466,
CVE-2014-3468, CVE-2014-3467, and CVE-2014-3469. Upstream acknowledges
Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

This updated package provides an updated kernel component that includes
fixes for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security
fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2013-6378, CVE-2014-0203, CVE-2014-1737, CVE-2014-1738, CVE-2014-1874,
CVE-2014-2039 and CVE-2014-3153 (kernel issues)

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Topic

Updated gnutls packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). The gnutls packages also
include the libtasn1 library, which provides Abstract Syntax Notation One
(ASN.1) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules
(DER) encoding and decoding functions.

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3466)

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original
reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the GnuTLS or libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## GNU Libtasn1 3.6 released

```
Hello,
 I have just released libtasn1 3.6. This release fixes possible
invalid memory accesses by the DER decoder found using the Codenomicon
TLS test suite. The changes since the last release follow.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.6 (released 2014-05-25) [stable]
- Corrected an off-by-one error in ASN.1 DER tag decoding.
- Several improvements and new safety checks on DER decoding;
  issues found using Codenomicon TLS test suite.
- Marked asn1_der_decoding_element() as deprecated. Use
  asn1_der_decoding() instead.

GNU Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER/BER encoding/decoding.  GNU Libtasn1 is used by
GnuTLS to handle X.509 structures and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
V5 structures.

Package        : libtasn1-3
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3468 CVE-2014-3469

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libtasn1-3, a library that
manages ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. An attacker
could use those to cause a denial-of-service via out-of-bounds access
or NULL pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# GnuTLS Security update for Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3.

* **Document ID:***7015302*
* **Creation Date:**01-Jul-2014
* **Modified Date:**01-Jul-2014
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Open Enterprise Server
  + **SUSE Products:**SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

## Environment

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 4 (SLES 10 SP4)
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 (OES 2) Linux Support Pack 3

## Situation

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 General support has ended on 31 July 2013.
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3 General support has ended on  31 July 2013.

A number of GnuTLS related Security Vulnerabilities were reported.

Due to the current extended support status for Novell Open
Enterprise Server 2 SP3, the Novell and SUSE teams have closely
collaborated to make these fix available for Novell OES2 SP3 customers.

## Resolution

The oes2sp3-gnutls-8896 patch containing the mentioned fixes for SLES 10 SP4 is released through the public OES2 SP3 patch repositories on 30 June 2014.

GnuTLS has been patched to ensure proper parsing of session ids during the
TLS/SSL handshake. Additionally three issues inherited from libtasn1 have been
fixed.

Further information is available at
[http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3](http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3 "http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3")

These security issues have been fixed:

* Possible memory corruption during connect (CVE-2014-3466)
* Multiple boundary check issues could allow DoS (CVE-2014-3467)
* asn1\_get\_bit\_der() can return negative bit length (CVE-2014-3468)
* Possible DoS by NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2014-3469)

Security Issues:

* [CVE-2014-3466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466 "CVE-2014-3466")
* [CVE-2014-3467](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3467 "CVE-2014-3467")
* [CVE-2014-3468](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3468 "CVE-2014-3468")
* [CVE-2014-3469](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3469 "CVE-2014-3469")
## Cause

 Multiple GnuTLS related security vulnerabilities.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:57:56 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.  Upstream commits: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/lib/element.c?id=a8b3e14f84174e01755bfd1be5448fffce7c9ffa> <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/lib/element.c?id=3d6a02f19ff15a38dae9686033e37499b3968256> <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/lib/element.c?id=53958290ab731c8486531a3bdef54a933533579d>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-29 11:41:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:18:06 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in libtasn1 3.6: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2014-05/msg00006.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:27:42 UTC  ```  Created libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103087](show_bug.cgi?id=1103087 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:27:44 UTC  ```  Created mingw-libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103088](show_bug.cgi?id=1103088 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw-libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:27:47 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1103089](show_bug.cgi?id=1103089 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw32-gnutls: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:09:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0596 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0596.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:10:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0594 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0594.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-06-04 07:52:10 UTC  ``` libtasn1-3.6-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Advisories](index.html) » MGASA-2014-0247

## Updated libtasn1 packages fix CVE-2014-3467-9

Publication date: 02 Jun 2014

Modification date: 02 Jun 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-3467](CVE-2014-3467.html)
,
[CVE-2014-3468](CVE-2014-3468.html)
,
[CVE-2014-3469](CVE-2014-3469.html)

## Description

```
Updated libtasn1 packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library,
causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted
ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash
(CVE-2014-3467).

It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could
incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input.
This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using
libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value
with NUL byte (CVE-2014-3468).

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's
asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application
called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine
the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input,
libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing
an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3469).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Disclaimers

OUR WEBSITE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR WEBSITE IS WITH YOU. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY) WITH RESPECT TO OUR WEBSITE, WHICH INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

WE DO NOT PROMISE THAT THE WEBSITE IS FREE OF PROBLEMS OR ERRORS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, We make no warranty that Our Website will meet Your requirements or that Our Website will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free or that defects in Our Website will be corrected. We make no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of Our Website or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through Our Website. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by You through Our Website or from Us or Our officers, directors, employees, or agents (collectively, "Micro Focus Parties") shall create any warranty.

In no event will We be liable, in connection with Our Website, for (i) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive or similar damages; loss of profits, business, data (including, but not limited to, personal data) or programs (including, but not limited to, the cost of recovery or replacement of such data or programs); loss, damage or any costs due to interruption, delay or inability to use any of Our products or services, even if informed of the possibility of such damages in advance or (ii) any amount greater than One Hundred Dollars ($100).

We may provide products (such as hardware or software), services (such as software subscription services, consulting, hardware maintenance or repair or software maintenance, installation, or training) or access via Our Website under the terms of a separate agreement between You and Us, such as a license agreement or separate terms of sale (each, an "Other Agreement"). Our obligations regarding any product, service, or access that We make available to You under any Other Agreement shall be governed solely by the Other Agreement under which such product, service or access is provided and these Website Terms of Use shall not be deemed or construed to alter the terms of any such Other Agreement. If there is an inconsistency between these Website Terms of Use and any Other Agreement, the Other Agreement will control. You are not granted any rights to download, install, or use any software that is supplied with or includes an end user license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such end user license agreement, whether presented to you before or after download. In the event software is provided without an end user license agreement, you may use the software solely for your personal, informational and non-commercial purposes.

You agree that all such notices, disclosures, and other communications that We provide to You electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

#### Entire Agreement

The Micro Focus Parties are third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Website Terms of Use that reference them.

#### Governing Law and Venue

These Website Terms of Use and disputes arising hereunder will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. You and We irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consent to venue in the State of Delaware and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Delaware and (ii) waive any claims of forum non conveniens with respect to such venue. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Website Terms of Use.

#### Dispute Resolution

The procedures set forth in this Article will apply to any dispute, controversy or claim, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or relating hereto ("Dispute") and will be the sole and exclusive procedures in connection with any such Dispute. You and We irrevocably waive any right to commence any action in or before any governmental authority, except as expressly provided in these Website Terms of Use, and except to the extent provided under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, YOU AND WE IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY TRIAL IN A COURT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY DISPUTE.

Except as provided below, all Disputes shall be resolved through mandatory and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, State of California before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude Us from seeking equitable remedies as set forth below. The prevailing party in any legal proceeding shall recover its expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable attorney's fees. Except as required by applicable Law, the existence, content and result of all Dispute resolution proceedings will be confidential and will not be disclosed (other than to the extent required to enforce any agreement or award). You and We will each request that the arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement.

You acknowledge that, in the event You breach (or attempt or threaten to breach) Your obligations regarding Our intellectual property, We may be irreparably harmed and may proceed immediately to seek equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction should find that You have breached (or attempted or threatened to breach) any such obligations, You agree that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, You will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling Your performance and restraining You from any further breaches (or attempted or threatened breaches).

#### Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer

Our Websites contain forward-looking statements that are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties associated with, among other items, the changing economic and business conditions in the countries, sectors and business segments in which We operate. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, e.g., numerous assumptions regarding Our present and future business strategies and the environments in which We operate. They are not guarantees and may prove inaccurate. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Please do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by any applicable laws or regulations.

#### Miscellaneous

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Website Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Website Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, You nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Website Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Website Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Website Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of Your use of Our Website. These Website Terms of Use will be interpreted without application of any strict construction in favor of or against You or Us. These Website Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be assigned by Us without restriction.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:57:56 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

## Topic

Updated libtasn1 packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
and decoding functions.

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:31:12 UTC  ``` It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input.  This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value with NUL byte.  The following upstream commit corrects the issue and causes the function to report error rather than return negative length value: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/?id=1c3ccb3e040bf13e342ee60bc23b21b97b11923f>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-29 11:41:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:18:04 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in libtasn1 3.6: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2014-05/msg00006.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:28 UTC  ```  Created libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103087](show_bug.cgi?id=1103087 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:31 UTC  ```  Created mingw-libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103088](show_bug.cgi?id=1103088 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw-libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:34 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1103089](show_bug.cgi?id=1103089 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw32-gnutls: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:09:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0596 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0596.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:10:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0594 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0594.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-06-04 07:52:08 UTC  ``` libtasn1-3.6-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
