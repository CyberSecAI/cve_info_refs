  "CVE-2014-3100": {
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the Android KeyStore service. The encode_key routine, called by encode_key_for_uid, can overflow the filename buffer due to missing bounds checking. This is due to the KeyStore service being designed with simplicity in mind, resulting in buffers not always being larger than needed, which was a deliberate design choice.  A malicious application can exploit this to achieve code execution under the KeyStore process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of bounds checking in the `encode_key` routine when encoding a key name, allowing a buffer overflow when the encoded key name exceeds the allocated buffer size.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Missing bounds check"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote code execution under the `keystore` process, leading to the potential leakage of sensitive information and arbitrary cryptographic operations on behalf of the user.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious application can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted long string as the `keyName` argument through the Binder interface. The overflow occurs on the stack within the keystore process.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the Android device. The attacker can then make a call to a binder interface within the keystore service."

          "Data Execution Prevention (DEP)",
          "Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)",
          "Stack Canaries",
          "Encoding of certain characters"
        ],
        "mitigations": "The fix involves proper length calculation for encoded key names using `getKeyNameForUidWithDir` and avoiding C-style strings within the getKeyForName function.",
