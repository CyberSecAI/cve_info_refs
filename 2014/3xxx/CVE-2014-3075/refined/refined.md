Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient control over MIME types during file uploads in the document list coach view of IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition. The system does not properly validate or restrict file uploads based on their MIME types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of MIME Type Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper validation of MIME types during file uploads. This allows users to upload files with potentially dangerous MIME types.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The inadequate validation allows for the upload of arbitrary files, including those with malicious content like HTML containing embedded JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could upload a malicious file (e.g., HTML with embedded JavaScript). When a user accesses this file through the browser, the embedded JavaScript could be executed, leading to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session, potentially giving access to sensitive information or control of the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the document list coach view. An attacker with the ability to upload files can exploit this.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can perform the attack remotely through the network, by uploading a file from a remote system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the vulnerable document list coach view of the IBM BPM or WebSphere Lombardi Edition. This could mean being a user of the application with the required privileges to add or update documents.

**Additional details:**
*   The fix introduces server-side configuration options, allowing administrators to define a whitelist of allowed MIME types for uploads and a blacklist for MIME type mappings during downloads.
*   The default configuration, without explicit configuration, acts as a blacklist for `text/html`, mapping it to `text/plain`. This mitigates the impact of the vulnerability out of the box, but the administrator must manually configure this if they change the configurations in the 100Custom.xml file.
*   The vulnerability affects IBM Business Process Manager Standard, Express, and Advanced versions 7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x as well as WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.x.
