# Security Bulletin: Insufficient control over MIME types in Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition document feature (CVE-2014-3075)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

You cannot restrict file uploads by MIME type in a document list coach view. As a result, potentially malicious files, such as HTML that contains embedded JavaScript can be uploaded and run in the browser.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-3075](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-3075)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM Business Process Manager Standard V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x
* IBM Business Process Manager Express V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x
* IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x
* IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.0.x

## Remediation/Fixes

Install IBM Business Process Manager interim fix JR50092 as appropriate for your current IBM Business Process Manager or WebSphere Lombardi Edition version.

* [IBM Business Process Manager Express](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Standard](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Advanced](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092)
* [IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR50092)

If you are using earlier unsupported versions, IBM strongly recommends that you upgrade to a supported version.

The fix introduces additional functionality to the product with two server-side configuration options. One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads.

* A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads.
* A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.

The following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file:

<server>

  <!-- mime type allowlist which specifies mime types accepted for -->

  <!-- upload to document list or document attachment -->

  <document-attachment-accepted-mime-types>

    <!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload -->

    <allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type>

    <!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload -->

    <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>

    <mime-type>img/png</mime-type>

  </document-attachment-accepted-mime-types>

  <!-- mime type blocklist which specifies mappings from unacceptable -->

  <!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from -->

  <!-- document list or document attachment -->

  <document-attachment-download-mime-types>

    <!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type -->

    <mime-type-map>

      <from>text/html</from>

      <to>text/plain</to>

    </mime-type-map>

    <!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content/octet-stream -->

    <mime-type-map>

      <from>application/pdf</from>

      </mime-type-map>

  </document-attachment-download-mime-types>

</server>

**Note**: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blocklist for the text/html MIME type and maps it to the text/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the blocklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file.

## Error description

* ```
  You cannot restrict file uploads by mime-type in a document list
  coach view. As a result, HTML that contains embedded JavaScript
  can be uploaded and run in the browser.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  The IBM BPM document management feature might allow a remote
  attacker to include arbitrary files. A remote attacker might
  upload a malicious file from a remote system, which might allow
  the attacker to run  arbitrary code on the vulnerable web
  server.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM 7.2.0.5, 7.5.1.2, 8.0.1.2
  and 8.5.0.1 that introduces additional functionality to the
  product with two server-side configuration options (one for file
  uploads and one for file downloads):

  A server-side configuration option is introduced which allows an
  optional white-list of mime-types to be specified. Mime-types
  included in the list will be allowed for upload while all other
  mime types will be blocked from upload.

  A server-side configuration option is introduced which allows an
  optional black-list of mime-type mappings to be specified. Each
  mime-type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a
  specific mime-type to a specific mime-type upon download.

  The following example is a sample configuration of new options,
  which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file:

  <server>
    <!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted
  for -->
    <!-- upload to document list or document attachment -->
    <document-attachment-accepted-mime-types>
      <!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload
  -->
      <allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type>
      <!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload -->
      <mime-type>text/plain</mime-type>
      <mime-type>img/png</mime-type>
    </document-attachment-accepted-mime-types>

    <!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from
  unacceptable -->
    <!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from -->
    <!-- document list or document attachment -->
    <document-attachment-download-mime-types>
      <!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type
  -->
      <mime-type-map>
        <from>text/html</from>
        <to>text/plain</to>
      </mime-type-map>
      <!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to
  content/octet-stream -->
      <mime-type-map>
        <from>application/pdf</from>
        </mime-type-map>
    </document-attachment-download-mime-types>
  </server>

  Note: The default configuration (without configuration
  information provided in 100Custom.xml) acts as a blacklist for
  the text/html mime-type and maps it to the text/plain mime-type.
  Providing a configuration in 100Custom.xml overrides the default
  configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the
  blacklist, it should be explicitly added in 100Custom.xml.

  To retrieve this fix, on Fix Central
  (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral) search for JR50092:

      1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition
  from the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
      2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR50092, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
