- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing length check in the code that handles DNS parameters within the `rtsold(8)` daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. Specifically, a malformed router advertisement message, particularly within the DNSSL option, can lead to this overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can cause the `rtsold(8)` daemon to crash. Although theoretically, it might be possible to inject code, the presence of stack protection mechanisms makes this exceptionally difficult. The crash does not disrupt existing DNS configurations, and the kernel continues to process router advertisements.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious or malformed router advertisement messages sent to a vulnerable host.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target and be able to send IPv6 Router Advertisement messages.
