CVE-2014-3947:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The powermail extension allowed uploading files with crafted extensions, which could be executed as PHP files on the server when using Apache with mod_mime. The vulnerability stemmed from failing to check uploaded filenames against the fileDenyPattern.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary Code Execution, Insecure File Upload
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious file disguised as a regular file type.
  - Attack vectors: Uploading malicious files using the file upload functionality in the powermail extension.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the powermail extension.
