Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3900:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting vulnerability within the Piwigo application. The specific location and mechanism are not detailed in this document, but the vulnerability exists in the handling of user input during photo editing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically during photo editing, before rendering it in the web browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users. This can lead to various attacks such as:
   - Session hijacking
   - Phishing
   - Defacement
   - Malware distribution

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker exploits this vulnerability remotely through the web application.
- Input manipulation: The attacker injects malicious code within the photo editing functionality of Piwigo.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to interact with the photo editing functionality of Piwigo.
- No authentication is required according to the CVSS score, but it may need a user with privileges to edit photos.
- The attacker must be able to craft and inject malicious code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Piwigo 2.6.3 and earlier versions.
- The fix for this XSS vulnerability was included in the same changeset (28678) that addressed a SQL injection vulnerability (mentioned but not detailed).
- The vulnerability was reported by Yuji Tounai of bogus.jp.
- The CVSS score (2.6, Low severity) indicates a network-based attack with high complexity. This might suggest the XSS is not trivially exploitable and may require a specific set of conditions or user interaction to trigger.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
