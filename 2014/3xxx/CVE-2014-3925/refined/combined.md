| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-29 11:01:06 UTC  ``` It was reported that sosreport collected and stored "/etc/fstab" in the resulting archive of debugging information. This may contain plain text passwords (or a link to the file containing them), for example, credentials for Samba mounts. This could leak passwords to an attacker who is able to access the archive. Sensitive information in "/etc/fstab" should be sanitized before being stored by sosreport.  Note that "/etc/fstab" is world-readable, so local attackers should not be a concern (they can read the file anyway). This could be an issue when the sosreport is sent to other parties.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dolev Farhi of F5 Networks for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-29 11:15:27 UTC  ```  Created sos tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1102640](show_bug.cgi?id=1102640 "CLOSED ERRATA - sos: /etc/fstab collected by sosreport, possibly containing passwords [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-29 11:16:57 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/29/6>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-29 16:39:25 UTC  ``` I don't think it's ever been advised to store password in /etc/fstab, so if you trust local users enough to view that file, then whatever sosreport stores in /tmp is probably just as "safe".  sosreport is run manually by an administrator, and the resultant archive is stored in /tmp (/var/tmp in Fedora), but the administrator actually has to send this archive to someone.  sosreport also has this warning before it even runs (except on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5):  "The generated archive may contain data considered sensitive and its content should be reviewed by the originating organization before being passed to any third party."  Because sosreport makes no claims to not collecting private data (and explicitly indicates that it might), and the point of it is to collect pertinent system data (excluding some obvious things like kerberos keys or files with known sensitive information that does not aid in diagnostic process), I don't know if this can actually be considered a flaw.  After all, random sysadmin might decide to put anything in any file that sosreport collects that we could never "teach" sosreport to ignore or scrub (you could try to do pattern-based matching on contents of files but you'll never catch everything).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c4)  Bryn M. Reeves    2014-05-30 10:55:57 UTC  ``` I agree - these types of problems (although we consider them bugs) really don't seem to meet the requirements for a 'vulnerability' in the CVE sense of the term.  An 'attacker' can only benefit from the information if an authorized user makes it available to them (the claim that files are left world-readable in /tmp in one of the recent bugs is false).  They are a privacy concern for users who do not adequately review the data collected from their own systems and ignore the disclaimer text and we maintain the password scrubbing features as a convenience to minimize the manual review effort required.  We've never tried to imply that the scrubbing is perfect and went through several rounds of legal review last year to tighten up the wording presented in the UI to make this clear.  > After all, random sysadmin might decide to put anything in any file that > sosreport collects  Right; and this does happen, particularly in the context of support cases (the primary use of sos). A typo in a shell redirection or cp command can spray unexpected content around in ways that are impossible to predict or automatically detect.  > except on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Due to be fixed in 5.11 via [bug 1065468](show_bug.cgi?id=1065468) - it was the first el5 release available after we'd completed reviews.  I'd much rather we kept CVEs and the full security process for problems like [bug 1099151](show_bug.cgi?id=1099151 "CLOSED ERRATA - insecure temp files usage in gfs2 plugin") (insecure temp files in el5's sos) where a local user can actually cause real harm.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1102633#c5)  Bryn M. Reeves    2014-05-30 13:44:03 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream:  commit 7b46d34654735d925bcb2a3e4b27b65dce994519 Author: Bryn M.

Message-ID: <53871407.8070306@redhat.com>

From: Murray McAllister <mmcallis@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request: sos: /etc/fstab collected by sosreport, possibly containing
 passwords

Good morning,

 From <<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1102633>>:

It was reported that sosreport collected and stored "/etc/fstab" in the
resulting archive of debugging information. This may contain plain text
passwords (or a link to the file containing them), for example,
credentials for Samba mounts. This could leak passwords to an attacker
who is able to access the archive. Sensitive information in "/etc/fstab"
should be sanitized before being stored by sosreport.

Note that "/etc/fstab" is world-readable, so local attackers should not
be a concern (they can read the file anyway). This could be an issue
when the sosreport is sent to other parties.

Acknowledgements:

Red Hat would like to thank Dolev Farhi of F5 Networks for reporting
this issue.

I think it should have a CVE, but I am less sure due to "/etc/fstab"
being world-readable, so I have not assigned one.

Thanks,

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [sosreport](/security/cves?package=sosreport) - Set of tools to gather troubleshooting data from a system

## Details

Dolev Farhi discovered an information disclosure issue in SoS. If the

/etc/fstab file contained passwords, the passwords were included in the

SoS report. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3925](/security/CVE-2014-3925))

Mateusz Guzik discovered that SoS incorrectly handled temporary files. A

local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files

or gain access to temporary file contents containing sensitive system

information. ([CVE-2015-7529](/security/CVE-2015-7529))

Use CVE-2014-3925 for this vulnerability in (only) Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5. The points we considered from our perspective (not
necessarily in order of importance) are:

 - deciding whether an issue is within, or outside, the scope of CVE
   can depend on practices of other vendors, not the change process
   that is used by a specific vendor

   Related to this, Red Hat could decide to not recognize the CVD ID
   within its change process, A few years ago, Red Hat had been doing
   this through the NVD Vendor Comments mechanism, for example: see
   "Official Statement from Red Hat" under
   <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1130> and
   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=577578>

 - from the perspective of an arbitrary end user, the
   <https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/3592> document doesn't
   really seem to imply that the sosreport data would commonly need to
   be reviewed, because there is no discussion of potentially
   sensitive information

 - the "No space left on device" discussion seems to imply that
   there's a big file in some cases, and people might reasonably
   decline to review a big file unless told to do so

 - on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), nobody is telling them to do
   so

 - although it's completely true that "An 'attacker' can only benefit
   from the information if an authorized user makes it available to
   them," making it available is the common and intended purpose of
   using the sosreport feature

 - it's reasonable for an organization to have an internal security
   policy that no password may be sent to the Technical Support
   branch of any vendor

 - in a typical large enterprise, there may be dozens of software
   products that have "prepare/send debugging information to Technical
   Support" features, and often (because of the nature of other
   software products), there is no possibility of sending a password

 - thus, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), the potential presence
   of a password, coupled with the lack of warning, seems to sometimes
   violate reasonable expectations, and some end users would probably
   make use of a CVE ID to track this
