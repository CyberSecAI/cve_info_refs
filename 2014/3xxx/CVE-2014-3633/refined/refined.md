Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2014-3633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune()` function within the libvirt library. This function incorrectly computes an index for a disk in a virtual machine's "live" (non-persistent) configuration and then uses that index to access a disk in the "persistent" configuration. Because these two disk configurations may not always match, this can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning that the software accesses a memory location outside of the allowed range of a data structure (disk array). This occurs due to the use of an incorrect index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Crash of libvirtd:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability, causing the `libvirtd` process to crash, which can lead to a denial of service.
-   **Potential memory leak:**  There is a possibility of an attacker being able to leak memory from the `libvirtd` process.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote attacker:** A remote attacker who has a read-only connection to `libvirtd` can exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Read-only connection:** The attacker doesn't need write permissions, only a read-only connection to the libvirtd service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have network access to the machine running `libvirtd`.
-   The attacker must be able to establish a read-only connection to the libvirtd service.
-   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges other than the ability to connect to the service via the read-only socket.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

-   The vulnerability is present in libvirt versions from v0.9.8 up to v1.2.8.
-   The vulnerability was discovered by Luyao Huang of Red Hat.
-   Patches were backported to older versions of libvirt to address this issue.
-   The fix involves using the correct disk definition when looking up the disk for blkiotune.
-   The issue is present when a disk is attached to a VM "live" (not written into the persistent configuration) and statistics are then requested from the persistent configuration.
-   Red Hat has issued a moderate security rating for this vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability has also been fixed in Fedora, openSUSE, Debian and Ubuntu.
