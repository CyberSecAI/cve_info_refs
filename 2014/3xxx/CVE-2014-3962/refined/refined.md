Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `videocat.php` and `single.php` scripts, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the `url` parameter of both `videocat.php` and `single.php` files.
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    - AND/OR time-based blind SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Complete Compromise:** In severe cases, successful SQL injection can lead to complete compromise of the web server. This is indirectly implied by the "Remote Code Execution" mentioned in the exploit title.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`videocat.php` and `single.php`).
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `url` parameter within these scripts is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** An understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques is required for successful exploitation.
- **Tools:** Automated tools like SQLmap can aid the exploitation.
