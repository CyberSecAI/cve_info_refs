### Bug Description

Hi all,

There is no quota for allowed address pair, user can create unlimited allowed address pair, in the backend, there will be at least 1 iptables rule for one allowed address pair. I tested if we use the attachment script to add about 10,000 allowed address pair. It will cost 30 sec to reflesh iptables rules in kernel... I think that bad man can use this api to attack compute nodes. This will make the compute nodes crash or very slow only if we add enough allowed address pair rules...

Thanks.

Liping Mao

This sounds similar to nova [bug 1184041](/bugs/1184041) (OSSA 2013-020, CVE-2013-4185). In which OpenStack release(s) did you observe this behavior?

Hi Jeremy Stanley ,

I think this is not the same problem with [bug 1184041](/bugs/1184041).

This problem happens only if neutron with allowed address pair extension.

So it can happen in Havana / Icehouse / Juno trunk.

The reproduce steps :

1. boot a vm.

2. update the vm port with the attachment script.

Then you can see about 10,000 iptables rules on compute node. and the update of iptable rule will be very slow. And I think the performance of iptables update rule will be very bad if there are too many rules.

And the root cause is that we do not have quota for allowed address pair. And a user can update unlimited allowed address pair for one port.

Regards,

Liping Mao

Hi,

I write a patch to add quota for allowed address pair, this can avoid the user to set up unlimited rules.

Thanks.

Right, I didn't mean to imply that this is the same bug as described in 1184041, merely that the vulnerability is similar enough for us to reuse some of the same impact analysis wording when publishing a security advisory.

There is clearly a possibility of causing a denial of services using this kind of 'attack'.

In theory on would make allowed address pairs a resource with a quota, but that's not easy as they're an attribute rather than a resource.

So I would rather take the approach in the suggested patch of putting a configurable hard limit on the number of address pairs allowed on a port.

It should also possible to have both a maximum number of pairs per port and a global per-tenant maximum number of additional address pairs.

Hi Salvatore,

Thanks for your confirm and comments.

One question about the "global per-tenant maximum number of additional address pairs".

In my opinion, if we have the maximum number of the pairs per port , and we also already have the quota for ports. Then the max number of the tenant is Pair\_Max\_Per\_Port \* Port\_Num. Seems like we do not need the maximum number for the tenant.

What I do in the patch is similar to "extra route" extension.

<https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/db/extraroute_db.py#L100-103>

It also did not limit the maximum number of route per tenant.

What do you think about this? Thanks .

Liping Mao

@Tristan Cacqueray

Thanks for your comments. And I use "git format-patch" to re-create the patch file, and this time it has commit log. Please feel free to tell me, if there is anything need to be modified.

BTW,

Do you mean that I need to commit these three patchs on 2014-07-17, 1500UTC ?

Sure , I am available to do that at that time. Although this is mid-night in my local time : -)

Regards，

Liping Mao

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1120)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address
pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address
pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number
of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute
node unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.

The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version, most notable of which are:

* Multiple Open vSwitch agent fixes: the agent now sets bridges in the

correct order to avoid breaking tunnel networks, creates the integration
bridge if it is missing, sets the secure-failing mode for integration
bridges to ensure the 'openvswitch' service does not program NORMAL action
on restart and instead relies on L2 agent to manage those bridges on
restart, limits veth names to 15 characters, and no longer spawns RPC
consumers before all the needed data structures are ready to be accessed.

* RPC interactions between the DHCP agent and the Neutron plug-in have

been optimized.

* Rule updates for security groups are now applied more effectively.
* Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): a possible race condition when deleting a

firewall has been fixed; iptables updates are no longer deferred for the
service.

* Metering: metering data for egress and ingress are now reported

separately; incorrect router key used to report against MongoDB has
been fixed.

* Load-Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS): resources are now registered against

quotas engine; rootwrap filters are now shipped independent of L3 agent
filters.

* Metaplugin now supports multiple RPC workers.
* The following plug-ins have been updated: BigSwitch, Brocade, Cisco N1k,

HyperV, OFAgent, PLUMgrid, and VMWare NSX.

Refer to <https://launchpad.net/neutron/icehouse/2014.1.2> for more
information on the changes included in the 2014.1.2 of openstack-neutron.
(BZ#1127439)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, OpenStack Networking could stop processing network ports that

disappeared from the integration bridge during the L2-agent loop, even
after those ports were back on the bridge. As a result, updates for
temporarily disappeared ports were not handled by the L2 agent. With this
update, these ports are no longer marked as processed if not found on the
integration bridge. Ports are now processed correctly even after they
temporarily disappear from the integration bridge. (BZ#1115588)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

I'm trying to reproduce locally.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826#c4)  Nir Yechiel    2014-07-28 12:19:58 UTC  ``` I guess this is a dup of 1122724?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826#c5)  Jakub Libosvar    2014-07-28 12:23:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Nir Yechiel from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826#c4)) > I guess this is a dup of 1122724?  I don't think so. [Bug 1122724](show_bug.cgi?id=1122724 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [Doc] user_group definition in lbaas_agent.ini") deals with RHEL 7 and new deployment while this ([bug 1123826](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826 "CLOSED ERRATA - [Upgrade] After Upgrade from Havana to Icehouse LBaas doesn't work - \"cannot find group id for 'nogroup' \"")) is on RHEL 6.5 and it used to work in RHOS 4 but after upgrade to RHOS 5 it doesn't work with the same config file.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826#c8)  Toni Freger    2014-08-26 12:24:42 UTC  ``` LBaaS works properly after upgrade (All at once) From: <http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/4.0/2014-08-15.1/> To: <http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/rel-eng/OpenStack/5.0-RHEL-6/2014-08-22.1/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1123826#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-02 17:59:56 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1119)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address
pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address
pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number
of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute
node unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.

The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version, most notable of which are:

* Multiple Open vSwitch agent fixes: the agent now sets bridges in the

correct order to avoid breaking tunnel networks, creates the integration
bridge if it is missing, sets the secure-failing mode for integration
bridges to ensure the 'openvswitch' service does not program NORMAL action
on restart and instead relies on L2 agent to manage those bridges on
restart, limits veth names to 15 characters, and no longer spawns RPC
consumers before all the needed data structures are ready to be accessed.

* RPC interactions between the DHCP agent and the Neutron plug-in have

been optimized.

* Rule updates for security groups are now applied more effectively.
* Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): a possible race condition when deleting a

firewall has been fixed; iptables updates are no longer deferred for the
service.

* Metering: metering data for egress and ingress are now reported

separately; incorrect router key used to report against MongoDB has
been fixed.

* Load-Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS): resources are now registered against

quotas engine; rootwrap filters are now shipped independent of L3 agent
filters.

* Metaplugin now supports multiple RPC workers.
* The following plug-ins have been updated: BigSwitch, Brocade, Cisco N1k,

HyperV, OFAgent, PLUMgrid, and VMWare NSX.

Refer to <https://launchpad.net/neutron/icehouse/2014.1.2> for more
information on the changes included in the 2014.1.2 of openstack-neutron.
(BZ#1127439)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, OpenStack Networking could stop processing network ports that

disappeared from the integration bridge during the L2-agent loop, even
after those ports were back on the bridge. As a result, updates for
temporarily disappeared ports were not handled by the L2 agent. With this
update, these ports are no longer marked as processed if not found on the
integration bridge. Ports are now processed correctly even after they
temporarily disappear from the integration bridge. (BZ#1115588)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

### Bug Description

Hi all,

There is no quota for allowed address pair, user can create unlimited allowed address pair, in the backend, there will be at least 1 iptables rule for one allowed address pair. I tested if we use the attachment script to add about 10,000 allowed address pair. It will cost 30 sec to reflesh iptables rules in kernel... I think that bad man can use this api to attack compute nodes. This will make the compute nodes crash or very slow only if we add enough allowed address pair rules...

Thanks.

Liping Mao

Hi Jeremy Stanley ,

I think this is not the same problem with [bug 1184041](/bugs/1184041).

This problem happens only if neutron with allowed address pair extension.

So it can happen in Havana / Icehouse / Juno trunk.

The reproduce steps :

1. boot a vm.

2. update the vm port with the attachment script.

Then you can see about 10,000 iptables rules on compute node. and the update of iptable rule will be very slow. And I think the performance of iptables update rule will be very bad if there are too many rules.

And the root cause is that we do not have quota for allowed address pair. And a user can update unlimited allowed address pair for one port.

Regards,

Liping Mao

Hi,

I write a patch to add quota for allowed address pair, this can avoid the user to set up unlimited rules.

Right, I didn't mean to imply that this is the same bug as described in 1184041, merely that the vulnerability is similar enough for us to reuse some of the same impact analysis wording when publishing a security advisory.

There is clearly a possibility of causing a denial of services using this kind of 'attack'.

In theory on would make allowed address pairs a resource with a quota, but that's not easy as they're an attribute rather than a resource.

So I would rather take the approach in the suggested patch of putting a configurable hard limit on the number of address pairs allowed on a port.

It should also possible to have both a maximum number of pairs per port and a global per-tenant maximum number of additional address pairs.

Hi Salvatore,

Thanks for your confirm and comments.

One question about the "global per-tenant maximum number of additional address pairs".

In my opinion, if we have the maximum number of the pairs per port , and we also already have the quota for ports. Then the max number of the tenant is Pair\_Max\_Per\_Port \* Port\_Num. Seems like we do not need the maximum number for the tenant.

What I do in the patch is similar to "extra route" extension.

<https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/db/extraroute_db.py#L100-103>

It also did not limit the maximum number of route per tenant.

What do you think about this? Thanks .

Liping Mao

@Liping Mao Would you be available at that time to submit patchs to gerrit ? Else, can you please reformat your patch and add a commit message using "git am" in order for us to push them while keeping authorship.

@Tristan Cacqueray

Thanks for your comments. And I use "git format-patch" to re-create the patch file, and this time it has commit log. Please feel free to tell me, if there is anything need to be modified.

BTW,

Do you mean that I need to commit these three patchs on 2014-07-17, 1500UTC ?

Sure , I am available to do that at that time. Although this is mid-night in my local time : -)

We can add Rally test in Kuryr-libnetwork CI job to understand the performance impact of Kuryr. The following Rally Test case should be added: list network create network(with kuryr and without kuryr) delete n... | |
