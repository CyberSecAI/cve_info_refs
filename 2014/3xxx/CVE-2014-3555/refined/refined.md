{
  "CVE-2014-3555": {
    "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute node unusable.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of a quota for allowed address pairs in OpenStack Neutron.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "No enforced limit on allowed address pairs, leading to resource exhaustion.",
      "Creation of a large number of firewall rules which overwhelm the system.",
       "Lack of resource management/control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS) by overwhelming neutron firewall rules and rendering compute nodes unusable, impacting performance, and potential node crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Authenticated user abuses API to create a large number of allowed address pairs.",
         "API abuse"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Sufficiently authorized user with access to the OpenStack Neutron API."
    ],
    "Affected versions": [
      "OpenStack Neutron before 2013.2.4",
      "2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1"
    ],
    "Additional details": "Each allowed address pair translates into at least one iptables rule, and excessive rules cause performance issues in iptables management and result in a slow or crashed node"
  }
