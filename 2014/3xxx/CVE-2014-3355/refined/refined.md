Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of transit Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) packets by the metadata flow feature in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the metadata of these RSVP flows is processed and stored in the control plane database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect processing of malformed RSVP packets by the metadata infrastructure. When a device with the metadata flow feature enabled receives these malformed RSVP packets, it leads to a device reload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can cause the vulnerable device to reload, potentially repeatedly, causing an extended DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An unauthenticated attacker can send malformed RSVP packets to a vulnerable device. These malformed packets are transit traffic, meaning they are not destined for the vulnerable device but are passing through it.
- The vulnerabilities are triggered by malformed RSVP packets on IP protocols 46 and 134.
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited over IPv6 starting from Cisco IOS Software Release 15.3(1)T.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets (specifically RSVP packets) to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of the affected infrastructure to send the packets to a vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**

- Devices are only vulnerable if the "metadata flow" feature is configured. This can be checked using the command `show running | include metadata`.
- The vulnerability is also present when the "metadata flow" command is configured on an interface.
- No workarounds are available.
- The Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
- This vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCug75942 and is one of two vulnerabilities addressed in the advisory, the other being CVE-2014-3356 (tracked by CSCue22753).
