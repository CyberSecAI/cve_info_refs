Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the file path within the `DumpToFile` method of the `NQMcsVarSet` ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The `DumpToFile` method fails to sanitize the provided filename path, allowing for directory traversal. This means an attacker can specify a path that goes outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting files in arbitrary locations on the system.
- **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides in an ActiveX control, which is a technology that runs within Internet Explorer. This means the vulnerability is tied to the use of this specific ActiveX control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can leverage the directory traversal vulnerability to write files under the context of the current process.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By writing specifically crafted files to specific locations, attackers can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, which allows them to run malicious commands on the system within the privileges of the current user.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow a complete compromise of the vulnerable system.
- **System Crash:** If the attack involves overwriting critical system files, it can also lead to the system crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can embed the malicious ActiveX control in a webpage which, when visited by a user, will allow the exploit to occur.
- **Malicious Email Messages:** Attackers can send emails containing the malicious ActiveX control, allowing the exploit to be triggered by opening the email.
- **User Interaction Required:**  Exploitation requires user interaction, where the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (e.g. an HTML email).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, by having the user interact with a malicious website or email.
- **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files containing the malicious payload.
- **Exploit Knowledge:** Attackers need specific knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control and how it handles file paths.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the target user to interact with their malicious content (visit a webpage or open an email).

**Additional Details:**
- **Vendor Response:** The vulnerability was disclosed publicly due to a lack of timely response from the vendor (Novell) initially.
- **Mitigation:** The killbit can be set on the ActiveX control to disable scripting within Internet Explorer.
- **Patch:** The vendor eventually issued an update in Sentinel Agent Manager 7.2 to disable the vulnerable method and prevent exploitation.
