Thanks,

MyBB Team

    Re: “Note about updated package for 1.8.4”

    Anyone who gets these updates via RSS won’t see this edited version of the announcement, since it was added after the RSS feed was polled/sent. I’d suggest writing a new blog post/announcement when there’s something to add or the information has changed.

      Writing a new blog post for a minor bug fix would be a bit exaggerated.

        Given to the fact it was neither security related nor affecting a major feature there is actually no indication writing another announcement. There also haven’t been support threads about the issue.

    I don’t know whats wrong with my installation. I tried to use the update package and the complete package (override existing files). Both Upgrades lead me to an update “Upgrade my existing copy of MyBB to 1.8.3”

    After the upgrade I’m still on 1.8.3

and XSS work on i.a.:

• http://localhost/mybb/admin/index.php?module=user-groups

• http://localhost/mybb/admin/index.php?module=user-users&action=edit&uid=1

• http://localhost/mybb/admin/index.php?module=user-users&action=add

• http://localhost/mybb/modcp.php?action=finduser

(in "description" is also XSS, but work on fewer pages)

[CVE-2015-2149](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2149) — **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mod CP and Admin CP in MyBB 1.6.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.**

and XSS work on i.a.:

• http://localhost/mybb/admin/index.php?module=user-users&action=edit&uid=1

• http://localhost/mybb/modcp.php?action=editprofile&uid=1

**Timeline**:

2013-12-15 — reported on mybb.com e-mail, no answer

2013-12-28 — [reported on mybb.com](community_mybb_com-thread_149380-post_1054359.png) ([responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure))

2014-04-26 — "silent" fix "*POST admin/index.php?module=config-profile\_fields&action=edit*" XSS ("*POST admin/index.php?module=user-groups&action=edit&gid=4*" still work!) in security release MyBB 1.6.13 — lack of information in the changelog etc about XSS vulnerability in Mod CP and Admin CP

2015-01-16 — XSS still work (reported in MyBB 1.6.12 — 13 months earlier) in the latest version MyBB 1.8.3, disclosed on twitter

2015-02-15 — fixed in [MyBB 1.8.4](https://blog.mybb.com/2015/02/15/mybb-1-8-4-released-feature-update-security-maintenance-release/)
