Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-3684](CVE-2014-3684.html)

## Description

```
Updated torque packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Chad Vizino reported that within a TORQUE Resource Manager job a non-root
user could use a vulnerability in the tm_adopt() library call to kill
processes
he/she doesn't own including root-owned ones on any node in a job
(CVE-2014-3684).

This update implements the upstream fixes.

Subject: tm_adopt() vulnerability in TORQUE Resource Manager

Within a TORQUE Resource Manager job, the tm_adopt() TORQUE library call
enables a user-built executable calling tm_adopt() to adopt any session id
(and its child processes) regardless of the session id owner on any node
within a job. When a job that includes the executable calling tm_adopt()
exits, the adopted processes are killed along with the job processes during
normal job cleanup. This can enable a non-root user to kill processes
he/she doesn't own including root-owned ones on any node in a job.

The issue has been fixed in the following commit numbers for the listed
TORQUE Resource Manager versions:

4.2-dev
967cdc80150690459a47a35a658abeee0ca6e5cb

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Chad - thank you for posting this!

All - Chad had brought this issue to the distros list yesterday (not
realizing that public issues like it should go to oss-security right
away, which we've explained), and it was assigned CVE-2014-3684.

Package        : torque
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3684
Debian Bug     : 763922

Chad Vizino reported a vulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch
processing queueing system. A non-root user could exploit the flaw in
the tm_adopt() library call to kill any process, including root-owned
ones on any node in a job.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.
