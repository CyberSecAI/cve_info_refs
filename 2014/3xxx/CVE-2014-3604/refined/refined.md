    "summary": "The provided documents contain information about CVE-2014-3604. This vulnerability exists in the Not Yet Commons SSL project due to a flaw in the hostname verification implementation. The vulnerability can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker by crafting a malicious X.509 certificate.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL project to verify that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field of X.509 certificates.",
      "weaknesses": "The primary weakness is the flawed hostname verification implementation in the Not Yet Commons SSL project. This allows for bypassing the intended security checks during SSL/TLS handshake.",
      "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability enables a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to spoof a valid SSL server, potentially intercepting sensitive data, manipulating communications, or performing other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a man-in-the-middle attacker intercepting communication and presenting a specially crafted, malicious X.509 certificate that bypasses the flawed hostname verification mechanism.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and manipulate network traffic. They require the capability to craft or possess a malicious X.509 certificate that bypasses the hostname verification."
    },
      "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2015:1888) which contains information about the fix for CVE-2014-3604 in Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1. It also includes a Bugzilla entry (bug 1131803) which tracks the vulnerability, it's fix and affected products. The GitHub entry includes a YAML file documenting the CVE. The severity was rated as 'Important' by Red Hat. CVSS v2 score is 5.8."
