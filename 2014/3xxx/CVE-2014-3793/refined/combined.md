How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#####

##### 1. Summary

VMware Workstation, Player, Fusion, and ESXi patches address a vulnerability in VMware Tools which could result in a privilege escalation on Microsoft Windows 8.1.

##### 2. Relevant Releases

VMware Workstation 10.x prior to version 10.0.2

VMware Player 6.x prior to version 6.0.2

VMware Fusion 6.x prior to version 6.0.3

ESXi 5.5 without patch ESXi550-201403102-SG
ESXi 5.1 without patch ESXi510-201404102-SG
ESXi 5.0 without patch ESXi500-201405102-SG

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Guest privilege escalation in VMware Tools
A kernel NULL dereference vulnerability was found in VMware Tools running on Microsoft Windows 8.1. Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to an escalation of privilege in the guest operating system.
VMware would like to thank Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team for reporting this issue to us.
The vulnerability does not allow for privilege escalation from the Guest Operating System to the host. This means that host memory can not be manipulated from the Guest Operating System.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2014-3793 to this issue.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
