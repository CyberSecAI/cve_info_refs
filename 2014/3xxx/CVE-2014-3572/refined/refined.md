Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3572:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ssl3_get_key_exchange` function within the `s3_clnt.c` file of OpenSSL. The code improperly handles the scenario where a server omits the `ServerKeyExchange` message during an ephemeral ECDH cipher suite handshake.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **ECDHE-to-ECDH Downgrade Attack:** The primary weakness is that a malicious SSL server can force a client to downgrade from an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) to a less secure Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) handshake by omitting the `ServerKeyExchange` message.

- **Loss of Forward Secrecy:** By downgrading the handshake, the server can cause a loss of forward secrecy, potentially compromising past communication if the server's private key is later exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker can potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack by downgrading the encryption, which allows them to intercept or modify data in transit.
- **Loss of forward secrecy:** Past sessions secured using vulnerable OpenSSL libraries are susceptible to decryption if the server's private key is compromised later.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a malicious or compromised SSL/TLS server that intentionally omits the `ServerKeyExchange` message during a handshake with a vulnerable OpenSSL client, forcing a less secure ECDH exchange.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to control or have access to the SSL server involved in the communication with a vulnerable client.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the server's response and omit the ServerKeyExchange message.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed in January 2015, prompting immediate patching efforts from various vendors and projects.
- Patches involve changes to the OpenSSL code to correctly handle cases where the `ServerKeyExchange` message is omitted during handshakes using ephemeral ECDH cipher suites and to explicitly not allow the omission.
- Some advisories mentioned the issue was also addressed in combination with other issues (ex: Logjam - CVE-2015-4000)
