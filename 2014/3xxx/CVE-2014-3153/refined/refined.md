{
  "CVE-2014-3153": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `futex_requeue` function in the Linux kernel does not validate if the source and destination futex addresses are different when performing a Priority Inheritance (PI) requeue operation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A missing check in the `futex_requeue` function allows a local, unprivileged user to specify the same address for both the source and destination futex in a PI requeue operation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability to achieve local privilege escalation, obtain sensitive information or trigger a denial-of-service (system crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local unprivileged user can exploit the futex syscall by calling FUTEX_REQUEUE operation to perform unsafe waiter modification.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system. No special privileges are required prior to the escalation."
  }
