As far as I see, escaping file names was added to diffutils in 2012. The
feature is not present in a squeeze environment. [CVE-2014-0471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0471) does not
apply.

Directory traversal during unpack is possible now. I will wait one day
before releasing an exploit package.

Oh, woah, right now I'm either guessing I mixed up my chroots when
initially checking the submitted test package, or had the files in /tmp
from a previous extraction, otherwise I cannot explain this blunder. :/
I've reproduced this now locally on a squeeze chroot with a test package.

In any case, squeeze could be affected by a partial upgrade of patch, so
the options I see are:

  1. Simply revert the patch, and ignore issues w/ partial upgrades (at
     least for now?).
  2. Revert the patch and add versioned depdendencies against the working
     patch package. This might require some dist-upgrade tests, though.
  3. Fix the patch to take into account the old behaviour, by checking
     if either of the filenames (escaped and unescaped) are unsafe.

I guess the last one is the “safest option”. In any case I'd like
input from the security team (CCed just to make sure you get this),
and I'm very sorry guys about this. :(

I think I could have either option 1 or 3 ready for later today,
option 2 would require more consideration and testing.

Thanks,
Guillem

That is true.

Since patch is the one doing the job, how about performing a --dry-run
first and checking the output?

This goes both ways:
* if using dependencies, they would need to be added to all versions
so that e.g. wheezy's dpkg can't be used with squeeze's patch
* if handling both behaviors, it should also apply to both releases.

Unless I missed something, of course.

Something nobody has mentioned yet: isn't the critical path between
wheezy and jessie/sid rather than between squeeze and wheezy?  Support
for double-quoted filenames was added in patch 2.7, which entered
unstable only in June 2013.

Cheers,
       Sven

For a quick fix, 3 is probably the best.

But I think this bug shows that validating diffs is not viable in the
long run. We need to either fix patch(1) not to traverse directory
symlinks, or implement a completely different strategy:

1) Unpack .orig.tar.
2) Delete all symlinks (and maybe also other non-regular files).
3) Apply patches.
4) Restore all the files deleted in step 2.

In another mail Javier suggested to check --dry-run output. I don't
think this is feasible. Parsing --dry-run output is probably even harder
than parsing patches, and after reading
<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?37642> I wouldn't trust it to be
very "dry" anyway...

Did you mean 1? After having checked to implement 3, there's many
parts of the code that need to be changed and moved around, I'll try
to cook an actual patch to see how bad it is though.

There's also the newly supported git formatted patches now recognized
by patch, “fortunately” Dpkg::Source::Patch does not understand them
and because it creates any necessary directories (or what looks like
one), I don't see a way it can be exploited. But I might be short on
imagination at this moment.

Also another issue is that independently of partial upgrades, dpkg-dev
might be used on other systems where we don't know what patch version
is available, so it could be vulnerable or not depending on that. :/

Yeah, I've to agree with that, the only really safe option here is for
patch to not follow any symlinks at all. And that seems to have been
partly the intention behind the new default and the option to revert
it with --follow-symlinks, but it seems to only apply to the last
component.

A patch program that follows symlinks also means that extracting a
Debian source package manually is unsafe…

Yeah, I don't think parsing --dry-run output is a good idea either,
it's not future-proof and prone to break if the output changes.

Your proposed solution might be the safer and more future-proof way
to deal with the current patch changing behaviour, but it might not
cover all future new features (think similar extensions like the git
formatted patches).

Thanks,
Guillem

I had assumed that the patch for 3 would we straightforward. If this is
not the case, then I'd go for 1 for now, and maybe we'll figure out
something better later. Of course, Security Team's option may vary.

Oh, I completely forgot about git patches. I have a hunch that there's a
clever way to exploit them. :\

Well it looks a bit gross, because it might end up generating strange
directories, as those are recorded by the same code analyzing and
deciding if a pathname is safe or not. So if we have to check both
we don't know which one will end up being used by patch and would
need to create them all. :/

And actually, after having pondered about this for a bit, it just
occurred to me that the most strightforward and safe solution of all is
to simply and completely ban C-style strings, which would be option 4.
Because we avoid any discrepancy in behaviour from dpkg-dev and patch,
avoid any strange directory creation side-effects, and works everywhere,
even on systems with old/new or non-GNU patch programs. Also any such
new patches would not extract correctly on old suites anyway. And why
should we support those encoded characters at all, when we've lived
w/o them all this time.

Attached a non-tested quick patch implementing this. I'll start
testing it and preparing packages for all suites.

That's what I fear too, but I've been trying to concoct some PoC and
failed.

Thanks,

    Dpkg::Source::Patch: Outright reject C-style filenames in patches

    Because patch only started recognizing C-style filenames in diffs
    in version 2.7, it's not safe to assume one behaviour or the other,
    as the system might or might not have a recent enough version, or
    a GNU patch program at all. There's also no reason we should be
    supporting this kind of strange encoded filenames in patches, when
    we have not done so up to now.

    Let's just ban these types of diffs and be done with it.

    Fixes: [CVE-2014-0471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0471)

Ok thanks, I'm preparing the uploads for squeeze and wheezy right
away. The wheezy one contains some translation updates, hope that's
fine.

Thanks,

    Dpkg::Source::Patch: Outright reject C-style filenames in patches

    Cherry picked from commit d49704f7fd699e809aead799a1dd4d20d969665a.

    Because patch only started recognizing C-style filenames in diffs
    in version 2.7, it's not safe to assume one behaviour or the other,
    as the system might or might not have a recent enough version, or
    a GNU patch program at all. There's also no reason we should be
    supporting this kind of strange encoded filenames in patches, when
    we have not done so up to now.

    Let's just ban these types of diffs and be done with it.

Subject: CVE request: directory traversal in DSA-2915-1-patched dpkg in Debian squeeze

Hi,

The recent update[1] of dpkg for CVE-2014-0471 in Debian squeeze (and
possibly Ubuntu lucid[2]) actually introduces a vulnerability in that
release[3], while it was not affected by the original vulnerability.
The newly introduced vulnerability is dependent on the version of
patch(1) that is installed on the system, so that:

updated dpkg in squeeze + patch(1) from squeeze = vulnerable
updated dpkg in squeeze + patch(1) from wheezy = not vulnerable
updated dpkg in wheezy + patch(1) from squeeze = vulnerable (but not confirmed)
updated dpkg in wheezy + patch(1) from wheezy = not vulnerable

In other words, if the updated dpkg package is not installed in a
squeeze system, this new vulnerability would only be exposed if a
system is partially upgraded to wheezy.

Given that at least one PoC demonstrates that squeeze's updated
package is vulnerable, while the previous dpkg in wheezy isn't (it
refuses to unpack the package), I think this is a new vulnerability
and should therefore receive its own CVE.

If you agree, could you please assign one?

Thanks in advance.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> Another path traversal was discovered

The short answer is that bug 746498 is CVE-2014-3864, and bug 749183
is CVE-2014-3865. We can also, first, review the status of the CVEs
related to our 1 May 2014 message. The proposed CVE mappings for all
four of these CVEs are indicated below; these would potentially start
to be processed for the cve.mitre.org web site as early as today.

CVE-2014-3127 (revised CVE description to be published at
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3127> soon):

dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the "C-style
encoded filenames" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch
program lacks this feature, which triggers an interaction error that
allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and
modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source
package. NOTE: this can be considered a release engineering problem in
the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471.

CVE-2014-3227 (new CVE to be published at
<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3227> and
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3227> soon):

dpkg 1.15.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect
the patch program to be compliant with a need for the "C-style encoded
filenames" feature, but is supported in environments with noncompliant
patch programs, which triggers an interaction error that allows remote
attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files
outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic
constraints on the behavior of an external program.

CVE-2014-3864 (new CVE to be published at
<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3864> and
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3864> soon):

(reference is
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746498>)

Directory traversal vulnerability in dpkg-source 1.3.0 allows remote
attackers to modify files outside of the intended directories via a
crafted source package that lacks a --- header line.

CVE-2014-3865 (new CVE to be published at
<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3865> and
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3865> soon):

(reference is
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749183>)

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in dpkg-source 1.3.0
allow remote attackers to modify files outside of the intended
directories via a source package with a crafted Index: pseudo-header
in conjunction with (1) missing --- and +++ header lines or (2) a +++
header line with a blank pathname.
