Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3862:

**Verification:**
The content directly references CVE-2014-3862 and provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `observationMedia/value/reference/@value` within the CDA.xsl stylesheet. This allows an attacker to embed a URL that will cause the browser to request it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsanitized input: The stylesheet does not sanitize or validate the `reference/@value` attribute within the `observationMedia` element.
- Insecure direct object reference.
- Leaking potentially sensitive data via HTTP Referer headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the browser to send an HTTP `Referer` header to an external server, which includes the URL of the current page.
- If the URL contains private session state or other sensitive data, this data can be leaked to the attacker's server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious C-CDA document with a specially crafted `observationMedia` element.
- This C-CDA document is then loaded into an EHR system using the vulnerable `CDA.xsl` stylesheet for rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a C-CDA document.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit the malicious document to an EHR system that uses the vulnerable CDA.xsl stylesheet.
