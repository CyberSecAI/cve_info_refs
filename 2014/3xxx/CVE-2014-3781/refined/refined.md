Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper password verification within the `dcXmlRpc::setUser()` method in Dotclear. Specifically, the method does not validate the provided password before passing it to the `dcAuth::checkUser()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by sending an XML-RPC request with a valid username and an empty password.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the password parameter before using it in the authentication check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Dotclear application.
*   **Potential Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once authenticated, an attacker could potentially access sensitive data, modify content, or take other actions depending on the privileges of the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML-RPC Interface:** The attack vector is through the XML-RPC interface of Dotclear.
*   **Network-based:** Attackers can send crafted XML-RPC requests to exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Dotclear instance.
*   **XML-RPC Access:** The XML-RPC interface must be enabled on the target system (note that it's disabled by default).
*   **Valid Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username for the Dotclear installation.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `inc/core/class.dc.xmlrpc.php` file, specifically in the `setUser()` method:

```php
private function setUser($user_id,$pwd)
{
    if ($this->core->auth->userID() == $user_id) {
        return true;
    }

    if ($this->core->auth->checkUser($user_id,$pwd) !== true) {
        throw new Exception('Login error');
    }

    return true;
}
```

The code first checks if the provided user ID matches the currently authenticated user ID. If it doesn't, it proceeds to check user credentials via `dcAuth::checkUser()`. However, the vulnerability occurs because the method does not validate that `$pwd` is not empty or null before passing it to `dcAuth::checkUser()`. This allows an attacker to send a request with an empty password, which bypasses the `checkUser` method effectively bypassing authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in Dotclear version 2.6.3.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Egidio Romano from karmainsecurity.com
