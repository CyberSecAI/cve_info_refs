Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3147

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Splunk Web handles CSV file uploads. Specifically, when an authenticated user uploads a CSV file containing an XSS payload, this payload is not properly sanitized or encoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data (the uploaded CSV file), specifically when it contains JavaScript code or other XSS attack vectors.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored within the application and executed in the context of other users when they interact with the affected functionality. In this case, it's the search box autocomplete feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the search box auto-complete function.
*  **Account Compromise**: An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can be used to modify data within the application or potentially exfiltrate data to an external server controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSV File Upload:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted CSV file containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Search Box Auto-complete:** The stored XSS is triggered when another user interacts with the search box, specifically the auto-complete functionality, causing the malicious payload from the uploaded CSV to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user on the Splunk instance to be able to upload a CSV file.
*   **Upload Access**: The attacker needs access to upload CSV files within the application.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   Splunk Enterprise versions 6.0.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2, and 6.0.3. (All versions after 6.0 and before 6.0.4)
