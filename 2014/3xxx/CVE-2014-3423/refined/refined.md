Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `browse-url-mosaic` function within the `lisp/net/browse-url.el` file of GNU Emacs. This function writes to a file named `/tmp/Mosaic.$PID`, where `$PID` is the process ID of the Emacs instance. The issue is that the function blindly overwrites this file without checking if it's a symbolic link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable temporary file name:** The file name `/tmp/Mosaic.$PID` is predictable and based on the PID.
*   **Unvalidated file overwrite:** The function directly overwrites the file at `/tmp/Mosaic.$PID` without any checks.
*   **Symbolic link vulnerability:** The function does not check if the target file is a symbolic link before writing to it, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link at `/tmp/Mosaic.$PID` that points to a different file or directory that the attacker wants to modify. When the vulnerable `browse-url-mosaic` function is called within Emacs, it will write to the target of the symlink, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and symbolic links on the local filesystem.
*   **Emacs execution:** The attacker needs to induce a user to execute the vulnerable `browse-url-mosaic` function within Emacs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local user access to the system running Emacs.
*   The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link with the predictable name `/tmp/Mosaic.$PID` before Emacs attempts to write to it.
*   The attacker does not require root access or special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory and the discussion in the mailing lists indicate that the maintainers initially considered this vulnerability to be less of a problem since it was caused by the function's attempt to interact with Mosaic, an old browser. However, it was decided to fix it.
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2008-4994, which also involved symlink attacks via temporary files.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Emacs version 24.3.91.
