The provided content contains information about CVE-2014-3997.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `MetadataServlet` of ManageEngine Password Manager Pro and IT360.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL injection vulnerability exists due to improper input sanitization in the `MetadataServlet`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `sv`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration, including sensitive passwords stored in Password Manager Pro.
    - Remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux due to the database being compromised.
    - Control of all the computers and smartphones managed by a Desktop Central/IT360 instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via a GET request to the `/MetadataServlet.dat` endpoint (for PMP) or `/console/MetadataServlet.dat` (for IT360) with a malicious SQL payload in the `sv` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For Password Manager Pro, the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
- For IT360, a valid user account is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- ManageEngine Password Manager Pro (PMP) [MSP]: all versions from v5 to version 7 build 7003
- ManageEngine IT360 [MSP]: all versions from v8 to v10.1.1 build 10110
This affects all versions of the products released since 03-Apr-2008.
