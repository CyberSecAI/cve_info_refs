Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in the `/cgi-bin/help/doIt.cgi` script of VM Turbo Operations Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `xml_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`. This can lead to information disclosure and potential compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable CGI script.
- The `xml_path` parameter is used to specify the path of a file, and by using directory traversal sequences like `../../`, an attacker can access files outside of the webroot

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No special authentication appears to be required.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path of the vulnerable CGI script (`/cgi-bin/help/doIt.cgi`) and the vulnerable parameter (`xml_path`)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable versions are 4.5.x and earlier of VM Turbo Operations Manager.
- The exploit example provided demonstrates accessing `/etc/passwd`.
- A fix was released in version 4.6 of VM Turbo Operations Manager.
