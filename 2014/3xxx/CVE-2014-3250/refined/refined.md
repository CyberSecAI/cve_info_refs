Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3250:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of the Puppet master vhost in Apache 2.4. The `SSLCARevocationCheck` directive, introduced in Apache 2.4, is set to "none" by default, and the default Puppet master vhost configuration does not explicitly enable it. As a result, the Puppet master does not check Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and thus continues to honor revoked certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is due to the missing `SSLCARevocationCheck` directive in the default Puppet master virtual host configuration.
- Failure to check for certificate revocation, thus accepting revoked client certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A revoked client certificate, if still honored by the Puppet master, could allow an attacker to maintain unauthorized access to the Puppet infrastructure even after their certificate has been revoked. This allows the attacker to continue controlling managed systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker who has previously compromised a system and obtained a valid client certificate for Puppet. After this certificate is revoked, if the Puppet master isn't configured to check revocation lists the attacker can continue to use their revoked certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a previously valid client certificate that has subsequently been revoked.
- The attacker would need to maintain the ability to use the revoked certificate (e.g. retain access to the private key associated with the certificate)
- The Puppet master server must be running on a system using Apache 2.4 or later where the `SSLCARevocationCheck` is not enabled, using the default Puppet master virtual host configuration.
