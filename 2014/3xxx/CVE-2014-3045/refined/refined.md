{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The administrative user's password can be read by the root user from the shell command history after changing the password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `chuser` command, used to change the administrative user password, is recorded in the shell command history of the root user. This exposes the new password in plain text.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious root user or an attacker who has gained root privileges can read the changed password of the administrative user from the shell command history. This can compromise the system's security by allowing unauthorized access to administrative functions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with root access or a malicious root user on the IBM SONAS system can read the shell command history.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have root user privileges on the IBM SONAS system."
