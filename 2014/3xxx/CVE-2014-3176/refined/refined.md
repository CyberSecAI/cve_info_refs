Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-3176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a combination of flaws found in the V8 JavaScript engine, IPC (Inter-Process Communication), sync mechanisms, and Chrome extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Multiple bugs in different parts of the Chrome browser were chained together, indicating a complex exploit scenario rather than a single, isolated vulnerability. The combination of vulnerabilities includes flaws in:
    *   V8 JavaScript engine
    *   IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
    *   Sync mechanisms
    *   Chrome Extensions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The exploitation of these chained vulnerabilities leads to remote code execution outside of the Chrome sandbox. This means an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the Chrome process, potentially compromising the entire machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is likely remote, as the vulnerability is exploitable through the browser. The attacker would likely need to craft malicious web content to trigger the vulnerability chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious content to a user running a vulnerable version of Chrome. This could be through a compromised website, a malicious ad, or any other method that can deliver web content to the victim.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by "lokihardt@asrt" who received a significant reward for reporting this issue.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Chromium version 37.0.2062.94.
*   The fix was included in security updates for various Linux distributions like Debian and openSUSE.
