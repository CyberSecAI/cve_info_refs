Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenStack Keystone handles chained delegation via trusts and OAuth tokens. Specifically, a user with a trust or OAuth token that has limited privileges can circumvent these limitations by creating another trust or OAuth delegation, effectively escalating their privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Chained Delegation Bypass:**  The core weakness is the ability to chain delegations. A user, after receiving a delegated token with limited scope, could create a new delegation with broader scope, exceeding the initial delegation's intended restrictions.
- **Improper Scope Enforcement:** The system failed to properly enforce the scope of delegated privileges when creating new trusts or OAuth delegations from existing delegated tokens.
- **Trust and OAuth Token Abuse:** Both trust and OAuth tokens could be exploited to create new delegations that bypassed intended privilege limitations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could escalate their privileges to any role of the trustor, potentially gaining administrative access or other sensitive capabilities.
- **Circumvention of Intended Security:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the intended access control mechanisms provided by Keystone's trust and OAuth delegation features.
- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** By escalating privileges, attackers could potentially gain access to resources or perform actions that they were not authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Chaining of Trusts:**
    1. User1 delegates some roles (e.g., `heat_stack_owner`) to User2 using a trust.
    2. User2 receives a trust-scoped token that impersonates User1.
    3. User2 uses this trust-scoped token to create another trust, delegating roles including `admin` to User3.
    4. User3, now with an escalated trust, can use the `admin` role.
- **Chaining of OAuth Delegations:**
     1. User is granted limited privileges via OAuth delegation.
     2. User uses OAuth delegation to generate a new OAuth delegation with elevated privileges.
- **OAuth to Trust or Trust to OAuth:**
    1. A user authenticated through OAuth can create a trust with elevated privileges.
    2. A user authenticated through a trust can create an OAuth delegation with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Keystone:** The attacker needs to have access to an OpenStack environment using Keystone.
- **Existing Trust or OAuth token:** The attacker needs to have received an initial trust or OAuth token with some privileges. This token does not need to have the escalated privileges but must be a delegated token (e.g. not an explicit user token).
- **Ability to Create Trusts/OAuth delegation:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to create new trusts or OAuth delegations within Keystone.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affected OpenStack Keystone versions up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1.
- The vulnerability was present in the Master, Icehouse, and Havana branches.
- The fix was to prevent the creation of new trusts or OAuth delegations using existing delegated auth tokens.
- Disabling trust functionality is possible as a workaround, however it would significantly limit the functionality of services such as Heat.
