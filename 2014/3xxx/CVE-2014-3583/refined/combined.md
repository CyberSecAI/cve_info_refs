RHSA-2015:1858 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2015-10-01
Updated:
2015-10-01
# RHSA-2015:1858 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: mod\_proxy\_fcgi and ceph security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

Updated mod\_proxy\_fcgi and ceph packages that fix one security issue and
several bugs are now available for CentOS 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage
system with a Ceph management platform, deployment tools, and support
services.

The mod\_proxy\_fcgi package provides a proxy module for the Apache 2.2 HTTP
server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_fcgi's handle\_headers()
function. A malicious FastCGI server that httpd is configured to connect to
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause an httpd child
process handling the request to crash. (CVE-2014-3583)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The RADOS gateway (RGW) can now properly decode the slash characters

("/") in clients' upload IDs. (BZ#1183182)

* The RGW's object attribute updates could race with other object updates

operations, which led to inconsistent object states, such as incomplete
object deletions. RGW now handles attribute updates correctly. (BZ#1206963)

* Recreating a previously existing bucket in RGW did not remove the bucket

instance metadata object and created a redundant object in the RGW pool.
The redundant objects are no longer generated. (BZ#1212524)

* The Content-Length header is now correctly created when creating a

container using the Swift API. (BZ#1213988)

* RGW did not properly cache users' keystone tokens and validated all

keystone tokens for every Swift operation. RGW now caches tokens correctly,
so that the token validation occurs only when necessary. (BZ#1213999)

* Modifying a user's Access Control List (ACL) permissions for an object in

RGW inappropriately caused the user to become the owner of the object.
This update fixes this bug. (BZ#1214051)

* RGW could fail to update the bucket attributes during a Swift API "POST"

operation. RGW now correctly updates the bucket attributes. (BZ#1214058)

* RGW no longer terminated unexpectedly when using keystone authentication

to copy an object. (BZ#1214061)

* An attempt to download an object greater than 512 KB using a range header

failed when using the Swift API. Objects can now be downloaded as expected.
(BZ#1214854)

* When using OpenStack's Cinder RADOS Block Device (RBD) back-end driver

with Ceph administration socket enabled, Ceph could leak file descriptors
and eventually consume the maximum number of allowed opened files.
This behavior caused Cinder's RBD connections to fail. Now, Ceph closes the
administration socket appropriately. (BZ#1220496)

* When a part of a multi-part object was resent, the object became broken

due a discrepancy between the object size when listing the object and when
stating the object. Now, multi-part objects no longer become broken in such
a case. (BZ#1222091)

* When the number of placement groups (PGs) in a pool was increased, Ceph

did not send watch or notify operations correctly. Consequently, the librbd
library presented inconsistent RBD snapshot data. Now, Ceph correctly
re-sends operations. (BZ#1245785)

* When reopening log files, Object Storage Devices (OSDs) could write data

to the incorrect file descriptor. Consequently, log entries were lost, or
were written to a file descriptor, which was opened by the filestore.
The latter case could cause data corruption. This bug has been fixed.
(BZ#1247752)

All mod\_proxy\_fcgi and ceph users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Synopsis

Low: mod\_proxy\_fcgi security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1855)

## Topic

An updated mod\_proxy\_fcgi package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage
system with a Ceph management platform, deployment tools, and support
services.

The mod\_proxy\_fcgi package provides a proxy module for the Apache 2.2 HTTP
server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_fcgi's handle\_headers()
function. A malicious FastCGI server that httpd is configured to connect to
could send a carefully crafted response that would cause an httpd child
process handling the request to crash. (CVE-2014-3583)

All mod\_proxy\_fcgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which corrects this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-13 02:36:35 UTC  ``` The following flaw has been fixed in the Apache HTTP Server:  "A buffer overflow was found in mod_proxy_fcgi. A malicious FastCGI server could send a carefully crafted response which could lead to a heap buffer overflow."  Patch for trunk:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1638818>  External References:  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-13 02:38:47 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1163556](show_bug.cgi?id=1163556 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3583 httpd: mod_proxy_fcgi heap-based buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c2)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-11-13 08:52:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7, Red Hat Software Collections 1, Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 and 2, and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-14 12:35:38 UTC  ``` The affected mod_proxy_fcgi module was first introduced upstream in version 2.4 (or development version 2.3).  The httpd version 2.4 is currently only available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Software Collections 1.  Other Red Hat products that include httpd use older upstream versions (2.2 or 2.0) that do not include the mod_proxy_fcgi module.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-24 21:11:57 UTC  ``` This is a buffer over read issue in the handle_headers() function in mod_proxy_fcgi.  The function iterates over the input string buffer until it finds end of headers (delimited using \n\n or \r\n\r\n, or until \0 if found to indicate end of string).  Before the fix, the function did not get the length of the buffer, or pointer to its end, so it could not detect end of buffer and prevent read past the end of buffer.  In httpd 2.4.10, the buffer passed to the handle_headers() can either be stack or heap based.  Only stack based buffer is used in earlier versions.  This issue can be triggered by a malicious FastCGI server that httpd is configured to connect to.  It may also be triggered if non-malicious FastCGI server is made to generate a response with unexpectedly large headers.  Considering that over read stops when the first \0 byte is encountered, this seems unlikely to lead to easily reproducible crash.  Additionally, crash would be limited to a specific httpd child process handling the request.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-25 12:25:42 UTC  ``` This flaw was introduced via the following commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1594537>  Prior to the change, the code ensured that the buffer passed to the handle_headers() function was always properly NUL terminated, as was expected by the function.  The change was added in the httpd upstream version 2.4.10, which is the only version affected by this flaw.  The upstream vulnerabilities page is now updated to no longer list 2.4.1 - 2.4.9 as affected by this issue.  The httpd packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Software Collections 1 are based on upstream version 2.4.6 and were not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-25 12:29:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c5)) > In httpd 2.4.10, the buffer passed to the handle_headers() can either be > stack or heap based.  Only stack based buffer is used in earlier versions.  Relevant upstream commit is:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1601749>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c10)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-28 10:22:48 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.10-2.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1163555#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-03-16 01:41:37 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.10-15.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

| Reported to security team | 2024-07-09 |

| Update 2.4.62 released | 2024-07-17 |
| Affects | 2.4.60 through 2.4.61 |

### important: Apache HTTP Server: SSRF with mod\_rewrite in server/vhost context on Windows ([CVE-2024-40898](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40898))

SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod\_rewrite in server/vhost context, allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62 which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-39884](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39884))

A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.61, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51

### critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773) ([CVE-2021-42013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42013))

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### moderate: null pointer dereference in h2 fuzzing ([CVE-2021-41524](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41524))

While fuzzing the 2.4.49 httpd, a new null pointer dereference was detected during HTTP/2 request processing,

allowing an external source to DoS the server. This requires a specially crafted request.

The vulnerability was recently introduced in version 2.4.49. No exploit is known to the project.

### critical: Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 ([CVE-2021-41773](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41773))

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

When mod\_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned.

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-36**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Apache, the worst of
which could lead to a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.25** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache. Please review
the CVE identifiers, upstream Apache Software Foundation documentation,
and HTTPoxy website referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition via multiple
vectors or response splitting and cache pollution. Additionally, an
attacker could intercept unsecured (HTTP) transmissions via the HTTPoxy
vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.4.25"

```

Advisory: Apache Software Foundation Projects and "httpoxy" CERT VU#797896
Canonical URL: https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt
Publication: v1.0 18 July 2016
Audience
--------
This Advisory is directed to HTTP web server administrators and users of
the software indicated below, including CGI developers.
This Advisory is not directed to a general audience, especially web browser
users. The issues raised by the "httpoxy" class of vulnerabilities affect
web servers, and are not an issue for consumers of web services to address.
Background
----------
The ASF (Apache Software Foundation) offers a number of software packages
which offer HTTP protocol ("Web") requests and responses, and offer the
developer or administrator CGI (Common Gateway Interface) routing through
these software packages.
The Apache HTTP Server (httpd and mod\_fcgid), Apache Perl (mod\_perl) and
Apache Tomcat projects all offer CGI handling of HTTP requests.
The Apache Traffic Server proxies HTTP requests, but offers no CGI support.
Many other ASF projects utilize the HTTP protocol, but at this time we have
not identified any which provide CGI handling, or forward the HTTP "Proxy:"
header implicated in the "httpoxy" class of issues. In the event that other
projects discover such a defect, or can contribute to mitigating this class
of issues, this Advisory will be updated.
Note especially that PHP (http://www.php.net) is not an Apache Software
Foundation project (this is a common point of confusion), and that this
Advisory does not attempt to address third-party software, scripts,
libraries or components affected by the "httpoxy" group of issues.
See https://httpoxy.org/ (not affiliated with the ASF) for a complete
discussion of the "httpoxy" class of issues, which are not reiterated
in this advisory.
The Apache Software Foundation wishes to thank Dominic Scheirlinck
and Scott Geary of Vend for bringing this issue to the attention of
the ASF Security Team for a well-coordinated community response.
Apache HTTP Server (httpd)
--------------------------
Apache HTTP Server may be configured to proxy HTTP requests as a forward
or reverse (gateway) proxy server, can proxy requests to a FastCGI service
using mod\_proxy\_fcgi, can directly serve CGI applications using mod\_cgi
or mod\_cgid or the related mod\_isapi service. The project's mod\_fcgid
subproject (available as a separate add-in module) directly manages CGI
scripts using the FastCGI protocol.
It may also be configured to directly host a number of external modules
which run CGI-style applications in-process. The server itself does not
modify the CGI environment in this case, however, these external modules
may perform such modifications of their environment variables in-process.
Such examples include mod\_php, mod\_perl and mod\_wsgi.
To mitigate "httpoxy" issues across all of the above mechanisms, the most
direct solution is to drop any "Proxy:" header arriving from an upstream
proxy server or the origin user-agent. this will mitigate the issue for any
vulnerable back-end server or CGI across all traffic through this server.
The two lines below enabled in the httpd.conf file will remove the "Proxy:"
header from all incoming requests, before further processing;
LoadModule headers\_module {path-to}/mod\_headers.so
RequestHeader unset Proxy early
(Users who have mod\_headers compiled-in to the httpd binary must omit
the LoadModule directive above, others must adjust the {path-to} to point
to the mod\_headers.so file.)
If the administrator wishes to preserve the value of the "Proxy:" header
for most traffic, and only eliminate it from the CGI environment variable
HTTP\_PROXY, a second mitigation is offered. This patch will address this
behavior in mod\_cgi, mod\_cgid, mod\_isapi, mod\_proxy\_fcgi and mod\_fcgid,
along with all other consumers of httpd's built-in environment handling.
The bundled httpd modules all rely on ap\_add\_common\_vars() to set up the
target CGI environment. The project will include the recommended patch
below in all subsequent releases of httpd, including 2.4.24 and 2.2.32.
Users who build httpd 2.2.x or 2.4.x from source may apply the patch below,
recompile and re-install httpd to obtain this mitigation. This migitation
has been assigned the identifier CVE-2016-5387 .

Apache HTTP Server (mod\_fcgid)
------------------------------
Either mitigation listed above for Apache HTTP Server (httpd) guidance above
also mitigates all risks for CGI's which are invoked by mod\_fcgid. Therefore
any CVE with respect to mod\_fcgid is revoked as duplicate of CVE-2016-5387.
Apache Perl Module (mod\_perl)
-----------------------------
Either mitigation listed for Apache HTTP Server (httpd) guidance above
also mitigates "httpoxy" risks for requests which are served by mod\_perl.
Note also that the Perl LWP::HTTP package has long avoided recognizing
the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable, when serving CGI requests.
Apache Tomcat
-------------
Apache Tomcat provides a CGI Servlet that allows to execute a CGI
script. The CGI Servlet isn't active in the configuration delivered by
the ASF and activating it requires the user to modify the web.xml delivered.
To mitigate "httpoxy" issues in CGI Servlet there are 3 possible ways:
1 - Add a filter in the webapp that uses CGI scripts simple code to
reject the requests with PROXY headers via 400 "bad request" error.
Map the filter in web.xml of the webapp. Code like the following will
allow that:
+++
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
/\*
\* Simple filter
\*/
public class PoxyFilter implements Filter {
protected FilterConfig filterConfig;
public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
this.filterConfig = filterConfig;
}
public void destroy() {
this.filterConfig = null;
}
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,
FilterChain chain) throws java.io.IOException,
ServletException {
HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)request;
HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse)response;
String poxy = req.getHeader("proxy");
if (poxy == null) {
// call next filter in the chain.
chain.doFilter(request, response);
} else {
res.sendError(400);
}
}
}
+++
2 - Add a global valve to reject requests with PROXY header, create a
PoxyValve.java with below content, compile it and put it in a jar and
put the jar in the lib installation of your tomcat. Add the line  in conf/server.xml (like after the
AccessLogValve) and restart Tomcat:
+++
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import org.apache.catalina.valves.ValveBase;
import org.apache.catalina.connector.Request;
import org.apache.catalina.connector.Response;
import org.apache.catalina.Context;
import org.apache.catalina.Realm;
import org.apache.catalina.Session;
public class PoxyValve
extends ValveBase {
public void invoke(Request request, Response response)
throws IOException, ServletException {
String poxy = request.getHeader("Proxy");
if (poxy != null) {
response.sendError(400);
return;
}
getNext().invoke(request, response);
}
}
+++
3 - Fix the CGIServlet code with the following patch and recompile
Tomcat and replace the catalina.jar by the produced one in you
installation and restart Tomcat:
+++
--- java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java (revision 1724080)
+++ java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java (working copy)

+ "PROXY\_AUTHORIZATION".equalsIgnoreCase(header) ||
+ "PROXY".equalsIgnoreCase(header)) {
//NOOP per CGI specification section 11.2
} else {
envp.put("HTTP\_" + header.replace('-', '\_'),
+++
A mitigation is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as
CVE-2016-5388, which will allow the user to prevent values like
HTTP\_PROXY from being propagated to the CGI Servlet environment.
Apache Traffic Server (ATS)
---------------------------
Apache Traffic Server is unaffected by this class of vulnerabilities, as
it provides no direct CGI or FastCGI request handling. As a proxy server,
ATS may be configured to route requests to vulnerable CGI applications as
described by the "httpoxy" class of exploits.
Apache Traffic Server can be configured to drop the HTTP "Proxy:" request
header from incoming requests as a mitigation, to prevent this request
header from being forwarded to potentially unhardened backend servers.
One configuration to strip the Proxy header is:
/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/plugin.config
header\_rewrite.so strip\_proxy.conf
/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/strip\_proxy.conf
cond %{READ\_REQUEST\_HDR\_HOOK}
rm-header Proxy

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Applications

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 78 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 69 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2016), [My Oracle Support Note 2072202.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2072202.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.
