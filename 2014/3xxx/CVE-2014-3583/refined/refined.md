{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `handle_headers()` function of the `mod_proxy_fcgi` module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious FastCGI server can send a specially crafted response with long headers that causes the httpd child process to crash, leading to a denial of service. In some cases, this may lead to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending crafted response via a FastCGI server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must control or have access to a FastCGI server that the vulnerable Apache HTTP Server is configured to connect to.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the `handle_headers()` function iterating over the input buffer without proper bounds checking. The function searches for end-of-header markers (\\n\\n or \\r\\n\\r\\n) or the end-of-string marker (\\0), but does not validate the length of the buffer, allowing reads beyond the buffer's boundary when receiving a response with unexpectedly long headers. The buffer passed to `handle_headers()` can be either stack or heap-based, with the stack-based buffer being used in earlier versions, while heap based can exist in newer versions like 2.4.10."
