Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3438:

**CVE-2014-3438:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the URLs `https://<HOST>:8443/console/Highlander_docs/SSO-Error.jsp?ErrorMsg=` and `https://<HOST>:8443/portal/Loading.jsp?uri=`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `ErrorMsg` and `uri` URL parameters.
    *   Reflected XSS: The injected malicious script is reflected back to the user via the HTTP response, allowing execution of the script in the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Session hijacking: An attacker can steal session identifiers from other users.
    *   Account impersonation: An attacker can impersonate other users and gain unauthorized access to the admin interface.
    *   Unauthorized access: An attacker can gain full access to the admin interface via the compromised user session.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious link: An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it.
    *   Phishing: An attacker can craft a phishing email that redirects a user to the malicious URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious URL to a user of the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager.
    *   The victim user must click on the malicious link while logged into the application, allowing the attacker to steal the userâ€™s session.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Symantec Endpoint Protection version 12.1.4023.4080.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 12.1.5 RU5.
*   The provided document includes example URLs for demonstration purposes.
