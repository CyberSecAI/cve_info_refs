Package: duplicity
Version: 0.6.24-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1109999>

Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security reported [1] that Duplicity did not
handle wildcard certificates properly.  If Duplicity were to connect to a remote
host that used a wildcard certificate, and the hostname does not match the
wildcard, it would still consider the connection valid.

I tried to access the above URL, and nothing happens there. Is this an error or an embargoed ticket ?

It also seems that this CVE doesn't appear in launchpad's duplicity CVEs, but again, that may just be embargoed and masked without further notice ?

If you have more details, that may be useful.

Thanks in advance.

retitle 751902 "duplicity should enable boto's certificate verification option"
severity 751902 normal
forwarded 751902 [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234)
thanks

i'm downgrading this bug to normal severity, as the issue affects only one
(of about a dozen) different storage backends in duplicity (actually the only
purely commercial backend).

Given that this is unfixed upstream for years, let's exclude the backend from
the Debian binary package?

no, i don't want to do that.

as of python-boto 2.6, certificate validation is auto-enabled. pity
that that's not in debian yet... <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html> (or is it 2.45? utter confusion seems to reign over there...)

having looked at this now it seems easy to simply hack
the 'mandatory not optional' part into the debian version.

according to the release notes for boto 2.6.0
at <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html>
boto's default is now to enable certificate verification.
(before that version it was opt-in, which duplicity never got around to.)

given this and the versions of python-boto in stable and unstable
(2.34 and newer) there's nothing left to do for duplicity
and i'm therefore closing this bug.

### Bug Description

While doing some testing using deja-dup I noticed that the SSL certificate that Amazon S3 was providing wasn't correct.

$ openssl s\_client -connect s3-1-w.amazonaws.com:443 -crlf

CONNECTED(00000003)

depth=3 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority

verify return:1

depth=2 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = "(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", CN = VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5

verify return:1

depth=1 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10, CN = VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3

verify return:1

depth=0 C = US, ST = Washington, L = Seattle, O = Amazon.com Inc., CN = \*.s3.amazonaws.com

verify return:1

   i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority

The Amazon certificate is a wildcard cert for \*.s3.amazonaws.com. Unfortunately the domain duplicity was connecting to was s3-1-w.amazonaws.com. Duplicity should have verified that the certificate was valid for the domain it was connected to.

I am not entirely sure what the answer should be. If we 'fail' the

connection and refuse to accept a mis-applied wildcard, we'll probably fail

most connections (there are a bunch of systems in a bunch of companies set

up like this). We could 'warn' in this case, but that just creates more

noise.

My best guess would be to accept if the domain matches, 'amazonaws.com',

and fail if it does not. Tricky.

I think that, at the very least, a warning should come up. Otherwise, failing to fail the connection means that someone could launch a MITM attack easily.

I should note that I've already contacted Amazon about the certificate error.

Is it not possible to have a configurable option? Sounds like the best compromise. Do the right thing by default, and allow people who are in certain situations to configure it to allow for the wrong behavior. That way if there is ever a problem, it was because they chose the more insecure default.

Otherwise you're stuck building white- and black-lists which is just annoying for everyone.

Anything further on this? It's been a few weeks and we'd like to make this public so we're not sitting on it forever. If there is no objection, we would like to open our bug on June 11, 2014 at about 16:00 UTC, although ideally we'd like to do so with some guidance for a fix or patch.

Thanks.

I found an error in the way you are running the openssl command, it should

include the -CAcert option. See the man page for s\_client. Running with

that yields a clean verification:

ken@stealth:~$ openssl s\_client -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect

I wasn't using openssl s\_client for anything other than to show you that the certificate isn't valid for the domain. When Duplicity connects to Amazon it is connecting to the domain s3-1-w.amazonaws.com which is using a certificate for \*.s3.amazonaws.com. SSLLabs also complains about this mismatch (<https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=s3-1-w.amazonaws.com>).

Duplicity is \*not\* complaining about this certificate error meaning that it's not validating the certificate at all.

i am not familiar with the details of how the validation needs to be done. but actually we probably don't need to - we use boto to access s3 and

 <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/boto-users/6k_KA9UeQ5E>

suggests it has an option for that. which only needs to be enabled.

we should probably tie the switching of that option to the command line parameters i created for webdavs '--ssl-cacert-file' & '--ssl-no-check-certificate'.

Eric: would you mind implementing this for the recent 0.7 devel branch?

Any progress? Or can we file our public bug regarding this? I had meant to do so on Wednesday, but forgot about it. I don't think there's a reason to keep this embargoed. If I hear nothing in the next few hours I'll go ahead and file our bug. It would be nice if we could link to a patch though.

Thanks.

according to the boto release notes for 2.6.0 (<http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html>), boto now defaults to certificate verification ON instead of opt-in.

i think that's pretty much it, given that boto is now at version 2.45 or so.

if that is considered not certain enough, then i think all that's necessary would be to

adjust duplicity/backends/\_boto\_single.py where storage\_uri.connect() is called and change those

calls so that the validate\_certs option is explicitely given.

stable is now boto3, any reason why we still stick with the boto2 ?

nack.. that would break backward compatibility. we could do that for 0.8.x though..

We will need to update to boto3 eventually, I think. Boto just hit 2.45

just a month ago. What's unclear is when validate\_certs became a

parameter, and whether it has maintained that name throughout. A simple

fix would be to add a kwargs parameter for anything above a set version,

but then we'd have to add another argument to duplicity to allow the user

to turn it off in some situations.

I am guessing that this was fixed ages ago for the reasons given in the Debian tracker:

"according to the release notes for boto 2.6.0

at <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html>

boto's default is now to enable certificate verification.

(before that version it was opt-in, which duplicity never got around to.)

given this and the versions of python-boto in stable and unstable

(2.34 and newer) there's nothing left to do for duplicity

and i'm therefore closing this bug.

"

It would be great if there is someone with the right setup to confirm, though, so that we can close this off.

## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [duplicity](/tracker/source-package/duplicity) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/duplicity)) | bullseye | 0.8.17-1 | fixed |
|  | bookworm | 0.8.22-1 | fixed |
|  | sid, trixie | 3.0.3.2-1 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [duplicity](/tracker/source-package/duplicity) | source | (unstable) | 0.6.21-1 | low |  | [751902](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=751902) |

## Notes

```
[wheezy] - duplicity <no-dsa> (Minor issue)
Since python-boto 2.6.0, cf. #751902, boto's default is now to enable
certificate verification. This is as such only a issue if using boto's
version outside of the packaged one in Debian. Mark 0.6.21-1 as fixing
version since this is the first upload to unstable after python-boto
2.8.0-1 was uploaded.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-16 19:45:26 UTC  ``` Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security reported [1] that Duplicity did not handle wildcard certificates properly.  If Duplicity were to connect to a remote host that used a wildcard certificate, and the hostname does not match the wildcard, it would still consider the connection valid.  The example of which is provided:  $ openssl s_client -connect s3-1-w.amazonaws.com:443 -crlf CONNECTED(00000003) depth=3 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority verify return:1 depth=2 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = "(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", CN = VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5 verify return:1 depth=1 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10, CN = VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3 verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, ST = Washington, L = Seattle, O = Amazon.com Inc., CN = *.s3.amazonaws.com verify return:1 --- Certificate chain  0 s:/C=US/ST=Washington/L=Seattle/O=Amazon.com Inc./CN=*.s3.amazonaws.com    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3  1 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5  2 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority  In this instance, the domain being connected to is not *.s3.amazonaws.com, but s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.  There is currently no upstream fix.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234)   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-16 19:49:57 UTC  ```  Created duplicity tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1110003](show_bug.cgi?id=1110003 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3495 duplicity: improper verification of SSL certificates [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1110004](show_bug.cgi?id=1110004 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3495 duplicity: improper verification of SSL certificates [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c2)  Henri Salo    2014-06-18 19:44:14 UTC  ``` Do you have information why [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234) does not work? Is this embargoed issue?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-18 21:00:47 UTC  ``` Indeed it is.  I don't know why it still is.  We had communicated quite clearly that we didn't want to sit on this forever and had a deadline that we missed twice I think.  When this bug was filed public, I let them know so I'm not sure why they've not opened it up yet.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c4)  Rahul Sundaram    2014-06-19 15:12:17 UTC  ``` Not sure I can do much without an upstream fix.  So I guess I will just wait unless someone else provides a patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c5)  Henri Salo    2014-06-19 15:32:15 UTC  ``` I contacted upstream. Reference URL is now open.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c6)  Rahul Sundaram    2014-06-19 16:03:28 UTC  ``` Subscribed.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-08 02:33:38 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-16 19:45:26 UTC  ``` Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security reported [1] that Duplicity did not handle wildcard certificates properly.  If Duplicity were to connect to a remote host that used a wildcard certificate, and the hostname does not match the wildcard, it would still consider the connection valid.  The example of which is provided:  $ openssl s_client -connect s3-1-w.amazonaws.com:443 -crlf CONNECTED(00000003) depth=3 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority verify return:1 depth=2 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = "(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", CN = VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5 verify return:1 depth=1 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10, CN = VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3 verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, ST = Washington, L = Seattle, O = Amazon.com Inc., CN = *.s3.amazonaws.com verify return:1 --- Certificate chain  0 s:/C=US/ST=Washington/L=Seattle/O=Amazon.com Inc./CN=*.s3.amazonaws.com    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3  1 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5  2 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority  In this instance, the domain being connected to is not *.s3.amazonaws.com, but s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.  There is currently no upstream fix.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234)   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-16 19:49:57 UTC  ```  Created duplicity tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1110003](show_bug.cgi?id=1110003 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3495 duplicity: improper verification of SSL certificates [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1110004](show_bug.cgi?id=1110004 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2014-3495 duplicity: improper verification of SSL certificates [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c2)  Henri Salo    2014-06-18 19:44:14 UTC  ``` Do you have information why [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234) does not work? Is this embargoed issue?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-18 21:00:47 UTC  ``` Indeed it is.  I don't know why it still is.  We had communicated quite clearly that we didn't want to sit on this forever and had a deadline that we missed twice I think.  When this bug was filed public, I let them know so I'm not sure why they've not opened it up yet.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c4)  Rahul Sundaram    2014-06-19 15:12:17 UTC  ``` Not sure I can do much without an upstream fix.  So I guess I will just wait unless someone else provides a patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c5)  Henri Salo    2014-06-19 15:32:15 UTC  ``` I contacted upstream. Reference URL is now open.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c6)  Rahul Sundaram    2014-06-19 16:03:28 UTC  ``` Subscribed.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1109999#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-08 02:33:38 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-06-19 09:25:47 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Eric Christensen of Red Hat Product Security reported [1] that Duplicity did not handle wildcard certificates properly.  If Duplicity were to connect to a remote host that used a wildcard certificate, and the hostname does not match the wildcard, it would still  consider the connection valid.  The example of which is provided:  $ openssl s_client -connect s3-1-w.amazonaws.com:443 -crlf CONNECTED(00000003) depth=3 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority verify return:1 depth=2 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = "(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", CN = VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5 verify return:1 depth=1 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10, CN = VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3 verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, ST = Washington, L = Seattle, O = Amazon.com Inc., CN = *.s3.amazonaws.com verify return:1 --- Certificate chain  0 s:/C=US/ST=Washington/L=Seattle/O=Amazon.com Inc./CN=*.s3.amazonaws.com    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3  1 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5  2 s:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=VeriSign Trust Network/OU=(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only/CN=VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5    i:/C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority  In this instance, the domain being connected to is not *.s3.amazonaws.com, but s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.  There is currently no upstream fix.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1314234](https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/%2Bbug/1314234)    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-07-19 13:41:47 UTC  ``` The reported issue is that a wildcard SSL certificate, which is issued to an owner of a particular domain, is not valid.  As such, if you are willing to accept such a certificate then you are trusting the owner of that domain in it's entirety.  If we really broke this down, someone owning amazonaws.com should answer all DNS requests for that particular domain.  If you are not willing to trust this then hardening is the proper approach.  Furthermore, the original reporter in the upstream bug did not properly validate against the CA with the proper OpenSSL option of -CACert. ``` |  |

### Bug Description

While doing some testing using deja-dup I noticed that the SSL certificate that Amazon S3 was providing wasn't correct.

$ openssl s\_client -connect s3-1-w.amazonaws.com:443 -crlf

CONNECTED(00000003)

verify return:1

depth=2 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = "(c) 2006 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", CN = VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5

verify return:1

depth=1 C = US, O = "VeriSign, Inc.", OU = VeriSign Trust Network, OU = Terms of use at <https://www.verisign.com/rpa> (c)10, CN = VeriSign Class 3 Secure Server CA - G3

verify return:1

depth=0 C = US, ST = Washington, L = Seattle, O = Amazon.com Inc., CN = \*.s3.amazonaws.com

verify return:1

The Amazon certificate is a wildcard cert for \*.s3.amazonaws.com. Unfortunately the domain duplicity was connecting to was s3-1-w.amazonaws.com. Duplicity should have verified that the certificate was valid for the domain it was connected to.

I am not entirely sure what the answer should be. If we 'fail' the

connection and refuse to accept a mis-applied wildcard, we'll probably fail

most connections (there are a bunch of systems in a bunch of companies set

up like this). We could 'warn' in this case, but that just creates more

noise.

My best guess would be to accept if the domain matches, 'amazonaws.com',

and fail if it does not. Tricky.

I think that, at the very least, a warning should come up. Otherwise, failing to fail the connection means that someone could launch a MITM attack easily.

I should note that I've already contacted Amazon about the certificate error.

Is it not possible to have a configurable option? Sounds like the best compromise. Do the right thing by default, and allow people who are in certain situations to configure it to allow for the wrong behavior. That way if there is ever a problem, it was because they chose the more insecure default.

Otherwise you're stuck building white- and black-lists which is just annoying for everyone.

Is it not possible to have a configurable option? Sounds like the best compromise. Do the right thing by default, and allow people who are in certain situations to configure it to allow for the wrong behavior. That way if there is ever a problem, it was because they chose the more insecure default.
Otherwise you're stuck building white- and black-lists which is just annoying for everyone.

Anything further on this? It's been a few weeks and we'd like to make this public so we're not sitting on it forever. If there is no objection, we would like to open our bug on June 11, 2014 at about 16:00 UTC, although ideally we'd like to do so with some guidance for a fix or patch.

Thanks.

I found an error in the way you are running the openssl command, it should

include the -CAcert option. See the man page for s\_client. Running with

I wasn't using openssl s\_client for anything other than to show you that the certificate isn't valid for the domain. When Duplicity connects to Amazon it is connecting to the domain s3-1-w.amazonaws.com which is using a certificate for \*.s3.amazonaws.com. SSLLabs also complains about this mismatch (<https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=s3-1-w.amazonaws.com>).

Duplicity is \*not\* complaining about this certificate error meaning that it's not validating the certificate at all.

i am not familiar with the details of how the validation needs to be done. but actually we probably don't need to - we use boto to access s3 and

 <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/boto-users/6k_KA9UeQ5E>

suggests it has an option for that. which only needs to be enabled.

we should probably tie the switching of that option to the command line parameters i created for webdavs '--ssl-cacert-file' & '--ssl-no-check-certificate'.

Eric: would you mind implementing this for the recent 0.7 devel branch?

Any progress? Or can we file our public bug regarding this? I had meant to do so on Wednesday, but forgot about it. I don't think there's a reason to keep this embargoed. If I hear nothing in the next few hours I'll go ahead and file our bug. It would be nice if we could link to a patch though.

Thanks.

according to the boto release notes for 2.6.0 (<http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html>), boto now defaults to certificate verification ON instead of opt-in.

i think that's pretty much it, given that boto is now at version 2.45 or so.

if that is considered not certain enough, then i think all that's necessary would be to

adjust duplicity/backends/\_boto\_single.py where storage\_uri.connect() is called and change those

calls so that the validate\_certs option is explicitely given.

stable is now boto3, any reason why we still stick with the boto2 ?

nack.. that would break backward compatibility. we could do that for 0.8.x though..

We will need to update to boto3 eventually, I think. Boto just hit 2.45

just a month ago. What's unclear is when validate\_certs became a

parameter, and whether it has maintained that name throughout. A simple

fix would be to add a kwargs parameter for anything above a set version,

but then we'd have to add another argument to duplicity to allow the user

to turn it off in some situations.

I am guessing that this was fixed ages ago for the reasons given in the Debian tracker:

"according to the release notes for boto 2.6.0

at <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/releasenotes/v2.6.0.html>

boto's default is now to enable certificate verification.

(before that version it was opt-in, which duplicity never got around to.)

given this and the versions of python-boto in stable and unstable

(2.34 and newer) there's nothing left to do for duplicity

and i'm therefore closing this bug.

"

It would be great if there is someone with the right setup to confirm, though, so that we can close this off.
