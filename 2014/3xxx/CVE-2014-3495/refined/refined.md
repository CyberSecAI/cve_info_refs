{
  "CVE-2014-3495": {
    "Description": "duplicity 0.6.24 has improper verification of SSL certificates",
    "Root cause": "Duplicity was not properly validating SSL certificates when connecting to remote hosts, specifically when a wildcard certificate was used and the hostname did not match the wildcard pattern.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could potentially intercept and modify communications between Duplicity and the remote host by presenting a certificate with a mismatched wildcard pattern.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based MITM attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept network traffic and present a fraudulent SSL certificate.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability existed because duplicity was using an older version of the python boto library, which did not enable certificate validation by default",
        "The fix was addressed by upgrading to boto 2.6.0 where certificate validation was enabled by default and then explicitly enforcing the validation check.",
        "The vulnerability only affected the S3 backend of duplicity"
    ]
  }
}
