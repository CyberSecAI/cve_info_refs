Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-3571:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The vulnerability stems from OpenSSL's handling of DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) messages, specifically in the `dtls1_get_record` function within the `d1_pkt.c` file.
*   The core issue lies in a situation where, during the handshake process while in a listen state, OpenSSL performs separate reads for the handshake header and the handshake body. If a crafted message is received where the handshake header is read successfully, but the subsequent read for the handshake body fails, a NULL pointer `p` may be used, leading to a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   The `ssl3_read_n` function in `s3_pkt.c` is also involved as that is called by the vulnerable function

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **NULL pointer dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. The code doesn't properly validate the `p` pointer before using it.
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash caused by this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS), effectively disrupting the functionality of an affected OpenSSL server.

**3. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is the ability for a remote attacker to trigger a DoS, which may cause an application crash by sending specially crafted DTLS messages.
*   **Application Crash**: When a crafted DTLS message is processed with separate read operations for header and body, a NULL pointer dereference occurs, causing an application crash.
   * The application crash could affect any service linked to the OpenSSL library (e.g., httpd and other SSL-enabled services).

**4. Attack Vectors**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker over the network.
*   **Crafted DTLS Message:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted DTLS message to the targeted OpenSSL server. The message is crafted to cause the header to be read, but the subsequent read of the body to fail, triggering the NULL pointer.
*   **Specific handshake scenario**: the vulnerable code is specifically executed during the DTLS handshake when the connection is in the 'listen' state and receives a client hello message

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable OpenSSL server.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  No prior authentication is required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, as the handshake message is received early in the connection process.
*   **Ability to craft DTLS message:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malformed DTLS message with a valid header but with a body read failure.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected OpenSSL Versions:**
    *   OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd
    *   OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p
    *   OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k
*  **Cisco:** Cisco released an advisory, cisco-sa-20150310-ssl, indicating several Cisco products are vulnerable due to incorporating affected versions of OpenSSL. They provide workarounds and fixed versions for each affected product.
*   **SUSE:** SUSE has released multiple security advisories and updates addressing this issue, with fixes available in various SUSE Linux Enterprise products and versions. They also provide CVSS v2 scores.
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat has also released a security advisory RHSA-2015:0066 fixing this vulnerability in their packages and they also mention the possibility of a denial of service due to crafted DTLS messages.
*   **openSUSE:** openSUSE has also issued security updates for various openssl packages, addressing this and other CVEs.
*  **Apple:** Apple has addressed CVE-2014-3571 in OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and Security Update 2015-004.
*  **Fix from OpenSSL Github**
   * The commit `feba02f3919495e1b960c33ba849e10e77d0785d` and `248385c606620b29ecc96ca9d3603463f879652b` are identified as fixing the issue, with the former implementing a check and return of 0 to prevent using a null `p` pointer.

In summary, CVE-2014-3571 is a significant vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted DTLS messages to vulnerable OpenSSL servers. Multiple vendors have addressed this issue in their updates.
