Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3138

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Xerox DocuShare application. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the handling of the last URI segment of the `/docushare/dsweb/ResultBackgroundJobMultiple` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (specifically, the numeric parameter in the URL) before it's used in a database query.
*   **Multiple SQL Injection Types:** The vulnerability is exploitable using various SQL injection techniques, including:
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   Error-based SQL injection
    *   Stacked queries
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the DocuShare database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database, potentially corrupting information and impacting the application's functionality.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can allow attackers to gain higher privileges within the database, leading to further access and control.
*   **System Compromise:**  In severe cases, it might be possible to use the SQL injection to execute operating system commands, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is within the URI, specifically the last segment in the `/docushare/dsweb/ResultBackgroundJobMultiple/{parameter}` path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, even a "read-only" user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the DocuShare application to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the structure of the vulnerable URL and parameter to craft the injection payload.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Brandon Perry.
*   The vulnerable parameter is a numeric value, which is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   The database used by the application appears to be PostgreSQL.
*   The exploit can be automated using tools like sqlmap as shown in the provided content.
