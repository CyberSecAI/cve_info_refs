Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure install script in IBM's Embedded WebSphere Application Server (eWAS) version 7.0, which is bundled with IBM Security Directory Server and InfoSphere Identity Insight. This script, when executed, can lead to privilege escalation on UNIX platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Install Script:** The core issue is that the install script within eWAS 7.0 contains a flaw that allows for privilege escalation. The exact nature of the script's vulnerability is not specified but its execution with elevated permissions can lead to a security compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privileges:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain higher-level privileges on the system, which could range from local user privileges to root/administrator access.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With elevated privileges, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system, allowing for arbitrary code execution, data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Exploitation through eWAS Install Script:** The vulnerability is triggered through the execution of a flawed installation script provided with eWAS 7.0. This script is part of bundled packages for IBM Security Directory Server and InfoSphere Identity Insight.
*   **UNIX Platforms:** The vulnerability specifically affects UNIX-based platforms where the vulnerable script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** An attacker needs to have some form of access to a system running the affected products (IBM Tivoli Directory Server 6.3, IBM Security Directory Server 6.3.1, or InfoSphere Identity Insight v8.1 and 8.0) on a UNIX platform.
*   **Ability to Trigger the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker must be able to initiate the execution of the vulnerable eWAS 7.0 install script, likely through a local or initial access gained to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both IBM Security Directory Server and InfoSphere Identity Insight.
*   The provided content references a support flash that contains instructions on how to remediate this issue.
*   The fix involves upgrading to the recommended version of eWAS
