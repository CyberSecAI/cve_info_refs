# CVE-2014-3868: ZeusCart 4.x Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability

---

*From*: Kenny Mathis <kenny@breaking.technology>

*Date*: Tue, 24 Jun 2014 13:48:27 -0400

---

```

On May 27th our research labs discovered a vulnerability (CVE-2014-3868)
in an e-commerce shopping cart application known as "ZeusCart".  The
same day,
we reported this vulnerability to mitre.org and the CVE was assigned.
We were
able to get in touch with the vendor with a confirmed response relatively
quickly (May 29).

We attempted to contact them again on June 4 and June 17.  They have not
since
responded.

Since then there have been multiple pushes and merges to the project's
master
branch on github; the security issue still has not been addressed
despite the
fix being a single, simple line of code.  This copy-paste fix could have
been
implemented extremely quickly and easily and the vendor has pushed many
updates since their notification. When initially disclosing this, we gave
them a time period of 14 days before we would publish it.  Because they
responded to us positively, we gave them extra time to fix it.  At this
point,
seeing that they continue to update the software past the 14 day window
without implementing a ten second fix leaves us little alternative to our
present course of action.

As per our Actionable Intelligence Must Beget Overzealous Timing (AIMBOT)
policy, this report is being released in the hopes that vendor
negligence and
potential incompetence may be appropriately addressed.  Responsible
disclosure
includes the responsibility to be transparent with consumers and the
responsibility to consumers to prevent them from being harmed.

Before we get into any specific vulnerability, we would like to
compliment this
vendor on their UI development.  The responsive HTML5 layout is
certainly an
excellent piece of code.

While the vendor has amazing interface developers, their database
architects
are as poor at databasing as their UI developers are good at interfacing.

Our initial analysis of the software in question, including
CVE-2014-3868 and
several other vulnerabilities follows below.  Weaponized exploit samples
for
this software will NOT be made available by ourselves, as weaponizing
exploits
affecting this type of application is contrary to the spirit of consumer
protection.  We will attempt to provide diffs for each thing we were
able to
easily patch at the end of this document; however this is not a
guarantee of
the future safety of this third-party-patched product.

--- CVE-2014-3868 ---
Assigned:
    27 May 2014 (Submitted to Vendor May 29)

Status:
    Vendor Ignored, see suggested fix below.

Classification:
    Blind SQL Injection

Exploit Complexity:
    Low

Severity:
    High

Description:
    Blind SQL injection vector exists in the current addtocart
functionality
    for the latest version of ZeusCart.

    Required information for attack to be successful:
    * valid product id
    * valid session ID

PoC:
    * Requires a valid sessionid and numeric product id.
    * The following bash commands causes the target page to sleep for 13
      seconds, while the expected inputs have a near-instant response time:

    # export SESSID="YOURSESSIONID, CHANGE THIS";
    # export PROD_ID="Numeric Product ID";
    # time curl -d "addtocart=${PROD_ID}" -b "PHPSESSID=${SESSID}" \
      "<http://zeuscart_install/index.php?do=addtocart&prodid=${PROD_ID}> and
       sleep(1)"

Suggested Action:
    At the top of CAddCart.php, line 32 (just after the comments and
before the
    definition of the class), add the following line of code:

       $_GET['prodid'] = abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);

--- Initial Analysis ---
    The first thing we noticed was that Zeuscart uses
Bin/Core/Assembler.php to
automatically iterate over each user input and use
"mysql_real_escape_string"
on everything.  While the comments call this "power security", it is not.
Inputs that are not wrapped in quotes are not in any way protected.  Two
better
ways to implement "power security" include using PDO with paramaterized
statements or an ORM that sanitizes inputs according to datatypes in the
information_schema database.

    We were able to identify a number of sql injection vulnerabilities
which
involved integer handling bugs.  The following functions are vulnerable to
the following parameters:

    classes/Core/CUserNewsLetter.php:
        * addNewsLetter()            : $_POST['subId']      (line 72)

    classes/Core/CAddCart.php:
        * addCartFromProductDetail() : $_GET['prodid']      (lines 238, 379)
        * addCartFromProductDetail() : $_POST['variations'] (line 273)

    Eventually we stopped actually looking CAddCart.php and just ran a
fancy
grep to see queries that had string concatenated inputs that weren't
wrapped in
quotes.  The results were kind of scary, so, for CAddCart.php we simply
made a
list of vulnerable integer inputs with some magical bash:
    * $_GET['prodid']
    * $_POST['variations']
    * $_POST['prodid'][$i]
    * $_POST['qty'][$i]
    * $_POST['qty']

    Our greps also returned a fairly large amount of other
vulnerabilities. The
following filenames and line numbers showed as vulnerable for one reason or
another, we are limiting the information here due to the severity of the
bugs.
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:91
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:115
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:138
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:238
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:273
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:734
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:742
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:749
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:756
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:757
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:762
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:783
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:789
    ./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:905
    ./classes/Core/CUserNewsLetter.php:72
    ./classes/Display/DAddCart.php:277
    ./classes/Display/DAddCart.php:1146
    ./classes/Display/DAddCart.php:1161
    ./classes/Display/DAddCart.php:1326
    ./classes/Display/DAddCart.php:1341
    ./classes/Display/DUserAccount.php:1216

    Most major and obvious SQL injection bugs are fixed with our patch
to the
Assembler.php file; however we are not willing to vouch that there are
no SQL
injection vulnerabilities in our patched version.  This is only our initial
analysis and as such it is not complete.  This is simply what we were
able to
find and fix on our "first pass".

--- Our Patchset ---
While we have applied some best-effort hotfixes here, it is highly
recommended
to move to a software platform who's vendor takes security more
seriously until
the vendor officially patches these bugs amongst others.  Serious code
review
and standard enforcement is both lacking and needed by this vendor.

The diff is provided as follows:

  [root@temp Core]# diff Assembler.php Assembler_New.php
  47c47,73
  <
  ---
  >
  >                 if (isset($_POST['prodid'])) {
  >                     if (is_array($_POST['prodid'])) {
  >                         foreach ($_POST['prodid'] as $key => $value) {
  >                             $_POST['prodid'][$key] = abs((int)$value);
  >                         }
  >                     } else {
  >                         $_POST['prodid'] = abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);
  >                     }
  >                 }
  >
  >
  >                 if (isset($_POST['qty'])) {
  >                     if (is_array($_POST['qty'])) {
  >                         foreach ($_POST['qty'] as $key => $value) {
  >                             $_POST['qty'][$key] = abs((int)$value);
  >                         }
  >                     } else {
  >                         $_POST['qty'] = abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);
  >                     }
  >                 }
  >
  >                 if (isset($_POST['variations']))
$_POST['variations'] = abs((int)$_POST['variations']);
  >                 if (isset($_GET['prodid']))      $_GET['prodid']
  = abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);
  >                 if (isset($_POST['subId']))      $_POST['subId']
  = abs((int)$_POST['subId']);
  >
  >

Again, we would like to stress that this is NOT a guarantee of the
security of
this product.  This simply fixes the SQL injection vulnerabilities we
were able
to discover on our first glance.  If we were able to discover these
at-a-glance
then imagine what could potentially be in the wild.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
