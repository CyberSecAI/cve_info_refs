Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize integer inputs in the ZeusCart e-commerce application, specifically in `CAddCart.php`. The application uses `mysql_real_escape_string` on all inputs, but this function does not protect against SQL injection vulnerabilities when integers are concatenated into queries without being wrapped in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `addtocart` functionality of the application.
- **Unsanitized Integer Inputs:** Multiple integer inputs are directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. The following inputs are vulnerable:
    - `$_GET['prodid']`
    - `$_POST['variations']`
    - `$_POST['prodid'][$i]`
    - `$_POST['qty'][$i]`
    - `$_POST['qty']`
    - `$_POST['subId']` (in `CUserNewsLetter.php`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to the database, potentially enabling attackers to:
    - Read sensitive information, including user data, product details, and potentially payment information.
    - Modify data in the database, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
    - Potentially gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `addtocart` functionality via the following URL:
  `<http://zeuscart_install/index.php?do=addtocart&prodid=${PROD_ID}>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid session ID and a valid numeric product ID.
- The attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application using tools like `curl`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Vendor Negligence:** The vendor was notified of the vulnerability but failed to address it in a timely manner, despite multiple attempts to contact them.
- **Simple Fix:** The provided patch is a single line of code that casts the vulnerable parameters to integers using `abs((int)$_GET['prodid'])` and  `abs((int)$_POST['variations'])` .
- **Multiple Vulnerabilities:** The analysis revealed multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, beyond the one specific to `addtocart`.
- **Incomplete Patch:**  The provided patch only addresses the discovered SQL injection vulnerabilities on the first pass and is not a guarantee of the software's security.
- **Vulnerable Files:** The following files and lines are listed as vulnerable:
    - `./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:91`
    - `./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:115`
    - `./classes/Core/CAddCart.php:138`
