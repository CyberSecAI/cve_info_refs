{
  "CVE-2014-3801": {
    "Description": "OpenStack Heat would expose sensitive information over the network. Jason Dunsmore discovered that OpenStack heat did not properly restrict access to template information. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to see URL provider templates of other tenants for a limited time.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Heat handles provider templates. When a stack is created using a provider template, the URL of that template is temporarily stored in a global resource registry, making it visible to all tenants via the 'heat resource-type-list' command. This occurs during stack creation and disappears after a certain point in the process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage",
      "Lack of proper access control on template URLs"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user can temporarily view the URLs of provider templates belonging to other tenants. If these templates are publicly accessible, it may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like SSH keys, passwords, or server configurations contained within those templates.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network access via the Heat API",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a valid user with an account that is authenticated against the OpenStack environment. They need the ability to execute heat commands."
