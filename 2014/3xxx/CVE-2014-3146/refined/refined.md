Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3146:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `clean_html()` function in the `lxml.html.clean` module failed to properly sanitize HTML input containing non-printable control characters (specifically, `\x01-\x08`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `clean_html()` function did not remove or properly handle non-printable control characters in HTML input.
*   **Bypass of Sanitization:** The presence of these control characters allowed for bypassing the intended sanitization of HTML, specifically in URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  A remote attacker could inject malicious code into a website generated by an application using the vulnerable `clean_html()` function. By embedding such characters within the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag, they can bypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The browser will then execute the attacker-controlled JavaScript when the link is clicked.
*   **Malicious Content Injection:**  The attacker could serve malicious HTML content to users through a website or application using the vulnerable `clean_html()` function.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing crafted HTML input to an application that uses `lxml`'s `clean_html()` function.
*   **Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered when untrusted, attacker-controlled input is processed with the vulnerable function. The input would have to include non-printed characters in the javascript url.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to submit or control the HTML content processed by the vulnerable function.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to perform this attack.

**Technical details:**
The vulnerability lies in how `lxml`'s HTML cleaner handled certain control characters (\x01-\x08). These characters, when included in a `javascript:` URL scheme (e.g., `javas\x01cript:alert(1)`), would not be stripped, allowing the browser to execute the injected JavaScript.

The fix implemented in lxml 3.3.5 and later versions involves stripping these control characters from URL schemes before performing sanitization, preventing the execution of injected javascript.. The commit [e86b294f1f81b899a59925123560ff924a72f1cc](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/commit/e86b294f1f81b899a59925123560ff924a72f1cc) shows the change, which involves modifying the regex used in `clean.py` to include the control characters to strip.

The vulnerability was present in all versions of `lxml` including the latest (at the time) 3.3.4.

The advisory from Mageia and Ubuntu confirm this vulnerability and note that a patch was made.
