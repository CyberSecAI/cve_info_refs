Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3603

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `HttpResource` and `FileBackedHttpResource` implementations in OpenSAML Java and Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) use the Jakarta Commons HttpClient version 3.x.
*   This version of HttpClient does not perform hostname verification by default when establishing HTTPS connections. This means the client does not verify that the server it is communicating with is the intended server based on the certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Hostname Verification:** The core vulnerability is the absence of hostname verification during HTTPS connections. This means the client verifies the encrypted connection, but not that the connection is with the intended server.
*   **Vulnerable HttpClient:** The use of Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3.x, which is known to have this vulnerability, exacerbates the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by performing a MITM attack. The attacker intercepts the communication and presents a spoofed, but valid, certificate to the client.
*   **Data Compromise:** Since the client doesn't verify the hostname, it may send data to the attacker's server, leading to a potential compromise of sensitive information and/or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the legitimate server.
*   **Spoofing:** The attacker needs to obtain or create a certificate that is trusted but belongs to a different server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable client and a server.
*   **Certificate Spoofing:** The attacker must be capable of presenting a certificate that the client trusts. This typically requires either exploiting a certificate authority or generating a self-signed certificate that the client might still trust.
*   **Active Interception:** The attacker must be actively intercepting the connection at the time the vulnerable application attempts to access the resource.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to applications using the `HttpResource` or `FileBackedHttpResource` classes in OpenSAML Java and Shibboleth IdP.
*   The issue was addressed in OpenSAML Java version 2.6.2 and Shibboleth IdP version 2.4.1 by adding a hostname verifier.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry (Bug 1131823) indicates that certain Red Hat products were not affected because they use a patched version of Jakarta Commons HttpClient.
*   The shibboleth.net advisory also mentions that disabling `disregardSslCertificate` in IdP v2.4.0 and above can also disable hostname verification.
