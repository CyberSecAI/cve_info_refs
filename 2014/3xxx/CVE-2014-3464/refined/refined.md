{
  "Root cause": "The fix for CVE-2013-2133 was incomplete. JAX-WS handlers were executed for outbound messages even when authorization had failed.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability",
    "JAX-WS handlers executed without proper authorization checks"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker, authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS handler which they were not authorized to invoke.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote network access to JBoss server"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "Must be authorized to access EJB class",
    "Ability to invoke JAX-WS handlers"
  ]
}
