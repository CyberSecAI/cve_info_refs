Subject: CVE-2014-3672 libvirt: DoS via excessive logging

   Hello,

A while back, Mr Andrew Sorensen reported a Qemu logging issue wherein Libvirt
OR Xen directed 'stderr' of Qemu to a log file on the host.

This can be easily exploited by a user inside guest to flood the log file with
endless messages, resulting in a DoS situation on the host, affecting other
services and guests alike.

'CVE-2014-3672' was assigned to it by Red Hat Inc.

Until recently there was no remedy in sight, but quoting Mr Daniel P Berrange
of libvirt

   "Since libvirt version 1.3.3, libvirt has 'virtlogd' daemon running. The
    QEMU stdout/err are no longer connected directly to a file on disk, instead
    they go to a pipe connected to virtlogd. virtlogd only allows 128 kb of
    data to be written before rolling over the logs, and only keeps 3 backups,
    so there is no longer an uncontrolled denial of service.

    With QEMU 2.6, it is further possible to use virtlogd in association with
    QEMU serial ports that need to log to a file, for the same reason."

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=0d968ad715475a1660779bcdd2c5b38ad63db4cf>

Note: It's probably not feasible to back port this solution to older versions.

Thank you.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-3672 / XSA-180
                              version 2

                       Unrestricted qemu logging

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Normalize version tags.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When the libxl toolstack launches qemu for HVM guests, it pipes the
output of stderr to a file in /var/log/xen.  This output is not
rate-limited in any way.  The guest can easily cause qemu to print
messages to stderr, causing this file to become arbitrarily large.

IMPACT
======

The disk containing the logfile can be exausted, possibly causing a
denial-of-service (DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 systems are affected; ARM systems are not affected.

Only systems running HVM guests are affected; systems running only PV
guests are not affected.

Both qemu-upstream and qemu-traditional are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Sorensen of leviathansecurity.com.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

The patches adopt a simple and rather crude approach which is
effective at resolving the security issue in the context of a Xen
device model.  They may not be appropriate for adoption upstream or in
other contexts.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
