## Version 5.0.0 (2021-01-20)

### Summary

* Upgrade to ECMA-376 5th edition (transitional) schemas - expect API breaks when using XmlBeans directly
  some smaller changes are necessary when code is using the low-level CT... classes
* Change artifact names of poi-/ooxml-schemas to poi-ooxml-lite/full
* ooxml-security is part of poi-ooxml-full (known as ooxml-schemas) now and won't be provided separately
* updated dependencies to XMLSec 2.2.1, Bouncycastle 1.68, Commons-Codec 1.15, Commons-Compress 1.20
* XWPF - improvements in table and paragraph
* XSLF - improvements for paragraph
* provide JigSaw modules - some classes moved between packages for the JDK 9+ support, e.g.
  ExtractorFactory, so imports need to be adjusted
* removed dependencies to jaxb
* removed deprecated code
* new experimental DeferredSXSSFWorkbook which creates fewer temp files by lazily generating rows (see DeferredGeneration in poi-examples)

RHSA-2014:1399 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2014-10-13
Updated:
2014-10-13
# RHSA-2014:1399 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Apache POI security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache POI component that fixes two security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite
6.0.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache POI is a library providing Java API for working with OOXML document
files.

It was found that Apache POI would resolve entities in OOXML documents.
A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that are parsed by Apache
POI could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
application server, and potentially perform more advanced XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2014-3529)

It was found that Apache POI would expand an unlimited number of entities
in OOXML documents. A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that
are parsed by Apache POI could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service
attack via excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2014-3574)

All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the updates, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2014:1400 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Apache POI security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache POI component that fixes two security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss BRMS
6.0.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache POI is a library providing Java API for working with OOXML document
files.

It was found that Apache POI would resolve entities in OOXML documents.
A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that are parsed by Apache
POI could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
application server, and potentially perform more advanced XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2014-3529)

It was found that Apache POI would expand an unlimited number of entities
in OOXML documents. A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that
are parsed by Apache POI could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service
attack via excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2014-3574)

All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.3 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the updates, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Apache POI security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache POI component that fixes two security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss Data
Virtualization 6.0.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache POI is a library providing Java API for working with OOXML document
files.

It was found that Apache POI would resolve entities in OOXML documents.
A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that are parsed by Apache
POI could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
application server, and potentially perform more advanced XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2014-3529)

It was found that Apache POI would expand an unlimited number of entities
in OOXML documents. A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that
are parsed by Apache POI could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service
attack via excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2014-3574)

All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the updates, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

## 23 January 2025, Apache Solrâ¢ 9.8.0 available [Â¶](#apache-solrtm-980-available "Permanent link")

The Solr PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 9.8.0.

Solr is the blazing-fast, open source, multi-modal search platform built on Apache Lucene. It powers full-text, vector, analytics, and geospatial search at many of the world's largest organizations. Other major features include Kubernetes and docker integration, streaming, highlighting, faceting, and spellchecking.

Solr 9.8.0 is available for immediate download at:

<https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>

### Solr 9.8.0 Release Highlights:

* The Solr Cross-DC Project has graduated from the sandbox repository into the Solr project as a supported capability.
* Requests can specify the 'memAllowed' parameter to halt requests that have exceeded this amount of memory (similar to timeAllowed but for memory).
* New knn\_text\_to\_vector query parser that encodes query text into a vector (AKA "embedding") via external LLM services.
* New ParallelHttpShardHandlerFactory for reducing distributed-search latency in collections with many shards. This is not used by default.
* Cluster properties can now be listed or read individually using new v2 APIs ("GET /api/cluster/properties" and "GET /api/cluster/properties/propName")
* SolrJ CloudSolrClient now performs reasonably when configured with Solr URLs, which is increasingly going to be preferred over ZK URLs. Some big performance improvements occurred this release.
* Shard splits now support indexes with nested documents.
* `"<lib\>"` tags in solrconfig.xml are now quietly ignored by default unless explicitly enabled with the `SOLR_CONFIG_LIB_ENABLED=true` environment variable (or corresponding sysprop)
* multiThreaded=true no longer risks rejected exceptions under load. But you may need to increase the thread pool to more fully utilize a machine than previously.

Please refer to the Upgrade Notes in the Solr Ref Guide for information on upgrading from previous Solr versions:

## 25 October 2024, Solr 8 reaches End-Of-Life [Â¶](#solr-8-reaches-end-of-life "Permanent link")

With Lucene 10 having been released, and therefore Lucene 8 reaching EOL, the Apache Lucene and Solr PMCs are no longer able to provide new releases for Solr 8.
Solr 8.11.4 will be the last release of Solr 8.

Users are strongly recommended to upgrade to Solr 9, and prepare for the soon-to-be-released Solr 10.

## 14 October 2024, CVE-2024-45216: Apache Solr: Authentication bypass possible using a fake URL Path ending [Â¶](#cve-2024-45216-apache-solr-authentication-bypass-possible-using-a-fake-url-path-ending "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Critical

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 5.3.0 before 8.11.4
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0

**Description:**

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr.

Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.
A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path.
This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.

CVE - [CVE-2024-45216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45216)

## 14 October 2024, CVE-2024-45217: Apache Solr: ConfigSets created during a backup restore command are trusted implicitly [Â¶](#cve-2024-45217-apache-solr-configsets-created-during-a-backup-restore-command-are-trusted-implicitly "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.6.0 before 8.11.4
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.7.0

**Description:**

Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.

New ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command, which copy a configSet from the backup and give it a new name, are created without setting the "trusted" metadata.
ConfigSets that do not contain the flag are trusted implicitly if the metadata is missing, therefore this leads to "trusted" ConfigSets that may not have been created with an Authenticated request.
"trusted" ConfigSets are able to load custom code into classloaders, therefore the flag is supposed to only be set when the request that uploads the ConfigSet is Authenticated & Authorized.

**Mitigation:**

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.

Users are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise.

## 12 April 2024, CVE-2024-31391: Solr-Operator liveness and readiness probes may leak basic auth credentials [Â¶](#cve-2024-31391-solr-operator-liveness-and-readiness-probes-may-leak-basic-auth-credentials "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

Solr Operator 0.3.0 to 0.8.0

**Description:**
Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

The Solr sked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the "solr" and "admin" accounts for use by end-users, and a "k8s-oper" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes "event" containing the username and password of the "k8s-oper" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

**Mitigation:**
Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests. Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`.

Solr is highly scalable, providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 9.5.0 is available for immediate download at:

<https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>

### Solr 9.5.0 Release Highlights:

* Solr now supports "node-level" Memory and CPU circuit breakers, that serve as a default inherited by all cores on that node.
* Collection and Replica Properties may now be used as property substitution variables in configuration files (e.g. solrconfig.xml).
* Solr now auto-reloads updated keystore and truststore files when TLS is enabled.
* Tracing support has received a number of quality-of-life improvements, including improved tracking of distributed collection commands and increased coverage for internal requests made with the Apache and Jetty HTTP clients.
* Solr now offers the `<clusterSingleton>` solr.xml tag as a means of configuring node-level plugins in an "immutable infrastructure"-friendly way. This offers an alternative to using the `/cluster/plugins` API for managing plugins in "live" clusters.
* Starting with 9.5.0, Solr releases now produce an OpenAPI specification covering many of their v2 APIs. Consumers may use this spec with an array of OpenAPI-compatible tooling to generate documentation, clients in various programming languages, etc. See https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi for more details.

## 8 February 2024, CVE-2023-50291: Apache Solr can leak certain passwords due to System Property redaction logic inconsistencies [Â¶](#cve-2023-50291-apache-solr-can-leak-certain-passwords-due-to-system-property-redaction-logic-inconsistencies "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0

**Description:**

Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:

`-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=".*(password|secret|basicauth).*"`

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later, which has consistent systemProperty redaction logic.

## 8 February 2024, CVE-2023-50292: Apache Solr Schema Designer blindly "trusts" all configsets, possibly leading to RCE by unauthenticated users [Â¶](#cve-2023-50292-apache-solr-schema-designer-blindly-trusts-all-configsets-possibly-leading-to-rce-by-unauthenticated-users "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.3.0

**Description:**

Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.

The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3, 9.3.0 or later.

## 8 February 2024, CVE-2023-50298: Apache Solr can expose ZooKeeper credentials via Streaming Expressions [Â¶](#cve-2023-50298-apache-solr-can-expose-zookeeper-credentials-via-streaming-expressions "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Low

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.4.1

**Description:**

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter.
When original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost" the user provides.
An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,
then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".
Streaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.

## 8 February 2024, CVE-2023-50386: Apache Solr: Backup/Restore APIs allow for deployment of executables in malicious ConfigSets [Â¶](#cve-2023-50386-apache-solr-backuprestore-apis-allow-for-deployment-of-executables-in-malicious-configsets "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

* Apache Solr 6.0.0 through 8.11.2
* Apache Solr 9.0.0 before 9.4.1

**Description:**

Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.

When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
In these versions, the following protections have been added:

* Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.
* The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.

## 12 January 2024, CVE-2023-50290: Apache Solr allows read access to host environment variables [Â¶](#cve-2023-50290-apache-solr-allows-read-access-to-host-environment-variables "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Important

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 9.0 to 9.2.1

**Description:**

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.
The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance.
Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties.
Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-process.

The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission.

**Mitigation:**

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published via the Metrics API.

## 20 November 2022, Apache Solr is vulnerable to CVE-2022-39135 via /sql handler [Â¶](#apache-solr-is-vulnerable-to-cve-2022-39135-via-sql-handler "Permanent link")

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 6.5 to 8.11.2
Solr 9.0

**Description:**

Apache Calcite has a vulnerability, CVE-2022-39135, that is exploitable in Apache Solr in SolrCloud mode. If an untrusted user can supply SQL queries to Solrâs â/sqlâ handler (even indirectly via proxies / other apps), then the user could perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This might have been exposed by some deployers of Solr in order for internal analysts to use JDBC based tooling, but would have unlikely been granted to wider audiences.

**Impact:**

An XXE attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery (SSRF), port scanning from the Solr node, and other system impacts.

**Mitigation:**

Most Solr installations donât make use of the SQL functionality. For such users, the standard Solr security advice of using a firewall should be adequate. Nonetheless, the functionality can be disabled. As of Solr 9, it has been modularized and thus became opt-in, so nothing is needed for Solr 9 users that donât use it. Users *not* using SolrCloud canât use the functionality at all. For other users that wish to disable it, you must register a request handler that masks the underlying functionality in solrconfig.xml like so:

```
  <requestHandler name="/sql" class="solr.NotFoundRequestHandler"/>

```

Users needing this SQL functionality are forced to upgrade to Solr 9.1. If Solr 8.11.3 is released, then it will be an option as well. Simply replacing Calcite and other JAR files may mostly work but could fail depending on the particulars of the query. Users interested in this or in patching their own versions of Solr should examine SOLR-16421 for a source patch.

## 21 October 2022, Java 17 bug affecting Solr [Â¶](#java-17-bug-affecting-solr "Permanent link")

Several users running Solr in production on OpenJDK 17 have experienced JVM crashes due to a known bug in the JDK. Read more about the bug in [SOLR-16463](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16463).

Known mitigations are to either downgrade to JDK 11 or to start Solr with a Java startup flag that avoids the failure condition. Here is how to manually apply the flag:

Edit your `solr.in.sh` or `solr.in.cmd` file to set the `SOLR_OPTS` environment variable as follows:

*Linux:*

```
SOLR_OPTS=-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put

```

*Windows:*

```
SET SOLR_OPTS=-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put

```

Alternatively, you can inject the same flag with the `-a` argument, e.g:

```
bin/solr -a "-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.BoundedLocalCache::put"

```

If you run Solr 9 with the official Docker image, we have already pushed an updated Docker image to Docker Hub that will inject the flag for you.
Just pull the image again to get it.
The Docker image uses the `-a` option to set this java flag when running Solr, so if you are using the
`-a` option you will need to provide the JVM flag mentioned above in addition to the other flags you are setting.

## 20 October 2022, Solr 8 Docker image changes to Eclipse Temurin JDK [Â¶](#solr-8-docker-image-changes-to-eclipse-temurin-jdk "Permanent link")

The official docker image for Solr 8.11 has been running on [Oracle OpenJDK 11 JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk). However, due to Oracle's new release policies, they now no longer provide support for JDK11. Since Solr 8.11 is still being supported by the Apache Solr project, we needed to switch to another OpenJDK vendor with JDK11 support. We chose [Eclipse Temurin](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) from the Adoptium project. This is the same vendor as we use for our Solr 9 image, and their [JDK11 support lasts until October 2024](https://adoptium.net/support/).

Users should be aware that on your next `docker pull solr:8.11.2` you will be upgraded. For most users there will be no issues, as it is mainly a new distribution of the same upstream OpenJDK version. However, if you use our image as base image and rely on specific tools to be present, you may need to adapt. While `openjdk:11-jre` uses `Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)`, the `eclipse-temurin:11-jre-focal` image uses `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)`.

Furthermore, there is now no difference between the `solr:11-jre` and `solr:11-jre-slim` images, because our new vendor only offers one variant which is fairly slim already.

## 20 October 2022, Solr Docker images now pin the Linux release [Â¶](#solr-docker-images-now-pin-the-linux-release "Permanent link")

Solr 9 was released on May 12th, using the `eclipse-temurin:17-jre` base image. Thus, we are pinned to Java 17 and Solr's
Docker image will thus always use an updated Java 17 version. If you pull the docker image from time to time that is.

However, the base image tag `17-jre` did not give us pinning to a specific Ubuntu Linux major release.
At the time of [Solr 9 release](http://localhost:8000/news.html#apache-solrtm-900-available) on May 12th
it would pull Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa), but at the end of May, it was [auto upgraded](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/commit/6d689db4846a3eb4c2ebd0e5d06139c650ef3bbb) to the brand new Ubuntu
22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish). This was not our desire, and we have learnt that due to this, our image is no longer compatible
with Docker client versions before 20.10.16. Having a "floating" linux release like this can also break the image in
other subtle ways, as well as breaking downstream images using us as a base image.

We therefore decided to start pinning not only Java release, but also Linux release in our official Docker images.
This means that Solr 9.0 is once again based on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, i.e. a downgrade.

Note that our images will still receive important Linux bug fixes from time to time, but you won't get them unless you
re-pull the image. When we upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 in the future, it will be a deliberate decision and not by accident.

## 18 December 2021, CVE-2021-44548: Apache Solr information disclosure vulnerability through DataImportHandler [Â¶](#cve-2021-44548-apache-solr-information-disclosure-vulnerability-through-dataimporthandler "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Moderate

**Versions Affected:**

All versions prior to 8.11.1. Affected platforms: Windows.

**Description:**

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in:

* The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),
* In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects Windows.

**Mitigation:**

Upgrade to Solr 8.11.1, and/or ensure only trusted clients can make requests to Solr's DataImport handler.

**Credit:**

Apache Solr would like to thank LaiHan of Nsfocus security team for reporting the issue

## 10 December 2021, Apache Solr affected by Apache Log4J CVE-2021-44228 [Â¶](#apache-solr-affected-by-apache-log4j-cve-2021-44228 "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
Critical

**Versions Affected:**
7.4.0 to 7.7.3, 8.0.0 to 8.11.0

**Description:**
Apache Solr releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE. For full impact and additional detail consult the Log4J security page.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender, see <https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126> for discussion.

Solr's Prometheus Exporter uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

Solr is *not* vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**. A listing of these and other CVEs with some justifications are listed in Solr's wiki: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SOLR/SolrSecurity#SolrSecurity-SolrandVulnerabilityScanningTools>

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability for Solr servers:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.11.1` or greater (when available), which will include an updated version (`>= 2.16.0`) of the Log4J dependency.
* If you are using Solr's official docker image, it has already been mitigated in all versions listed as supported on Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/_/solr>. You may need to re-pull the image.
* Manually update the version of Log4J on your runtime classpath and restart your Solr application.
* (Linux/MacOS) Edit your `solr.in.sh` file to include:
  `SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"`
* (Windows) Edit your `solr.in.cmd` file to include:
  `set SOLR_OPTS=%SOLR_OPTS% -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
* Follow any of the other mitgations listed at <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html>

The Log4J security page refers to setting `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` as a "discredited" mitigation. In reality, it depends.
We've looked at the root cause and audited the code paths that lead to the vulnerability, and we feel confident in this mitigation being sufficient for Solr.
See <https://lists.apache.org/thread/kgh63sncrsm2bls884pg87mnt8vqztmz> for discussion.

## 12 April 2021, CVE-2021-27905: SSRF vulnerability with the Replication handler [Â¶](#cve-2021-27905-ssrf-vulnerability-with-the-replication-handler "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1

**Description:**
The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a Solr core) has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core.
To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15217](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15217)
* Ensure that any access to the replication handler is purely internal to Solr. Typically, it's only accessed externally for diagnostic/informational purposes.

## 12 April 2021, CVE-2021-29262: Misapplied Zookeeper ACLs can result in leakage of configured authentication and authorization settings [Â¶](#cve-2021-29262-misapplied-zookeeper-acls-can-result-in-leakage-of-configured-authentication-and-authorization-settings "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1

**Description:**
When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it to be readable.
Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Manually set appropriate ACLs on /security.json znode.
* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15249](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15249)
* Ensure that any access to zookeeper is only by trusted application.

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.8.1

**Description:**
When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to `Solr 8.8.2` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-15233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15233)
* Use a different authentication plugin, such as the KerberosPlugin or HadoopAuthPlugin

## 17 February 2021, Apache Solr becomes an Apache TLP [Â¶](#apache-solr-becomes-an-apache-tlp "Permanent link")

The Apache Software Foundation's board today established Solr as a Top Level Project (TLP).
Solr has been a Lucene sub-project since its incubation in 2006, governed by the Lucene PMC,
and has since the 3.1 release also shared source code repository with Lucene.

### What's the background?

The change was proposed by members of the Lucene PMC, and a vote in June 2020 decided
that Solr would be a separate TLP. Later, the Lucene PMC decided that the Solr project
would be bootstrapped with the same set of committers and PMC members as the "mother" Lucene project.

### How does this affect users?

The Solr software will not change at all as a result of this, but users will see these changes:

1. Solr gets a new website at [solr.apache.org](http://solr.apache.org/)
2. Solr gets a new download location in the mirrors
3. The email address of the users mailing-list will change, but subscribers will be moved automatically

### How does this affect developers?

Developers will have to do a number of things to adapt to the change

1. Subscribe to the new mailing lists. See [Mailing Lists & Chat](/community.html#mailing-lists-chat) for instructions
2. Start using [the new git location](/community.html#version-control) by cloning or defining a new git remote
3. Realize that lucene will be a build dependency of Solr on the main branch (once the code migration is done)
4. Backported bug fixes for Solr 8.8 must be submitted to the Lucene git, for a joint bugfix release

**NOTE:** Some things may be in flux during the migration work.

## 12 October 2020, CVE-2020-13957: The checks added to unauthenticated configset uploads in Apache Solr can be circumvented [Â¶](#cve-2020-13957-the-checks-added-to-unauthenticated-configset-uploads-in-apache-solr-can-be-circumvented "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
High

**Versions Affected:**
6.6.0 to 6.6.6
7.0.0 to 7.7.3
8.0.0 to 8.6.2

**Description:**
Solr prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.

**Mitigation:**
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Disable UPLOAD command in ConfigSets API if not used by setting the system property: `configset.upload.enabled` to `false` ([see docs](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/configsets-api.html))
* Use Authentication/Authorization and make sure unknown requests aren't allowed ([see docs](https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_6/authentication-and-authorization-plugins.html))
* Upgrade to `Solr 8.6.3` or greater.
* If upgrading is not an option, consider applying the patch in [SOLR-14663](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-14663)
* No Solr API, including the Admin UI, is designed to be exposed to non-trusted parties. Tune your firewall so that only trusted computers and people are allowed access

## 14 August 2020, CVE-2020-13941: Apache Solr information disclosure vulnerability [Â¶](#cve-2020-13941-apache-solr-information-disclosure-vulnerability "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
Medium

**Versions Affected:**

Before Solr 8.6. Some risks are specific to Windows.

**Description:**
Reported in SOLR-14515 (private) and fixed in SOLR-14561 (public), released in Solr version 8.6.0.
The Replication handler (https://solr.apache.org/guide/8\_6/index-replication.html#http-api-commands-for-the-replicationhandler) allows commands backup, restore and deleteBackup. Each of these take a location parameter, which was not validated, i.e you could read/write to any location the solr user can access.

On a windows system SMB paths such as \10.0.0.99\share\folder may also be used, leading to:

* The possibility of restoring another SolrCore from a server on the network (or mounted remote file system) may lead to:
  + Exposing search index data that the attacker should otherwise not have access to
  + Replacing the index data entirely by loading it from a remote file system that the attacker controls
* Launching SMB attacks which may result in:
  + The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes),
  + In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to Solr 8.6, and/or ensure only trusted clients can make requests of Solr's replication handler.

## 30 December 2019, CVE-2019-17558: Apache Solr RCE through VelocityResponseWriter [Â¶](#cve-2019-17558-apache-solr-rce-through-velocityresponsewriter "Permanent link")

**Severity:** High

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**
5.0.0 to 8.3.1

**Description:**

The affected versions are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution through the
VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be provided through
Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter.
A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious,
templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can
be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a
response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response
writer requires configuration API access.

Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the
configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has
been uploaded by an authenticated user).

**Mitigation:**

Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic
communicates with Solr, especially to the configuration APIs.

## 18 November 2019, CVE-2019-12409: Apache Solr RCE vulnerability due to bad config default [Â¶](#cve-2019-12409-apache-solr-rce-vulnerability-due-to-bad-config-default "Permanent link")

**Severity:**
High

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 for Linux

**Description:**

The 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 releases of Apache Solr contain an
insecure setting for the ENABLE\_REMOTE\_JMX\_OPTS configuration option
in the default solr.in.sh configuration file shipping with Solr.

Windows users are not affected.

If you use the default solr.in.sh file from the affected releases, then
JMX monitoring will be enabled and exposed on RMI\_PORT (default=18983),
without any authentication. If this port is opened for inbound traffic
in your firewall, then anyone with network access to your Solr nodes
will be able to access JMX, which may in turn allow them to upload
malicious code for execution on the Solr server.

The vulnerability is already public [1] and mitigation steps were
announced on project mailing lists and news page [3] on August 14th,
without mentioning RCE at that time.

**Mitigation:**

Make sure your effective solr.in.sh file has ENABLE\_REMOTE\_JMX\_OPTS set
to 'false' on every Solr node and then restart Solr. Note that the
effective solr.in.sh file may reside in /etc/defaults/ or another
location depending on the install. You can then validate that the
'com.sun.management.jmxremote\*' family of properties are not listed in
the "Java Properties" section of the Solr Admin UI, or configured in a
secure way.

There is no need to upgrade or update any code.

Remember to follow the Solr Documentation's advice to never expose Solr
nodes directly in a hostile network environment.

If you are using the default solr.in.sh file from the affected releases, then
JMX monitoring will be enabled and exposed on JMX_PORT (default = 18983),
without any authentication. So if your firewalls allows inbound traffic on
JMX_PORT, then anyone with network access to your Solr nodes will be able to
access monitoring data exposed over JMX.

Mitigation:
Edit solr.in.sh, set ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=false and restart Solr.
Alternatively wait for the future 8.3.0 release and upgrade.

## 31 July 2019, CVE-2019-0193: Apache Solr, Remote Code Execution via DataImportHandler [Â¶](#cve-2019-0193-apache-solr-remote-code-execution-via-dataimporthandler "Permanent link")

**Severity:** High

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* 5.0.0 to 5.5.5
* 6.0.0 to 6.6.5

**Description:**

The DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from
databases and other sources, has a feature in which the whole DIH
configuration can come from a request's "dataConfig" parameter. The debug
mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging /
development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this
parameter is a security risk. Starting with version 8.2.0 of Solr, use of
this parameter requires setting the Java System property
`enable.dih.dataConfigParam` to true.

**Mitigation:**

* Upgrade to 8.2.0 or later, which is secure by default.
* or, edit solrconfig.xml to configure all DataImportHandler usages with an "invariants" section listing the "dataConfig" parameter set to am empty string.
* Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic communicates with Solr, especially to the DIH request handler. This is a best practice to all of Solr.

## 14 March 2019, Apache Solrâ¢ 8.0.0 available [Â¶](#apache-solrtm-800-available "Permanent link")

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 8.0.0

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault
tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features of

Solr 8.0.0 is available for immediate download at:
<https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>

Please read CHANGES.txt for a full list of new features and changes:

<https://solr.apache.org/8_0_0/changes/Changes.html>

### Solr 8.0.0 Release Highlights

* Solr now uses HTTP/2 for inter-node communication to attain greater efficiency.
  Details: Solr is switching from Apache HttpClient to Jetty Client for adding HTTP/2 support.
  Most frequent inter-communication between nodes like indexing and query are now sent in HTTP/2.
  HTTP/1.1 practically allows only one outstanding request per TCP connection this means that for sending multiple requests at the same time multiple TCP connections must be established.
  This leads to waste of resources on both-sides and long GC-pause.
  Solr 8 with HTTP/2 support overcomes that problem by allowing multiple requests can be sent in parallel using a same TCP connection.
* Nested documents (AKA child documents or block join) is significantly improved.
  Most improvements come from storing and leveraging more information about the relationships in the index, like the named relationship between a child and its parent.
  This information is used by the [child] doc transformer to return children in nested form instead of flat.
  There is plenty more that can be done with this in the future.
  Another key improvement is that nested documents can be deleted or replaced in a natural way without orphaning child documents; although care is still needed with delete-by-query.

Being a major release, Solr 8 removes many deprecated APIs, changes various parameter defaults and behavior. Some changes may require a re-index of your content.
You are thus encouraged to thoroughly read the "Upgrade Notes" at:

<https://solr.apache.org/8_0_0/changes/Changes.html>

Solr 8.0 also includes many other new features as well as numerous optimizations and bugfixes of the corresponding Apache Lucene release:

## 6 March 2019, CVE-2019-0192: Deserialization of untrusted data via jmx.serviceUrl in Apache Solr [Â¶](#cve-2019-0192-deserialization-of-untrusted-data-via-jmxserviceurl-in-apache-solr "Permanent link")

**Severity:** High

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* 5.0.0 to 5.5.5
* 6.0.0 to 6.6.5

**Description:**

ConfigAPI allows to configure Solr's JMX server via an HTTP POST request.
By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage
of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the
Solr side.

**Mitigation:**

Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to Apache Solr 7.0 or later.
* Disable the ConfigAPI if not in use, by running Solr with the system property âdisable.configEdit=trueâ
* If upgrading or disabling the Config API are not viable options, apply patch in [1] and re-compile Solr.
* Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.

### Solr 7.7.1 Release Highlights:

* Bugfix for ClassCastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence (a
  regression in release 7.7.0).
* Bugfix: Autoscaling based replica placement was broken out of the box. Solr 7.6 enabled autoscaling based replica
  placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
  same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
  this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
  Solr 7.5.

## 12 February 2019, CVE-2017-3164: SSRF issue in Apache Solr [Â¶](#cve-2017-3164-ssrf-issue-in-apache-solr "Permanent link")

**Severity:** High

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**
Apache Solr versions from 1.3 to 7.6.0

**Description:**

The "shards" parameter does not have a corresponding whitelist mechanism,
so it can request any URL.

**Mitigation:**

Upgrade to Apache Solr 7.7.0 or later.
Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is
allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.

## 8 April 2018, CVE-2018-1308: XXE attack through Apache Solr's DIH's dataConfig request parameter [Â¶](#cve-2018-1308-xxe-attack-through-apache-solrs-dihs-dataconfig-request-parameter "Permanent link")

CVE-2018-1308: XXE attack through Apache Solr's DIH's dataConfig request parameter

**Severity:** Major

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* Solr 1.2 to 6.6.2
* Solr 7.0.0 to 7.2.1

**Description:**

The details of this vulnerability were reported to the Apache Security mailing list.

This vulnerability relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in the
`&dataConfig=<inlinexml>` parameter of Solr's DataImportHandler. It can be
used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local
files from the Solr server or the internal network. See [1] for more details.

**Mitigation:**

Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.3 or Solr 7.3.0 releases both
of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps
are required. Those releases disable external entities in anonymous XML files
passed through this request parameter.

If users are unable to upgrade to Solr 6.6.3 or Solr 7.3.0 then they are
advised to disable data import handler in their solrconfig.xml file and
restart their Solr instances. Alternatively, if Solr instances are only used
locally without access to public internet, the vulnerability cannot be used
directly, so it may not be required to update, and instead reverse proxies or
Solr client applications should be guarded to not allow end users to inject
`dataConfig` request parameters. Please refer to [2] on how to correctly
secure Solr servers.

## 26 October 2017, CVE-2016-6809: Java code execution for serialized objects embedded in MATLAB files parsed by Apache Solr using Tika [Â¶](#cve-2016-6809-java-code-execution-for-serialized-objects-embedded-in-matlab-files-parsed-by-apache-solr-using-tika "Permanent link")

**Severity:** Important

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* Solr 5.0.0 to 5.5.4
* Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.1
* Solr 7.0.0 to 7.0.1

**Description:**

Apache Solr uses Apache Tika for parsing binary file types such as
doc, xls, pdf etc. Apache Tika wraps the jmatio parser
(https://github.com/gradusnikov/jmatio) to handle MATLAB files. The
parser uses native deserialization on serialized Java objects embedded
in MATLAB files. A malicious user could inject arbitrary code into a
MATLAB file that would be executed when the object is deserialized.

This vulnerability was originally described at
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod\_mbox/tika-user/201611.mbox/%3C2125912914.1308916.1478787314903%40mail.yahoo.com%3E

**Mitigation:**

Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 5.5.5 or Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0
releases which have fixed this vulnerability.

Solr 5.5.5 upgrades the jmatio parser to v1.2 and disables the Java
deserialisation support to protect against this vulnerability.

Solr 6.6.2 and Solr 7.1.0 have upgraded the bundled Tika to v1.16.

Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required.

## 18 October 2017, Several critical vulnerabilities discovered in Apache Solr (XXE & RCE) [Â¶](#several-critical-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-apache-solr-xxe-rce "Permanent link")

**Severity:**

Critical

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* Solr 5.5.0 to 5.5.4
* Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.1
* Solr 7.0.0 to 7.0.1

**Description:**

The details of this vulnerability were reported on public mailing
lists. See https://s.apache.org/FJDl

The first vulnerability relates to XML external entity expansion in
the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for any query
request with parameters deftype=xmlparser. This can be exploited to
upload malicious data to the /upload request handler. It can also be
used as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local
files from the solr server.

The second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the
RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.

At the time of the above report, this was a 0-day vulnerability with a
working exploit affecting the versions of Solr mentioned in the
previous section. However, mitigation steps were announced to protect
Solr users the same day. See
https://solr.apache.org/news.html#12-october-2017-please-secure-your-apache-solr-servers-since-a-zero-day-exploit-has-been-reported-on-a-public-mailing-list

**Mitigation:**

Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0
releases both of which address the two vulnerabilities. Once upgrade is
complete, no other steps are required.

If users are unable to upgrade to Solr 6.6.2 or Solr 7.1.0 then they
are advised to restart their Solr instances with the system parameter
`-Ddisable.configEdit=true`. This will disallow any changes to be made
to your configurations via the Config API. This is a key factor in
this vulnerability, since it allows GET requests to add the
RunExecutableListener to your config. Users are also advised to re-map
the XML Query Parser to another parser to mitigate the XXE
vulnerability. For example, adding the following to the solrconfig.xml
file re-maps the xmlparser to the edismax parser:
`<queryParser name="xmlparser" class="solr.ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin"/>`

Please read CHANGES.txt for a full list of new features and changes:

<https://solr.apache.org/7_1_0/changes/Changes.html>

### Highlights for this Solr release include:

* Critical Security Update: Fix for CVE-2017-12629 which is a working 0-day exploit reported on the [public mailing list](https://s.apache.org/FJDl).
* Auto-scaling: Solr can now move replicas automatically when a new node is added or an existing node is removed using the auto scaling policy framework introduced in 7.0
* Auto-scaling: The 'autoAddReplicas' feature which was limited to shared file systems is now available for all file systems. It has been ported to use the new autoscaling framework internally.
* Auto-scaling: New set-trigger, remove-trigger, set-listener, remove-listener, suspend-trigger, resume-trigger APIs
* Auto-scaling: New /autoscaling/history API to show past autoscaling actions and cluster events
* New JSON based Query DSL for Solr that extends JSON Request API to also support all query parsers and their nested parameters
* JSON Facet API: min/max aggregations are now supported on single-valued date fields
* Lucene's Geo3D (surface of sphere & ellipsoid) is now supported on spatial RPT fields by setting spatialContextFactory="Geo3D". Furthermore, this is the first time Solr has out of the box support for polygons
* Expanded support for statistical stream evaluators such as various distributions, rank correlations, distances and more.
* Multiple other optimizations and bug fixes

You are encouraged to thoroughly read the "Upgrade Notes" at <https://solr.apache.org/7_1_0/changes/Changes.html> or in the CHANGES.txt file accompanying the release.

Solr 7.1 also includes many other new features as well as numerous optimizations and bugfixes of the corresponding Apache Lucene release.

## 12 October 2017, Please secure your Apache Solr servers since a zero-day exploit has been reported on a public mailing list [Â¶](#solr-security-please-secure-your-apache-solr-servers-since-a-zero-day-exploit-has-been-reported-on-a-public-mailing-list "Permanent link")

Please secure your Solr servers since a zero-day exploit has been
reported on a [public mailing list](https://s.apache.org/FJDl).
This has been assigned a public CVE (CVE-2017-12629) which we
will reference in future communication about resolution and mitigation
steps.

Here is what we're recommending and what we're doing now:

* Until fixes are available, all Solr users are advised to restart their
  Solr instances with the system property `-Ddisable.configEdit=true`.
  This will disallow any changes to be made to configurations via the
  Config API. This is a key factor in this vulnerability, since it allows
  GET requests to add the RunExecutableListener to the config. This is
  sufficient to protect you from this type of attack, but means you cannot
  use the edit capabilities of the Config API until the other fixes
  described below are in place. Users are also advised to remap
  the XML Query Parser to another parser to mitigate the XXE
  vulnerability. For example, adding the following to the solrconfig.xml
  file maps the `xmlparser` to the `edismax` parser:
  `<queryParser name="xmlparser" class="solr.ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin"/>`.
* A new release of Lucene/Solr was in the vote phase, but we have now
  pulled it back to be able to address these issues in the upcoming 7.1
  release. We will also determine mitigation steps for users on earlier
  versions, which may include a 6.6.2 release for users still on 6.x.
* The RunExecutableListener will be removed in 7.1. It was previously
  used by Solr for index replication but has been replaced and is no
  longer needed.
* The XML Parser will be fixed and the fixes will be included in the 7.1
  release.
* The 7.1 release was already slated to include a change to disable the
  `stream.body` parameter by default, which will further help protect
  systems.

## 6 October 2017, Apache Solrâ¢ 7.0.1 available [Â¶](#apache-solrtm-701-available "Permanent link")

## 20 September 2017, Apache Solrâ¢ 7.0.0 available [Â¶](#apache-solrtm-700-available "Permanent link")

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 7.0.0

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 7.0.0 is available for immediate download at:
<https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>

### Highlights for this Solr release include:

* Replica Types - Solr 7 supports different replica types, which handle updates differently. In addition to pure NRT operation where all replicas build an index and keep a replication log, you can now also add so called PULL replicas, achieving the read-speed optimized benefits of a master/slave setup while at the same time keeping index redundancy.
* Auto-scaling. Solr can now allocate new replicas to nodes using a new auto scaling policy framework. This framework will in future releases enable Solr to move shards around based on load, disk etc.
* Indented JSON is now the default response format for all APIs, pass wt=xml and/or indent=off to use the previous unindented XML format.
* The JSON Facet API now supports two-phase facet refinement to ensure accurate counts and statistics for facet buckets returned in distributed mode.
* Streaming Expressions adds a new statistical programming syntax for the statistical analysis of sql queries, random samples, time series and graph result sets.
* Analytics Component version 2.0, which now supports distributed collections, expressions over multivalued fields, a new JSON request language, and more.
* The new v2 API, exposed at /api/ and also supported via SolrJ, is now the preferred API, but /solr/ continues to work.
* A new '\_default' configset is used if no config is specified at collection creation. The data-driven functionality of this configset indexes strings as analyzed text while at the same time copying to a '\*\_str' field suitable for faceting.
* Solr 7 is tested with and verified to support Java 9.

See the [Solr CHANGES.txt](/docs/7_0_0/changes/Changes.html) files included with the release for a full list of details.

## 18 September 2017, CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality\*\* [Â¶](#cve-2017-9803-security-vulnerability-in-kerberos-delegation-token-functionality "Permanent link")

**CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality**

**Severity**: Important

**Vendor**:

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected**:

Solr 6.2.0 to 6.6.0

**Description**:

Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application.
There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider),

Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster.

The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.

**Mitigation**:

6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.1

**Credit**:

This issue was discovered by Hrishikesh Gadre of Cloudera Inc.

## 7 September 2017, Apache Solrâ¢ 6.6.1 available [Â¶](#apache-solrtm-661-available "Permanent link")

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.6.1

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 6.6.1 is available for immediate download at:
<https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>

This release includes 15 bug fixes since the 6.6.0 release. Some of the major fixes are:

* Standalone Solr loads UNLOADed core on request
* ParallelStream should set the StreamContext when constructing SolrStreams
* CloudSolrStream.toExpression incorrectly handles fq clauses
* CoreContainer.load needs to send lazily loaded core descriptors to the proper list rather than send them all to the transient lists
* Creating a core should write a core.properties file first and clean up on failure
* Clean up a few details left over from pluggable transient core and untangling
* Provide a way to know when Core Discovery is finished and when all async cores are done loading
* CDCR bootstrapping can get into an infinite loop when a core is reloaded
* SolrJmxReporter is broken on core reload. This resulted in some or most metrics not being reported via JMX after core reloads, depending on timing
* Creating a core.properties fails if the parent of core.properties is a symlinked directory
* StreamHandler should allow connections to be closed early
* Certain admin UI pages would not load up correctly with kerberos enabled
* Fix DOWNNODE -> queue-work znode explosion in ZooKeeper
* Upgrade to Hadoop 2.7.4 to fix incompatibility with Java 9
* Fix bin/solr.cmd so it can run properly on Java 9

Furthermore, this release includes Apache Lucene 6.6.1 which includes 2 bug fixes since the 6.6.0 release.

## 7 July 2017, CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr\*\* [Â¶](#cve-2017-7660-security-vulnerability-in-secure-inter-node-communication-in-apache-solr "Permanent link")

**CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr**

**Severity**: Important

**Vendor**:

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected**:

* Solr 5.3 to 5.5.4
* Solr 6.0 to 6.5.1

**Description:**

Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted
node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a
malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that
the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have
enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin
or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which
does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or
"HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this
attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those
who use Kerberos are not affected.

**Mitigation**:

* 6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.0 or higher
* 5.x users should obtain the latest source from git and apply this patch:
  <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr/commit/2f5ecbcf>

## 15 February 2017, CVE-2017-3163: Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack\*\* [Â¶](#cve-2017-3163-apache-solr-replicationhandler-path-traversal-attack "Permanent link")

**CVE-2017-3163: Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack**

**Severity:** Moderate

**Vendor:**

The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

Solr 1.4 to 6.4.0

**Description:**

When using the Index Replication feature, Solr nodes can pull index files from
a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However,
Solr did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server
process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules
and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users
would gain direct HTTP access.

**Mitigation:**

* 6.x users should upgrade to 6.4.1
* 5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.4
* 4.x, 3.x and 1.4 users should upgrade to a supported version of Solr or setup proper firewalling, or disable the ReplicationHandler if not in use.

**Credit:**

This issue was discovered by ï»¿Hrishikesh Gadre of Cloudera Inc.

Streaming:

* Addition of a HavingStream to Streaming API and Streaming Expressions
* Addition of a priority Streaming Expression
* Streaming expressions now support collection aliases

Machine Learning:

* Configurable Learning-To-Rank (LTR) support: upload feature definitions, extract feature values, upload your own machine learnt models and use them to rerank search results.

Faceting:

* Added "param" query type to facet domain filter specification to obtain filters via query parameters
* Any facet command can be filtered using a new parameter filter. Example: { type:terms, field:category, filter:"user:yonik" }

Scripts / Command line:

* A new command-line tool to manage the snapshots functionality
* bin/solr and bin/solr.cmd now use mkroot command

SolrCloud / SolrJ

* LukeResponse now supports dynamic fields
* Solrj client now supports hierarchical clusters and other topics marker
* Collection backup/restore are extensible.

Security:

* Support Secure Impersonation / Proxy User for Solr authentication
* Key Store type can be specified in solr.in.sh file for SSL
* New generic authentication plugins: 'HadoopAuthPlugin' and 'ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin' that delegate all functionality to Hadoop authentication framework

Query / QueryParser / Highlighting:

* A new highlighter: The Unified Highlighter. Try it via `hl.method=unified`; many popular highlighting parameters / features are supported. It's the highest performing highlighter, especially for large documents. Highlighting phrase queries and exotic queries are supported equally as well as the Original Highlighter (aka the default/standard one). Please use this new highlighter and report issues since it will likely become the default one day.
* Leading wildcard in complexphrase query parser are now accepted and optimized with the `ReversedWildcardFilterFactory` when it's provided

Metrics:

* Use metrics-jvm library to instrument jvm internals such as GC, memory usage and others.
* A lot of metrics have been added to the collection: index merges, index store I/Os, query, update, core admin, core load thread pools, shard replication, tlog replay and replicas
* A new /admin/metrics API to return all metrics collected by Solr via API.

Misc changes:

* The new config parameter 'maxRamMB'can now limit the memory consumed by the FastLRUCache
* A new document processor 'SkipExistingDocumentsProcessor' that skips duplicate inserts and ignores updates to missing docs
* FieldCache information fetched via the mbeans handler or seen via the UI now displays the total size used.
* A new config flag 'enable' allows to enable/disable any cache

Please note, this release cannot be built from source with Java 8 update 121,
use an earlier version instead! This is caused by a bug introduced into the
Javadocs tool shipped with that update. The workaround was too late for this
Lucene release. Of course, you can use the binary artifacts.

Faceting:

* facet.method=enum can bypass exact counts calculation with facet.exists=true, it just returns 1 for terms which exists in result docset
* Add "overrequest" parameter to JSON Facet API to control amount of overrequest on a distributed terms facet

Logging:

* You can now set Solr's log level through environment variable SOLR\_LOG\_LEVEL
* GC logs are rotated by JVM to a max of 9 files, and backed up via bin/solr scripts
* Solr's logging verbosity at the INFO level has been greatly reduced by moving much logging to DEBUG level
* The solr-8983-console.log file now only logs STDOUT and STDERR output, not all log4j logs as before
* Solr's main log file, solr.log, is now written to SOLR\_LOGS\_DIR without changing log4j.properties

Start scripts:

* Allow 180 seconds for shutdown before killing solr (configurable, old limit 5s) (Unix only)
* Start scripts now exits with informative message if using wrong Java version
* Fixed "bin/solr.cmd zk upconfig" command which was broken on windows
* You can now ask for DEBUG logging simply with '-v' option, and for WARN logging with '-q' option

SolrCloud:

* The DELETEREPLICA API can accept a 'count' parameter and remove "count" number of replicas from each shard if the shard name is not provided
* The config API shows expanded useParams for request handlers inline
* Ability to create/delete/list snapshots at collection level
* The modify collection API now waits for the modified properties to show up in the cluster state before returning
* Many bug fixes related to SolrCloud recovery for data safety and faster recovery times.

Security:

* SolrJ now supports Kerberos delegation tokens
* Pooled SSL connections were not being re-used. This is now fixed.
* Fix for the blockUnknown property which made inter-node communication impossible
* Support SOLR\_AUTHENTICATION\_OPTS and SOLR\_AUTHENTICATION\_CLIENT\_CONFIGURER in windows bin/solr.cmd script
* New parameter -u  in bin/post to pass basicauth credentials

Misc changes:

* Optimizations to lower memory allocations when indexing JSON as well as for replication between solr cloud nodes.
* A new Excel workbook (.xlsx) response writer has been added. Use 'wt=xlsx' request parameter on a query request to enable.

* Deprecated SolrServer and subclasses have been removed, use SolrClient instead.
* The deprecated  configuration in solrconfig.xml has been removed. Users must remove it from solrconfig.xml.
* SolrClient.shutdown() has been removed, use SolrClient.close() instead.
* The deprecated zkCredientialsProvider element in solrcloud section of solr.xml is now removed. Use the correct spelling (zkCredentialsProvider) instead.
* Added support for executing Parallel SQL queries across SolrCloud collections. Includes StreamExpression support and a new JDBC Driver for the SQL Interface.
* New features and capabilities added to the streaming API.
* Added support for SELECT DISTINCT queries to the SQL interface.

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 5.5.0

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)

## 8 February 2016, Apache Lucene/Solr development moves to GIT [Â¶](#apache-lucenesolr-development-moves-to-git "Permanent link")

As of January 23rd 2016, Lucene/Solr source code is hosted in Apache's GIT repository.
This means that the old SVN repository is now stale and should not be used.
For information on working with git, please consult
[the Solr web site](https://solr.apache.org/resources.html#solr-version-control)
and the [wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Git%20commit%20process).

The [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/) remains at
the same location as before, but the contents have changed. We now have
one unified repo preserving the full history of both Lucene and Solr.
If you had a GitHub fork, you will find
that it has changed its "forked from" location, and any Pull Request will go to
that other fork instead of to the Lucene developers. The only known solution is to
delete your existing fork and re-fork from [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/).

If you had active code changes and Pull Requests against our old GitHub mirror,
please see [the wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/HowToContribute#Working_with_GitHub)
for some suggestions on how to proceed.

The PMC is happy to answer any question you may have regarding this change.

See the [CHANGES.txt](/docs/4_10_0/changes/Changes.html)
file included with the release for a full list of details.

Solr 4.10.0 Release Highlights:

* This release upgrades Solr Cell's (contrib/extraction) dependency
  on Apache POI to mitigate
  [2 security vulnerabilities](#18-august-2014-recommendation-to-update-apache-poi-in-apache-solr-480-481-and-490-installations).
* Scripts for starting, stopping, and running Solr examples
* Distributed query support for facet.pivot
* Interval Faceting for Doc Values fields
* New "terms" QParser for efficiently filtering documents by a list of values

## 18 August 2014, Recommendation to update Apache POI in Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, and 4.9.0 installations [Â¶](#solr-news-recommendation-to-update-apache-poi-in-apache-solr-480-481-and-490-installations "Permanent link")

Apache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball.
This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:

### CVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Information disclosure:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...).
Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass
security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction
with an entity reference.

### CVE-2014-3574: XML Entity Expansion (XEE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Denial of service:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components and Apache Xmlbeans to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products
(DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks ("XML bombs"),
which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.

**The Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.**

Solr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the "Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)"
contrib module from the folder "contrib/extraction" of the release tarball.

Users of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it.
Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by
replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have
to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.

### To replace the vulnerable JAR files follow these steps:

* Download the [Apache POI 3.10.1](http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.10.1) binary release.
* Unzip the archive.
* Delete the following files in your "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:

  + poi-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-ooxml-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-scratchpad-3.10-beta2.jar
  + xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar
* Copy the following files from the base folder of the Apache POI distribution to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:

  + poi-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-scratchpad-3.10.1-20140818.jar
* Copy "xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar" from POI's "ooxml-lib/" folder to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder.
* Verify that the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" no longer contains any files with version number "3.10-beta2".
* Verify that the folder contains one xmlbeans JAR file with version 2.6.0.

If you just want to disable extraction of Microsoft Office documents, delete the files above and don't replace them.
"Solr Cell" will automatically detect this and disable Microsoft Office document extraction.

Coming versions of Apache Solr will have the updated libraries bundled.

## 18 August 2014, CVE-2014-3529, CVE-2014-3574: Recommendation to update Apache POI in Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, and 4.9.0 installations [Â¶](#solr-security-security-recommendation-to-update-apache-poi-in-apache-solr-480-481-and-490-installations "Permanent link")

Apache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball.
This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:

### CVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Information disclosure:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...).
Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass
security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction
with an entity reference.

### CVE-2014-3574: XML Entity Expansion (XEE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Denial of service:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components and Apache Xmlbeans to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products
(DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks ("XML bombs"),
which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.

**The Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.**

Solr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the "Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)"
contrib module from the folder "contrib/extraction" of the release tarball.

Users of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it.
Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by
replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have
to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.

### To replace the vulnerable JAR files follow these steps:

* Download the [Apache POI 3.10.1](http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.10.1) binary release.
* Unzip the archive.
* Delete the following files in your "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:

  + poi-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-ooxml-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10-beta2.jar
  + poi-scratchpad-3.10-beta2.jar
  + xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar
* Copy the following files from the base folder of the Apache POI distribution to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:

  + poi-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818.jar
  + poi-scratchpad-3.10.1-20140818.jar
* Copy "xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar" from POI's "ooxml-lib/" folder to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder.
* Verify that the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" no longer contains any files with version number "3.10-beta2".
* Verify that the folder contains one xmlbeans JAR file with version 2.6.0.

If you just want to disable extraction of Microsoft Office documents, delete the files above and don't replace them.
"Solr Cell" will automatically detect this and disable Microsoft Office document extraction.

Coming versions of Apache Solr will have the updated libraries bundled.

## 12 March 2014, Apache Solr 4.8 will require Java 7 [Â¶](#apache-solr-48-will-require-java-7 "Permanent link")

The Apache Solr committers decided with a large majority on the vote to require **Java 7** for the next minor release of Apache Solr (version 4.8)!

The next release will also contain some improvements for Java 7:

* Better file handling (especially on Windows) in the directory implementations. Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).
* Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM.

If you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7.
Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.
The recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption.
Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.
In addition, there is no more Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7.
JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue.
Please also review our list of JVM bugs: <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs>

*EDIT (as of 15 April 2014):* The recently released Java 7u55 fixes the above bug causing index corrumption.
This version is now the recommended version for running Apache Solr.

## 5 March 2014, Apache Solr Ref Guide for 4.7 Available [Â¶](#apache-solr-ref-guide-for-47-available "Permanent link")

# RHSA-2014:1370 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Apache POI security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache POI component that fixes two security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat Fuse Service
Works 6.0.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Apache POI is a library providing Java API for working with OOXML document
files.

It was found that Apache POI would resolve entities in OOXML documents.
A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that are parsed by Apache
POI could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
application server, and potentially perform more advanced XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2014-3529)

It was found that Apache POI would expand an unlimited number of entities
in OOXML documents. A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that
are parsed by Apache POI could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service
attack via excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2014-3574)

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the updates). Before applying the updates, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.
