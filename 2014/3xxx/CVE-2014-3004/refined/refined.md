{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-3004",
    "description": "The Castor libraryâ€™s unmarshalling functionality, if used with default settings, does not prevent the referencing of external entities or doctype declarations, opening up any application that utilizes this functionality to an XXE attack. Under the hood, the Castor library is using the Xerces SAX Parser, which needs to be configured securely in order to prevent these types of attacks. Castor does not have these secure settings turned on in the default configuration file and does not make reference to them anywhere in their documentation.",
    "root_cause": "The Castor library, by default, does not disable external entity resolution in its XML unmarshalling process, leading to XXE vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to retrieve local resources, download malicious code from other servers, and/or open arbitrary TCP connections, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious XML document containing external entity declarations that, when parsed by the vulnerable application, can lead to the exploitation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the XML data that is being processed by the vulnerable application using Castor for unmarshalling."
