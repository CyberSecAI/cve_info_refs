SUSE Security Update: Security update for dbus-1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2014:1146-1
Rating: important
References: #896453
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3638
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
Various denial of service issues were fixed in the DBUS service.
\* CVE-2014-3638: dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages
expect a reply, so that unsolicited replies can be dropped. As
currently implemented, if there are n parallel method calls in
progress, each method reply takes O(n) CPU time. A malicious user
could exploit this by opening the maximum allowed number of parallel
connections and sending the maximum number of parallel method calls
on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be unreasonably
slow, a denial of service.
\* CVE-2014-3639: dbus-daemon allows a small number of "incomplete"
connections (64 by default) whose identity has not yet been
confirmed. When this limit has been reached, subsequent connections
are dropped. Alban's testing indicates that one malicious process
that makes repeated connection attempts, but never completes the
authentication handshake and instead waits for dbus-daemon to time
out and disconnect it, can cause the majority of legitimate
connection attempts to fail.
Security Issues:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)

Subject: CVE-2014-3635 to 3639: security issues in D-Bus < 1.8.8

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed
several security flaws in the reference implementation of
dbus-daemon, the D-Bus message bus daemon. fd.o #83622 is a heap
overflow and could potentially be exploited to alter data or executable
code; the rest are denial-of-service issues.

For the stable branch these are fixed in dbus 1.8.8.

For the old stable branch, these are fixed in dbus 1.6.24. Older
branches are not supported.

CVE-2014-3635 (fd.o #83622)
- ---------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83622>
Category: CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
Impact: heap data corruption, worst-case: arbitrary code execution
Access required: local
Mitigation: 32-bit platforms are not vulnerable
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Simon McVittie

When using the default Unix-socket-based transport, dbus-daemon accepts
and forwards file descriptors (fds) attached to D-Bus messages
("fd-passing"). If the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd
number on 64-bit platforms, a malicious message-sender could pass one
more fd through the kernel than the recipient is expecting. This causes
an assertion failure and dbus-daemon crash if assertions are enabled, or
a buffer overrun by sizeof (int) otherwise.

This has been resolved by passing the desired maximum size to the
syscall instead of the rounded-up size of the cmsg buffer, and
discarding any excess fds if the syscall fills the cmsg buffer anyway.

CVE-2014-3636 (fd.o#82820, parts A and B)
- -----------------------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82820>
Category: CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles
Without Limits or Throttling
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

The default limits for the system bus allowed each uid to open 256
connections to the system bus, and allowed up to 1024 fds per message,
and up to 4096 fds queued in total on each connection.

(Part A) By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious
sender could reach the dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically
65536 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:

* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon
* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that
  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,
  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs
  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds
  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service
  to that sender

(Part B) Additionally, Linux allows up to 253 fds to be sent in a single
sendmsg() call; libdbus always sends all of a message's fds, and the
beginning of the message itself, in a single sendmsg() call. Combining
these two, a malicious sender could split a message across two or more
sendmsg() calls to construct a composite message with 254 or more fds.
When dbus-daemon attempted to relay that message to its
recipient in a single sendmsg() call, it would receive EINVAL,
interpret that as a fatal socket error and disconnect the recipient,
resulting in denial of service.

Both of these related issues have been resolved by changing the defaults
so up to 16 fds are allowed per message, and up to 64 on each
connection. This means that each uid can only queue up to 16384 fds, and
denial of service is only possible if several uids cooperate.

Since this limit might be changed further in future, the D-Bus
maintainers recommend that designers of D-Bus APIs, particularly on the
system bus, do not rely on being able to send more than one fd per
message.

Distributors on operating systems with a smaller default RLIMIT_NOFILE
should consider adjusting either that limit, or the defaults in
system.conf.

CVE-2014-3637 (fd.o#80559)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80559>
Category: CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after
Effective Lifetime
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

By attaching the file descriptor of a D-Bus connection to a D-Bus
message and sending that message via the dbus-daemon, a malicious
process can create D-Bus connections that persist after the process that
created them has terminated. This exacerbates various patterns of
undesirable/abusive behaviour by making it impossible to terminate them
by killing processes.

This has been addressed by closing any connection that has incoming file
descriptors queued for deserialization for more than a configurable
timeout, defaulting to 2.5 minutes.

CVE-2014-3638 (fd.o#81053)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81053>
Category: CWE-407: Algorithmic Complexity
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages expect a reply, so that
unsolicited replies can be dropped. As currently implemented, if there
are n parallel method calls in progress, each method reply takes O(n)
CPU time. A malicious user can exploit this by opening the maximum
allowed number of parallel connections and sending the maximum number of
parallel method calls on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be
unreasonably slow, a denial of service.

For the short term, this has been resolved by amending the default
system bus configuration to reduce the number of parallel method calls
allowed per connection, from 8192 to 128 (i.e. from 2097152 to 32768 per
uid).

Longer-term, we plan to use better data structures to make dbus-daemon
more scalable, but this was not felt to be suitable for a minimal
security patch.

CVE-2014-3639 (fd.o#80919)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80919>
Category: CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without
Limits or Throttling
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

dbus-daemon allows a small number of "incomplete" connections (64 by
default) whose identity has not yet been confirmed. When this limit has
been reached, subsequent connections are dropped. Alban's testing
indicates that one malicious process that makes repeated connection
attempts, but never completes the authentication handshake and instead
waits for dbus-daemon to time out and disconnect it, can cause the
majority of legitimate connection attempts to fail.

This has been resolved by reducing the default authentication timeout
from 30 seconds to 5 seconds, and pausing calls to accept() when the
maximum number of incomplete connections is reached, resulting in
subsequent connections being queued in the kernel (blocking in
connect()) instead of being dropped.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=896453#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-12 11:53:36 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED, via distros  From: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie@collabora.co.uk> Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2014 19:49:06 +0100 Subject: [vs-plain] CVE request for some D-Bus DoS fixes  Hello distro security people,  We would like however many CVE IDs are felt to be appropriate for the vulnerabilities described below, probably at least 2 (one for the file descriptor passing issues that were introduced in 1.3.0, and one for older issues). We intend to fix them all in the same dbus release. Proposed unembargo date: Tuesday 16th September, timing tbd.  The referenced bugs on freedesktop.org are embargoed and non-public. If distro security contacts or dbus maintainers would like access, please open a freedesktop.org Bugzilla account if you don't already have one, and tell me its associated address by private email.  Bugs listed in approximately descending order of worst-case severity.  A preliminary version of the fixes is attached. Patch 0009 and 0011 are non-essential: 0009 silences a compiler warning in 0010, and 0011 adds a regression test.  Thanks,     S  ----8<----  D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.  Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed several denial-of-service flaws in the reference implementation of dbus-daemon, the D-Bus message bus daemon. fd.o #83622 could conceivably also be exploitable to alter data or executable code, but we do not believe that this is likely.  fd.o #83622 -----------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83622> Credit: discovered and fixed by Simon McVittie Impact: denial of service, possibly heap data corruption Access required: local Mitigation: only unusual configurations are vulnerable Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0  When using the default Unix-socket-based transport, dbus-daemon accepts and forwards file descriptors (fds) attached to D-Bus messages ("fd-passing"). If the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd number on 64-bit platforms, a malicious message-sender could pass one more fd through the kernel than the recipient is expecting. This causes an assertion failure and dbus-daemon crash if assertions are enabled, or a buffer overrun by sizeof (int) otherwise.  We do not believe that the buffer overrun can be exploited to alter data or execute arbitrary code in practice, because the buffer that is overrun is allocated with libc realloc(), which typically rounds up odd allocations to a multiple of 8 bytes. This would mean that the overrun could not actually leave the allocated buffer.  This has been resolved by passing the desired maximum size to the syscall instead of the rounded-up size of the cmsg buffer, and discarding any excess fds if the syscall fills the cmsg buffer anyway.  fd.o#82820, part A ------------------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82820> Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy Impact: denial of service Access required: local Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0  The default limits for the system bus allowed each uid to open 256 connections to the system bus, and allowed up to 1024 fds per message, and up to 4096 fds queued in total on each connection.  By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender could reach the dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically 65536 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:  * new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon * when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that   contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,   indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs   do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds   to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service   to that sender  This has been resolved by changing the defaults so up to 16 fds are allowed per message, and up to 64 on each connection. This means that each uid can only queue up to 16384 fds, and denial of service is only possible if several uids cooperate.  Since this limit might be changed further in future, the D-Bus maintainers recommend that designers of D-Bus APIs, particularly on the system bus, do not rely on being able to send more than one fd per message.  Distributors on operating systems with a smaller default RLIMIT_NOFILE should consider adjusting either that limit, or the defaults in system.conf. fd.o#82820, part B ------------------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82820> Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy Impact: denial of service Access required: local Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0  Linux allows up to 253 fds to be sent in a single sendmsg() call; libdbus always sends all of a message's fds, and the beginning of the message itself, in a single sendmsg() call. Combining these two, a malicious sender could split a message across two or more sendmsg() calls to construct a composite message with 254 or more fds. When dbus-daemon attempted to relay that message to its recipient in a single sendmsg() call, it would receive EINVAL, interpret that as a fatal socket error and disconnect the recipient, resulting in denial of service.  This has been resolved by the same change as fd.o #82820, part A.  fd.o#80559 ----------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80559> Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy Impact: denial of service Access required: local Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0  By attaching the file descriptor of a D-Bus connection to a D-Bus message and sending that message via the dbus-daemon, a malicious process can create D-Bus connections that persist after the process that created them has terminated. This exacerbates various patterns of undesirable/abusive behaviour by making it impossible to terminate them by killing processes.  This has been addressed by closing any connection that has incoming file descriptors queued for deserialization for more than a configurable timeout, defaulting to 2.5 minutes.  fd.o#81053 ----------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81053> Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy Impact: denial of service Access required: local Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases  dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages expect a reply, so that unsolicited replies can be dropped. As currently implemented, if there are n parallel method calls in progress, each method reply takes O(n) CPU time. A malicious user can exploit this by opening the maximum allowed number of parallel connections and sending the maximum number of parallel method calls on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be unreasonably slow, a denial of service.  For the short term, this has been resolved by amending the default system bus configuration to reduce the number of parallel method calls allowed per connection, from 8192 to 128 (i.e. from 2097152 to 32768 per uid).  Longer-term, we plan to use better data structures to make dbus-daemon more scalable, but this was not felt to be suitable for a minimal security patch.  fd.o#80919 ----------  Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80919> Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy Impact: denial of service Access required: local Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases  dbus-daemon allows a small number of "incomplete" connections (64 by default) whose identity has not yet been confirmed. When this limit has been reached, subsequent connections are dropped. Alban's testing indicates that one malicious process that makes repeated connection attempts, but never completes the authentication handshake and instead waits for dbus-daemon to time out and disconnect it, can cause the majority of legitimate connection attempts to fail.  This has been resolved by reducing the default authentication timeout from 30 seconds to 5 seconds, and pausing calls to accept() when the maximum number of incomplete connections is reached, resulting in subsequent connections being queued in the kernel (blocking in connect()) instead of being dropped.  ----8<---- ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=896453#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-12

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637 CVE-2014-3638
                 CVE-2014-3639

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in
the D-Bus message daemon.

CVE-2014-3635

    On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by
    local users to cause heap corruption in the dbus-daemon crash,
    leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2014-3636

    A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
    attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
    existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.

CVE-2014-3637

    Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to
    dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the
    participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service
    vulnerability.

CVE-2014-3638

    dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
    code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
    attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.

CVE-2014-3639

    dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from
    local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

,
[CVE-2014-3639](CVE-2014-3639.html)

## Description

```
Updated dbus packages fixes the following security issues:

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in the
D-Bus message daemon:

On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by local users
to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon, leading to a crash, or potentially
to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-3635).

A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local attackers to
prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect existing clients, by
exhausting descriptor limits (CVE-2014-3636).

Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to dbus-daemon which
could not be terminated by killing the participating processes, resulting
in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3637).

dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the code
which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local attackers to
reduce the performance of dbus-daemon (CVE-2014-3638).

dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from local users,
resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3639).

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c0)  Alban Crequy    2014-07-08 14:15:10 UTC  ``` I have an issue with pending replies. It is related to the following limits:  - max_replies_per_connection; default: 1024*8; session=50000 - reply_timeout; default: -1 (disabled) - max_connections_per_user=256 - max_replies total = max_replies_per_connection                       * max_connections_per_user                     = 256*1024*8 per user  So a single user on the system bus could generate up to 2097152 pending replies that dbus-daemon has to track. All pending replies are tracked in the linked list "connections->pending_replies", see bus_connections_check_reply().  So every time a benign connection sends a D-Bus method, dbus-daemon has to iterate over this linked list. It is taking too much time and during that time, it uses the cpu and does not process other D-Bus connections.  While a malicious process creates as many pending requests as it can, I tested how long a benign method takes with the following command:    time dbus-send --system  --print-reply \     --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus /org/freedesktop/DBus \     org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID \     string::1.76  After enough pending replies being added in the linked list, the simple dbus-send takes more than _DBUS_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_VALUE (25 seconds) and it fails.  The "time" command gave me once the following result: real	1m58.026s  The authentication steps are not included in the 25 seconds timeout, that's why "time" displays more than 25 seconds.  So while dbus-daemon is busy looping taking the cpu, D-Bus methods fail (depending on reply_timeout and applications' timeout) and authentication fails (depending on auth_timeout). ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c1)  Alban Crequy    2014-07-10 14:03:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 102539](attachment.cgi?id=102539 "[PATCH] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102539&action=edit "[PATCH] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=102539) [PATCH] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list  With this patch, a message round trip takes less than 5 seconds even with plenty of pending replies.  Given the size of the patch, I expect it still contain bugs and needs more testing:  3 files changed, 532 insertions(+), 213 deletions(-)  As a security workaround, I would like to suggest max_replies_per_connection=128 by default on the system bus. So we would not need an invasive security patch. With this low limit, I don't notice any DoS and a message round-trip is fast. I am not aware of applications needing more than 128 method calls in parallel on the system bus. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c2)  Alban Crequy    2014-07-10 14:30:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 102545](attachment.cgi?id=102545 "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102545&action=edit "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=102545) [PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default  A one-line patch as a security workaround. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c3)  Alban Crequy    2014-07-28 15:04:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 103596](attachment.cgi?id=103596 "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=103596&action=edit "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=103596) [PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list  v2:  - add some documentation  - use the new API in the unit test  - fix counting of deleted & non-deleted items  - fix double free in bus_connections_check_reply  - fix caller/callee confusion in bus_expire_list_foreach  - fix memleaks in case of OOM in _bus_expire_list_add_helper  "make check" passes fine (including with --enable-developer for the memleaks tests). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c4)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-03 17:14:58 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 102545](attachment.cgi?id=102545 "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102545&action=edit "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=102545) [PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default  Review of [attachment 102545](attachment.cgi?id=102545 "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=102545&action=edit "[PATCH] system bus limit: use max_replies_per_connection=128 by default") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=102545): -----------------------------------------------------------------  ::: bus/config-parser.c @@ +467,4 @@ >        /* this is effectively a limit on message queue size for messages >         * that require a reply >         */ > +      parser->limits.max_replies_per_connection = 128;  Before 2007, this was 32, which is too small.  128 seems sane. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c5)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-03 17:17:27 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 103596](attachment.cgi?id=103596 "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=103596&action=edit "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=103596) [PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list  Review of [attachment 103596](attachment.cgi?id=103596 "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=103596&action=edit "[PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=81053&attachment=103596): -----------------------------------------------------------------  This is pretty scary.

Alban, am I right in thinking that this is not > required for the security fix? I would rather do this in 1.9.  That's right: in practice, I have not noticed any issue when max_replies_per_connection is reduced to 128. So I think either patch would prevent the DoS, so we should choose the one-liner for now and the scary patch becomes an optimization which can wait. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c7)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 18:14:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c4)) > 128 seems sane.  I noticed while rummaging through the kdbus implementation that their hard-coded limit happens to also be 128 at the moment, so, yay consistency. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c8)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-12 22:17:58 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-3638 has been allocated for this vulnerability. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c9)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-16 16:36:38 UTC  ``` Vulnerability fixed in 1.8.8, making public ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c10)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-16 16:40:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=81053#c3)) > [PATCH v2] pending replies: use better data structures than a linked list  I have cloned [Bug #83938](show_bug.cgi?id=83938 "RESOLVED MOVED - CVE-2014-3638 follow-up: improve data structures for pending replies") for this.
