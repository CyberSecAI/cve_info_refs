### Bug Description

Received 2014-07-28 18:08:47 +0200 via encrypted E-mail from "Dennis Felsch <email address hidden>":

Hi everyone,

We spotted an issue with Horizon in OpenStack Icehouse and the current

development version of Juno (older versions not tested):

The interface for Host Aggregates is vulnerable to persistent XSS.

Steps to reproduce the issue:

\* Log into Horizon as admin

 \* Go to "Host Aggregates"

 \* Create a new host aggregate

 \* Enter some name and an availability zone like this: <svg onload=alert(1)>

 \* Save

 \* See alert pop up

Because we are researchers, we are happy to help you, whenever we can.

However, from the research point of view, it would be really nice to get

some acknowledgment on your site about this issue. Is something

like this possible?

The people working on this are:

Dennis Felsch (me), <email address hidden>

Mario Heiderich, <email address hidden>

Please let me know if you need more info.

Greetings,

Dennis

Thank you for the bug report. I just reproduced on the master branch.

This is happening for the AZ name in the metadata column. This is caused by horizon using the 'unordered\_list' django filter outside the context of a template, causing autoescaping not to be switched on and the input not to be sanitised. A quick check suggests this is the only file in the codebase where we're using this filter.

With regard to the impact, I think it is limited because only admins are allowed to create host aggregates and availability zones.

As indicated in the description Icehouse is likely affected too. The aggregates panel didn't exist in Havana. In Havana though, the 'unordered\_list' filter was used when displaying availability zones in the System Info admin panel (read-only from the dashboard at the time). I'll test and backport the fix there too just to be safe.

Here's a proposed patch for the issue. It also applies cleanly on icehouse (where I was able to reproduce the problem), I'll provide a havana version later on.

It's the second time we get bitten by the way we use filters in python files (cf. [bug 1320235](/bugs/1320235)), after a solution for this gets merged I'll look into refactoring the solutions so they're more reusable. Maybe in a horizon/tables/filters.py file for filters known to be problematic, or introspecting for an autoescape argument so that might be too costly performance-wise...

@Julie Thanks for the quick patch and severity analysis!

Here is the impact description draft #1:

Title: Persistent XSS in Horizon Host Aggregates interface

Reporters: Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich (Ruhr-University Bochum)

Products: Horizon

Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:

Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum reported a persistent XSS in Horizon. A malicious administrator may conduct a persistent XSS attack by registering a malicious host aggregate in Horizon Host Aggregate interface. Once executed in a legitimate context these attacks may result in potential asset stealing (horizon user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management, tenants' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon setups are affected.

One question here is wheter there is such a thing as a "malicious administrator", and if that vulnerability really elevates privileges or gives the attacker information/rights he can't otherwise access. My understanding is that the admin user already has access to most of the assets mentioned ? Is this vulnerability giving him any extra access ? Like being able to impersonate users by stealing their creds ?

<tristanC> Does stealing other admin access isn't a concern ? You can get lateral escalation no ?

<ttx> hmm, yeah, I like that

<ttx> would defeat auditing

<ttx> OK, I buy it

So let's do an OSSA here to be sure.

Here's the Havana patch, tested on a DevStack system. It's more of a "patch recreation" than backport because the affected file on master didn't exist during Havana, but the patch is easy enough to follow anyway.

Looks good, minor nitpick:

"may reveal another admin token resulting" ->

"may reveal another admin token, potentially resulting"

...since 2014.1.2 was released a week ago and doesn't contain a fix as far as I can tell.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1336)

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue and
several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the horizon host
aggregate interface. A user with sufficient privileges to add a host
aggregate could potentially use this flaw to capture the credentials of
another user. (CVE-2014-3594)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst
Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum as the original
reporters.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the "Create an Image" page rendering was blocked

during a file upload. This could cause the browser to disconnect after a
certain period of time, especially when uploading large files. With this
update, the upload is handled in a separate thread, and large image uploads
started via the web dashboard are less likely to time out and fail.
(BZ#1089672)

* Creating a user using keystoneclient could fail because keystoneclient

attempted to create a role for the new user when setting up the user.
When a role already existed, this operation failed and a new user was not
created. This update fixes this bug, and user creation works as expected.
(BZ#1094494)

All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata

### Bug Description

Received 2014-07-28 18:08:47 +0200 via encrypted E-mail from "Dennis Felsch <email address hidden>":

Hi everyone,

We spotted an issue with Horizon in OpenStack Icehouse and the current

development version of Juno (older versions not tested):

The interface for Host Aggregates is vulnerable to persistent XSS.

Steps to reproduce the issue:

\* Log into Horizon as admin

 \* Go to "Host Aggregates"

 \* Create a new host aggregate

 \* Enter some name and an availability zone like this: <svg onload=alert(1)>

 \* Save

 \* See alert pop up

Because we are researchers, we are happy to help you, whenever we can.

However, from the research point of view, it would be really nice to get

some acknowledgment on your site about this issue. Is something

like this possible?

The people working on this are:

Dennis Felsch (me), <email address hidden>

Mario Heiderich, <email address hidden>

Please let me know if you need more info.

Greetings,

Dennis

Thank you for the bug report. I just reproduced on the master branch.

This is happening for the AZ name in the metadata column. This is caused by horizon using the 'unordered\_list' django filter outside the context of a template, causing autoescaping not to be switched on and the input not to be sanitised. A quick check suggests this is the only file in the codebase where we're using this filter.

With regard to the impact, I think it is limited because only admins are allowed to create host aggregates and availability zones.

As indicated in the description Icehouse is likely affected too. The aggregates panel didn't exist in Havana. In Havana though, the 'unordered\_list' filter was used when displaying availability zones in the System Info admin panel (read-only from the dashboard at the time). I'll test and backport the fix there too just to be safe.

Here's a proposed patch for the issue. It also applies cleanly on icehouse (where I was able to reproduce the problem), I'll provide a havana version later on.

It's the second time we get bitten by the way we use filters in python files (cf. [bug 1320235](/bugs/1320235)), after a solution for this gets merged I'll look into refactoring the solutions so they're more reusable. Maybe in a horizon/tables/filters.py file for filters known to be problematic, or introspecting for an autoescape argument so that might be too costly performance-wise...

@Julie Thanks for the quick patch and severity analysis!

Here is the impact description draft #1:

Title: Persistent XSS in Horizon Host Aggregates interface

Reporters: Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich (Ruhr-University Bochum)

Products: Horizon

Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:

Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum reported a persistent XSS in Horizon. A malicious administrator may conduct a persistent XSS attack by registering a malicious host aggregate in Horizon Host Aggregate interface. Once executed in a legitimate context these attacks may result in potential asset stealing (horizon user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management, tenants' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon setups are affected.

One question here is wheter there is such a thing as a "malicious administrator", and if that vulnerability really elevates privileges or gives the attacker information/rights he can't otherwise access. My understanding is that the admin user already has access to most of the assets mentioned ? Is this vulnerability giving him any extra access ? Like being able to impersonate users by stealing their creds ?

<tristanC> Does stealing other admin access isn't a concern ? You can get lateral escalation no ?

<ttx> hmm, yeah, I like that

<ttx> would defeat auditing

<ttx> OK, I buy it

So let's do an OSSA here to be sure.

Here's the Havana patch, tested on a DevStack system. It's more of a "patch recreation" than backport because the affected file on master didn't exist during Havana, but the patch is easy enough to follow anyway.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-django-horizon security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1335)

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue and
several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the horizon host
aggregate interface. A user with sufficient privileges to add a host
aggregate could potentially use this flaw to capture the credentials of
another user. (CVE-2014-3594)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst
Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum as the original
reporters.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the "Create an Image" page rendering was blocked

during a file upload. This could cause the browser to disconnect after a
certain period of time, especially when uploading large files. With this
update, the upload is handled in a separate thread, and large image uploads
started via the web dashboard are less likely to time out and fail.
(BZ#1089672)

* Creating a user using keystoneclient could fail because keystoneclient

attempted to create a role for the new user when setting up the user.
When a role already existed, this operation failed and a new user was not
created. This update fixes this bug, and user creation works as expected.
(BZ#1094494)

All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
