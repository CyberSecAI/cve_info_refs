  "CVE-2014-3594": {
    "description": "A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Host Aggregates interface of OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon). A malicious administrator may inject arbitrary web script or HTML by creating a host aggregate with a crafted availability zone name. When a legitimate user views the aggregate, the injected script will execute.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "up to 2013.2.3",
      "2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The 'unordered_list' Django filter was used outside the context of a template, which caused autoescaping to be disabled and the input was not sanitized.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious administrator can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to: - Stealing of horizon user/admin access credentials. - Compromise of VMs/Network configuration/management. - Exposure of tenants' confidential information. - Lateral privilege escalation by stealing other admin tokens.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious administrator creates a host aggregate through the Horizon web interface and includes a malicious payload in the 'availability zone' field.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires administrative privileges within the Horizon dashboard to create host aggregates.",
     "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability was present in the display of the AZ name within the metadata column for Host Aggregates.",
        "The 'unordered_list' filter was also used in the System Info admin panel in Havana (read-only at the time) when displaying availability zones, and the fix was backported there for safety.",
        "The vulnerability allowed for persistent XSS attacks since the malicious payload was stored and executed each time the affected page was viewed by other users."
