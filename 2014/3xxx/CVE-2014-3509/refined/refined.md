Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the `ssl_parse_serverhello_tlsext()` function within OpenSSL. This function handles the "Supported EC Point Format" extension during a TLS/SSL handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to shared memory during the handling of the "Supported EC Point Format" extension in multi-threaded clients.
- **Use-After-Free:** A malicious server can exploit the race condition by sending a ServerHello with this extension in a resumed session to cause the client to write up to 255 bytes to previously freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can cause a crash in the multi-threaded client application due to a write to freed memory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In some cases, the memory corruption could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code, depending on the system and the application using OpenSSL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered over a network connection, specifically during the TLS/SSL handshake.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Server:** A malicious server can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Specifically crafted ServerHello:** The malicious server sends a ServerHello message with a specific format. The vulnerability is only triggered if an "ec point format extension" is included in the ServerHello and the client has established a resumed session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker must be able to control a server that the vulnerable client connects to.
- **TLS/SSL Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a good understanding of the TLS/SSL handshake and the "Supported EC Point Format" extension.
- **Multi-threaded Client:** The client must be multi-threaded for the race condition to occur.
- **Resumed Session:** The client must connect to the server using a resumed session

**Additional Details (from content):**
- The issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.0 and later, since it was introduced with the support for Supported Point Formats Extension for ECC ciphersuites.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier which were based on upstream OpenSSL 0.9.8 and earlier were not affected. Similarly, RHEL6 prior to RHBA-2013:1585 was not affected as Elliptic Curve Cryptography was not enabled.
- Several vendors including HP, Oracle, Red Hat and Debian issued security patches and advisories for this vulnerability in their products.

In summary, CVE-2014-3509 is a race condition in OpenSSL that allows a malicious server to crash multi-threaded clients, and potentially execute arbitrary code, by sending a specially crafted ServerHello message.
