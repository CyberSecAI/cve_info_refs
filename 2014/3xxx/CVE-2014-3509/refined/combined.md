This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a higher protocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records.  OpenSSL 1.0.1 SSL/TLS server users should upgrade to 1.0.1i.  Thanks to David Benjamin and Adam Langley (Google) for discovering and researching this issue. This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 21st July 2014.

# OpenSSL Vulnerabilities related to Version 1.0.1i

Submitted on 8. August 2014 - 21:17 by rischi.
Last update on 13. March 2017 - 8:31.
IDs: CVE-2014-3512, CVE-2014-3511, CVE-2014-3510, CVE-2014-3507, CVE-2014-3506, CVE-2014-3505, CVE-2014-3509, CVE-2014-5139, CVE-2014-3508Keywords: opensslDescription:

OpenSSL released a new version 1.0.1i. The update fixes several security issues. Airlock may be affected by two issues (CVE-2014-3511, CVE-2014-3509). The other 7 issues are related to the DTLS protocol or to the cipher suites SRP and aECDH which are by default not used by Airlock. We rate the criticality of the issues as moderate.

Resolution:

We recommend to update OpenSSL to version 1.0.1i with hotfix HF4226 for Airlock 4.2.6.x and HF5005 for Airlock 5.0, respectively. The hotfixes will be available within the next few days.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0197)

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix two security issues and
several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

A race condition was found in the way OpenSSL handled ServerHello messages
with an included Supported EC Point Format extension. A malicious server
could possibly use this flaw to cause a multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using
OpenSSL to write into freed memory, causing the client to crash or execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3509)

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server
using OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server
supported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, various clipboard managers, operating on the client or on the

guest, would occasionally lose synchronization, which resulted in clipboard
data loss and the SPICE console freezing. Now, spice-gtk have been patched,
such that clipboard synchronization does not freeze the SPICE console
anymore. (BZ#1083489)

* Prior to this update, when a SPICE console was launched from the Red Hat

Enterprise Virtualization User Portal with the 'Native Client' invocation
method and 'Open in Full Screen' selected, the displays of the guest
virtual machine were not always configured to match the client displays.
After this update, the SPICE console will show a full-screen guest display
for each client monitor. (BZ#1076243)

* A difference in behavior between Linux and Windows clients caused an

extra nul character to be sent when pasting text in a guest machine from a
Windows client. This invisible character was visible in some Java
applications. With this update, the extra nul character is removed from
text strings and no more extraneous character would appear. (BZ#1090122)

* Previously, If the clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the data is of 0

size, GTK+ will crash. With this update, the data size is checked first,
and GTK+ no longer crashes when clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the
data is of 0 size. (BZ#1090433)

* Modifier-only key combinations cannot be registered by users as hotkeys

so if a user tries to set a modifier-only key sequence (for example,
'ctrl+alt') as the hotkey for releasing the cursor, it will fail, and the
user will be able to release the cursor from the window. With this update,
when a modifier-only hotkey is attempted to be registered, it will fall
back to the default cursor-release sequence (which happens to be
'ctrl+alt'). (BZ#985319)

* Display configuration sometimes used outdated information about the

position of the remote-viewer windows in order to align and configure the
guest displays. Occasionally, this caused the guest displays to became
unexpectedly swapped when a window is resized. With this update,
remote-viewer will always use the current window locations to align
displays, rather than using a possibly outdated cached location
information. (BZ#1018182)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

CVE Name: CVE-2014-3506, CVE-2014-3507, CVE-2014-3508, CVE-2014-3510,
CVE-2014-3509, CVE-2014-3511, CVE-2014-3512, CVE-2014-5139
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
The receipt of a specifically crafted DTLS handshake message may cause OpenSSL
to consume large amounts of memory. [CVE-2014-3506]
The receipt of a specifically crafted DTLS packet could cause OpenSSL to leak
memory. [CVE-2014-3507]
A flaw in OBJ\_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as
X509\_name\_oneline, X509\_name\_print\_ex et al. to leak some information from
the stack. [CVE-2014-3508]
OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject to
a denial of service attack. [CVE-2014-3510]
The following problems affect FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE and later:
If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed
session and the server sends an ec point format extension it could write
up to 255 bytes to freed memory. [CVE-2014-3509]
A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate
TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message
is badly fragmented. [CVE-2014-3511]
A malicious client or server can send invalid SRP parameters and overrun
an internal buffer. [CVE-2014-3512]
A malicious server can crash the client with a NULL pointer dereference by
specifying a SRP ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated
with the client. [CVE-2014-5139]
III. Impact
A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service (application
crash, large memory consumption), obtain additional information,
cause protocol downgrade. Additionally, a remote attacker may be able
to run arbitrary code on a vulnerable system if the application has been
set up for SRP.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-10.0.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-10.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.0.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.3.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.3.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.2, 9.1, 8.4]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3505 CVE-2014-3506 CVE-2014-3507 CVE-2014-3508
                 CVE-2014-3509 CVE-2014-3510 CVE-2014-3511 CVE-2014-3512
                 CVE-2014-5139

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit, that may result in denial of service
(application crash, large memory consumption), information leak,
protocol downgrade. Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only
applications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed (CVE-2014-3512).

Detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:
<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt>

It's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just
the openssl package.

All applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use
the "checkrestart" tool from the debian-goodies package to detect
affected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u12.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1i-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

# Security Advisory-9 OpenSSL vulnerabilities on Huawei products

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20141008-OpenSSL
* Initial Release Date:
  Oct 08, 2014
* Last Release Date:
  Mar 11, 2015

Summary

This security advisory (SA) describes the impact of 9 OpenSSL vulnerabilities discovered in third-party software. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2014-0816)

These vulnerabilities are referenced in this document as follows:

1.Information leak in pretty printing functions (CVE-2014-3508). A flaw in OBJ\_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as X509\_name\_oneline, X509\_name\_print\_ex et al. to leak some information from the stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing output to the attacker. OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers themselves are not affected.

The NVD link is: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3508>

2.Crash with SRP ciphersuite in Server Hello message (CVE-2014-5139). The issue affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash the client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated with the client. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5139

3.Race condition in ssl\_parse\_serverhello\_tlsext (CVE-2014-3509). If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed session and the server   sends an ec point format extension it could write up to 255 bytes to freed memory.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3509

4.Double Free when processing DTLS packets (CVE-2014-3505). An attacker can force an error condition which causes openssl to crash whilst processing DTLS packets due to memory being freed twice. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3505

5.DTLS memory exhaustion (CVE-2014-3506). An attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts of memory whilst processing DTLS handshake messages. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3506

6.DTLS memory leak from zero-length fragments (CVE-2014-3507). By sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker could cause openssl to leak memory. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3507

7.OpenSSL DTLS anonymous EC(DH) denial of service (CVE-2014-3510). OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject to a denial of service attack. A malicious server can crash the client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake messages.

The NVD link is: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3510>

8.OpenSSL TLS protocol downgrade attack (CVE-2014-3511). A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message is badly fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a higher protocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3511

9.SRP buffer overrun (CVE-2014-3512). A malicious client or server can send invalid SRP parameters and overrun an internal buffer. Only applications which are explicitly set up for SRP use are affected.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3512

The9 vulnerabilities affect the Huawei products that use OpenSSL. Some Products have provided the fixed versions.

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to cause a Denial of Service condition,
perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, or
bypass security restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1j"

```

All OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8z_p2"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying these packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
