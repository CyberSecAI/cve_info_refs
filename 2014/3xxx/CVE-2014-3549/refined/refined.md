Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3549

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient filtering of log entries related to failed login attempts. Specifically, the system was not properly sanitizing user-supplied data before including it in the logs, creating an avenue for malicious code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Unfiltered log entries allowed malicious JavaScript code to be embedded in the failed login logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the failed login logs. When an administrator views these logs through the Moodle interface, the embedded JavaScript is executed within the administrator's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker could potentially use this XSS to steal administrator session cookies or other sensitive information, enabling them to take control of the admin account.
*  **Malicious Actions:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution allows attackers to perform any action an administrator can, including modifying the Moodle site, creating new user accounts, or accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Failed Login Attempts:** An attacker needs to create a failed login attempt with a username or other log information containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Log Access:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the failed login logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No special access needed:** An attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the Moodle system itself to inject the malicious code. Any user can trigger the failed login attempts.
*   **Admin interaction required:** Exploitation requires an administrator to view the affected logs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is rated as "Serious"
* The affected version is 2.7 and the fix is included in version 2.7.1
* The issue was reported by Skylar Kelty and is tracked under MDL-46201
