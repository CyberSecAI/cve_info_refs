Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A bug exists in the nginx SMTP proxy that allows command injection into SSL sessions initiated with the STARTTLS command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Injection:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to inject plaintext commands into an encrypted SSL session after STARTTLS is used, effectively breaking the intended security of the encrypted connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information transmitted by clients during the SMTP session. This could include usernames, passwords, email content, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Privileged Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, indicating a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is required. The attacker must be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the nginx SMTP proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between a client and an nginx server acting as an SMTP proxy.
- **Traffic Manipulation:**  The attacker needs to be capable of injecting arbitrary data into the communication stream.

**Affected Versions:**

- nginx versions 1.5.6 to 1.7.3 are vulnerable.

**Fix:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in nginx versions 1.7.4 and 1.6.1.
- A patch is also available: `http://nginx.org/download/patch.2014.starttls.txt`

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves resetting the buffer's position and last pointers after STARTTLS command.
```c
+ s->buffer->pos = s->buffer->start;
+ s->buffer->last = s->buffer->start;
```
- Red Hat stated that this issue did not affect the versions of nginx as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
