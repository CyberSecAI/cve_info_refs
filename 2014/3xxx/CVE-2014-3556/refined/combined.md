Hello!

A bug in nginx SMTP proxy was found, which allows an attacker in a
privileged network position to inject commands into SSL sessions started
with the STARTTLS command, potentially making it possible to steal
sensitive information sent by clients (CVE-2014-3556).

The problem affects nginx 1.5.6 - 1.7.3.

The problem is fixed in nginx 1.7.4, 1.6.1.

Patch for the problem can be found here:

<http://nginx.org/download/patch.2014.starttls.txt>

Thanks to Chris Boulton for discovering this.
