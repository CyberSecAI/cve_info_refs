- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `open_by_handle_at()` function allows a process to access files on a mounted filesystem using a file_handle structure that relies on inode numbers. This bypasses simfs restrictions in OpenVZ containers.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the use of inode numbers within the file_handle structure, enabling access to files outside the container's boundaries. The `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability, which is granted to the superuser within the container by default, is required to trigger the vulnerability. This allows an attacker to bypass simfs file system restrictions.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to files on the underlying filesystem, including those belonging to other Virtual Environments (VEs) residing on the same filesystem. This means a complete file system breakout from a container and can potentially read files from other containers.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves calling the `open_by_handle_at()` function within the container with the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have root privileges within an OpenVZ container, which provides the `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. They need to be in a RHEL6-based OpenVZ environment using simfs with a vulnerable kernel. The attacker would need to use `open_by_handle_at()` to perform the attack.
