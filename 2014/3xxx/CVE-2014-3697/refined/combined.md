| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c0)  Cornel Diaconu   2014-04-22 12:19:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 587239](attachment.cgi?id=587239 "debug messages from pidgin session") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=587239&action=edit "debug messages from pidgin session") debug messages from pidgin session  User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0  My instant messenger pidgin (version 2.10.9-4.12.1) refuses to connect to yahoo servers anymore, since a few weeks already. I would bet this is not related to the recent heartbleed bug(s) in the SSL layer, since I have this problem before the spread of that problem. After setting pidgin to report debug messages into a file I get this exact error messages: (09:04:19) yahoo: Login Failed, unable to retrieve login url: Error reading from login.yahoo.com: Input/output error (09:04:19) connection: Connection error on 0xb8b5ce90 (reason: 0 description: Error reading from login.yahoo.com: Input/output error)   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. start pidgin 2. try to login to the (yahoo) messenger account  Actual Results:   pidgin reports error about "Error reading from login.yahoo.com: Input/output error"  Expected Results:   login to the desired account  gnutls packages are all up to date (versions 3.2.4-2.18.1). Openssl is up to date, as well (version 1.0.1e-11.32.1) So I think the issue is not related to the current SSL bug (heartbleed).  Curious thing: at the same time, kopete succeeds in connecting to the same user account (yahoo messenger user). So there isn't any issues with the account (like being blocked somehow).  Some user at this thread on the forums: <https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/497190-Pidgin-%282-10-9%29-still-not-connecting-to-Yahoo-%28Opensuse-13-1%29> states he does NOT have this issue with the same pidgin version but on Ubuntu. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2014-04-23 05:47:42 UTC  ``` no, its realted to gnutls  can be reproduced by the commandline client:  $ gnutls-cli login.yahoo.com ... debug output ...  GET /<return> <!-- l12.member.ir2.yahoo.com uncompressed/chunked Tue Apr 22 22:47:07 PDT 2014 --> *** Fatal error: The TLS connection was non-properly terminated. *** Server has terminated the connection abnormally. $ ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2014-04-23 06:08:20 UTC  ``` <https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/16172>   seems a yahoo issue ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c3)  Cornel Diaconu   2014-04-23 06:22:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c2)) > <https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/16172>   seems a yahoo issue  Hmm... I think it's still related somehow to gnutls (but maybe, yes, due to yahoo part this time; still the culprit seems to be gnutls on our side; I mean gnutls does not connect to yahoo anymore due to some strange yahoo change in these recent weeks).  On comment nr. 8 at that page, someone suggests that if I compile pidgin from source, with this option: --enable-gnutls=no , after installing pidgin this way, it should work OK (it should use Mozila nss, instead of gnutls). Didn't tried it this way, though. So far. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2014-04-23 06:39:15 UTC  ``` well yes, gnutls considers a connection finish without the proper tls close packet from remote a error...  pidgin might be patched to be more relaxed about that ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-10 12:05:09 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2014:1376-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has one errata is now available.

Strangely, without any clue about what was wrong with older pidgin from OS 13.1 (just before installing OS 13.2, I had used pidgin 2.10.9-4.18.1, as the latest version available for OS 13.1) :( Well, that being said (written), this bug I don't know if we can consider it solved. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=874606#c8)  Dominique Leuenberger   2014-11-26 15:38:52 UTC  ``` With the release of 2.10.10, this bug has been fixed (until next time they change their servers) ``` |  |

openSUSE Security Update: update for pidgin
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1376-1
Rating: moderate
References: #853038 #874606 #902408 #902409 #902410 #902495
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3694 CVE-2014-3695 CVE-2014-3696
CVE-2014-3697 CVE-2014-3698
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.1
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The following issues were fixed in this update:
+ General:
- Check the basic constraints extension when validating SSL/TLS
certificates. This fixes a security hole that allowed a malicious
man-in-the-middle to impersonate an IM server or any other https
endpoint. This affected both the NSS and GnuTLS plugins
(CVE-2014-3694, boo#902495).
- Allow and prefer TLS 1.2 and 1.1 when using the NSS plugin for SSL
(im#15909).
+ libpurple3 compatibility:
- Encrypted account passwords are preserved until the new one is set.
- Fix loading Google Talk and Facebook XMPP accounts.
+ Groupwise: Fix potential remote crash parsing server message that
indicates that a large amount of memory should be allocated
(CVE-2014-3696, boo#902410).
+ IRC: Fix a possible leak of unencrypted data when using /me command
with OTR (im#15750).
+ MXit: Fix potential remote crash parsing a malformed emoticon response
(CVE-2014-3695, boo#902409).
+ XMPP:
- Fix potential information leak where a malicious XMPP server and
possibly even a malicious remote user could create a carefully
crafted XMPP message that causes libpurple to send an XMPP message
containing arbitrary memory (CVE-2014-3698, boo#902408).
+ Yahoo: Fix login when using the GnuTLS library for TLS connections
(im#16172, boo#874606).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
- Update to version 2.10.10:
+ General:
- Check the basic constraints extension when validating SSL/TLS
certificates. This fixes a security hole that allowed a malicious
man-in-the-middle to impersonate an IM server or any other https
endpoint. This affected both the NSS and GnuTLS plugins
(CVE-2014-3694, boo#902495).
- Allow and prefer TLS 1.2 and 1.1 when using the NSS plugin for SSL
(im#15909).
+ libpurple3 compatibility:
- Encrypted account passwords are preserved until the new one is set.
- Fix loading Google Talk and Facebook XMPP accounts.
+ Windows-Specific Changes: Don't allow overwriting arbitrary files on
the file system when the user installs a smiley theme via
drag-and-drop (CVE-2014-3697).
+ Finch: Fix build against Python 3 (im#15969).
+ Gadu-Gadu: Updated internal libgadu to version 1.12.0.
+ Groupwise: Fix potential remote crash parsing server message that
indicates that a large amount of memory should be allocated
(CVE-2014-3696, boo#902410).
+ IRC: Fix a possible leak of unencrypted data when using /me command
with OTR (im#15750).
+ MXit: Fix potential remote crash parsing a malformed emoticon response
(CVE-2014-3695, boo#902409).
+ XMPP:
- Fix potential information leak where a malicious XMPP server and
possibly even a malicious remote user could create a carefully
crafted XMPP message that causes libpurple to send an XMPP message
containing arbitrary memory (CVE-2014-3698, boo#902408).
- Fix Facebook XMPP roster quirks (im#15041, im#15957).
+ Yahoo: Fix login when using the GnuTLS library for TLS connections
(im#16172, boo#874606).
- Drop pidgin-gstreamer1.patch: causes crashes and Video still does not
work (boo#853038). Drop BuildRequires conditions switching to GStreamer
1.0.
- Rebase pidgin-crash-missing-gst-registry.patch.
+ add pidgin-crash-missing-gst-registry.patch according to the GST doc,
"gst\_init" should be called before any other calls.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c0)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2013-11-30 09:12:31 UTC  ``` According to different references on the pidgin site and other descriptions out there pidgin is supposed to have jingle based xmpp video/voice support. (e.g. <http://michael.stapelberg.de/Artikel/video_chat_with_pidgin>)  I cannot find any way to enable this in our pidgin though. Unless I missed any additional plugin packages there is something missing to make this work. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c1)  Dominique Leuenberger   2013-11-30 16:05:23 UTC  ```  From the build log:  [  857s] Build with voice and video.... : no  And configure verifies (to get to this conclusion):   if test "x$enable_gstreamer" != "xno" -a "x$enable_gstinterfaces" != "xno" -a "x$enable_farstream" != "xno"; then                 AC_DEFINE(USE_VV, 1, [Use voice and video])   Build log also says:  [  849s] checking for GSTREAMER... yes [  849s] checking for gst_registry_fork_set_enabled in -lgstreamer-1.0... yes [  849s] checking for FARSTREAM... no   => so, GSTreamer is present, farstream not detected.  The check from above though is not valid with GStreamer 1.0: gstinterfaces had been deprecated; as a result, it will never be true (one part of the problem: the check in configure is wrong).  Another issue is that farstream is being checked for farstream-0.1; which has long been changed to farstream-0.2.  Due to configure not having --enable-vv passed, the was based on 'auto detect' and the feature was transparently lost with the update (back in March) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c2)  Dominique Leuenberger   2013-11-30 16:56:09 UTC  ``` Tue Oct  9 10:05:59 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org  - Pass --disable-vv to configure, as farstream 0.2 support is not   avaialble yet.  Was actually the 'root of the evil', why the port to GStreamer never caught this as a missing feature. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c3)  Dominique Leuenberger   2013-11-30 22:57:14 UTC  ``` I fixed up the build system of pidgin sufficiently to recognize and build all the GStreamer 1.0 parts (based on upstream commits).  Can you please test-run the packages in home:dimstar:branches:GNOME:Apps for a while to confirm if this work as expected for you? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c4)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2013-12-02 21:21:36 UTC  ``` Could you please enable the build for 13.1? Factory already has new dependencies. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c5)  Dominique Leuenberger   2013-12-03 16:08:32 UTC  ``` DOH! Thanks.. done.. building and publishing in progress ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c6)  Dominique Leuenberger   2014-01-13 21:46:32 UTC  ``` Dear Reporter,  Thank you very much for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make openSUSE better.  Unfortunately, you were not able (timewise or otherwise) to provide the needed input to progress further with this bug. For this reason, we are marking the bug as 'FIXED/NORESPONSE' for now. This does NOT mean we are not willing to work on this issue together with you; should you be able to provide the information asked for, you can simply add this information and change the status back to REOPENED, which will resume the ticket immediately.  Thank you for your understanding.  Truly yours, ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c7)  Rafał Miłecki   2014-03-03 14:56:53 UTC  ``` Dominique: I can confirm the same problem, also using openSuSE 13.1  With openSuSE's default pidgin: pidgin-2.10.9-4.12.1.x86_64 I can see in the "Information" dialog: Pidgin 2.10.9 (libpurple 2.10.9) Voice and Video: Disabled  After installing pidgin-2.10.7-108.1.x86_64 package from [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dimstar:/branches:/GNOME:/Apps/openSUSE_13.1/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home%3A/dimstar%3A/branches%3A/GNOME%3A/Apps/openSUSE_13.1/) my Pidgin's dialog shows: Pidgin 2.10.7 (libpurple 2.10.9) Voice and Video: Enabled  So I think your change helps. I still didn't test voice & video, but it looks that Pidgin is now compiled correctly. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c8)  Dominique Leuenberger   2014-07-24 19:32:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 883679](show_bug.cgi?id=883679 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - pidgin voice-video settings plugin missing in 13.1") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c9)  James Carter   2014-07-25 18:44:20 UTC  ``` @dimstar, I made some progress in testing last night but it was too late to post the results.  There were several items that held back progress.    The correct URL (at least today) for the package is [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/dimstar:/branches:/GNOME:/Apps/openSUSE_Factory/x86_64/pidgin-2.10.7-108.1.x86_64.rpm](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home%3A/dimstar%3A/branches%3A/GNOME%3A/Apps/openSUSE_Factory/x86_64/pidgin-2.10.7-108.1.x86_64.rpm) (vs. openSUSE_13.1)  I already had pidgin-2.10.9-4.18.1.x86_64 from v13.1 (updates), so --oldpackage was needed to get the RPM to install.  It depends on perl-base = 5.18.2 , v13.1 has perl-5.18.1-2.1.11.x86_64 ; I told zypper "break pidgin by ignoring dependency".    Pidgin starts with no error messages.  I could log in and do text IM.  But in Buddy List - Tools - Plugins, I don't see the video/voice setup plugin, even though the RPM has pixmaps for video-call.png and audio-call.png.  Plugins in /usr/lib64/pidgin/*.so match up with the listed plugins and none looks video-ish.  Neither do any of the other files in the RPM except those two pixmaps.  In dimstar's repo there are no separate packages with names that seem relevant.  Referring to <http://michael.stapelberg.de/Artikel/video_chat_with_pidgin> , he reports installing GStremer infrastructure but no special plugin package for video/voice.  So I tried compiling from source (from dimstar's repo).  The plan was to look at the .configure log and try to spot why --enable-vv was not honored.  Oopsie, when I updated GStreamer from Packman I didn't install gstreamer-devel, and now I can't get the matching version, so I'm going to have to update all of GStreamer.  That will have to be this evening.    @dimstar, thanks for managing this issue, and it must be frustrating that progress is so slow due to the lack of beta testing. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c10)  James Carter   2014-08-05 05:07:09 UTC  ``` OK, I got the build dependencies installed.  It only needed five GStreamer packages from Packman (gstreamer gstreamer-utils libgstreamer-1_0-0 gstreamer-devel typelib-1_0-Gst-1_0).    translation-update-upstream is incredibly resource intensive.  You can bypass it by: export SKIP_TUU=true .  It ended up configuring with these options; I'm showing all of them just in case my judgment of what's uninteresting is wrong.   /configure      --host=x86_64-suse-linux-gnu      --build=x86_64-suse-linux-gnu      --program-prefix=      --disable-dependency-tracking      --prefix=/usr      --exec-prefix=/usr      --bindir=/usr/bin      --sbindir=/usr/sbin      --sysconfdir=/etc      --datadir=/usr/share      --includedir=/usr/include      --libdir=/usr/lib64      --libexecdir=/usr/lib      --localstatedir=/var      --sharedstatedir=/usr/com      --mandir=/usr/share/man      --infodir=/usr/share/info      --disable-dependency-tracking      --disable-static      --disable-schemas-install      --enable-plugins      --enable-cyrus-sasl      --enable-dbus      --disable-mono      --enable-gstreamer      --enable-nm      --enable-dbus      --enable-devhelp      --enable-vv     <== This is the key item     --with-tclconfig=/usr/lib64      --with-tkconfig=/usr/lib64      --with-system-ssl-certs=/etc/ssl/certs  ./configure output included these messages among tons of others: checking for GSTVIDEO... yes checking for FARSTREAM... yes checking for IDN... yes  The complete configuration summary is: pidgin 2.10.7  Build GTK+ 2.x UI............. : yes Build console UI.............. : yes Build for X11................. : yes  Enable Gestures............... : yes Protocols to build dynamically : bonjour gg irc jabber msn myspace mxit novell o scar sametime silc simple yahoo zephyr Protocols to link statically.. :  Build with GStreamer support.. : yes Build with D-Bus support...... : yes Build with voice and video.... : yes     <=== Key item D-Bus services directory...... : /usr/share/dbus-1/services Build with GNU Libidn......... : yes Build with NetworkManager..... : yes SSL Library/Libraries......... : Mozilla NSS and GnuTLS SSL CA certificates directory. : /etc/ssl/certs Build with Cyrus SASL support. : yes Use kerberos 4 with zephyr.... : no Use external libzephyr........ : no Use external libgadu.......... : yes Install pixmaps............... : yes Old tray icon compatibility... : no Install translations.......... : yes Has you....................... : yes  Use XScreenSaver Extension.... : yes Use X Session Management...... : yes Use startup notification...... : yes Build with GtkSpell support... : yes  Build with plugin support..... : yes Build with Mono support....... : no Build with Perl support....... : yes Build with Tcl support........ : yes Build with Tk support......... : yes  Print debugging messages...... : no  Pidgin will be installed in /usr/bin. [End of configuration summary.]  The RPMs produced were believable.  The one for Pidgin appeared identical to dimstar's package, no surprise, which means it had no recognizable voice-video configuration plugin.  There is no sign that anything video-ish was compiled.    I did: grep -r -l -i farstream .  There were 163 hits.  All the makefiles define FARSTREAM_CFLAGS and FARSTREAM_LIBS (useless).  Libpurple seems to depend on libfarstream-0.2.so but the code that uses it is not obvious.  ./libpurple/mediamanager.c and ./libpurple/media/backend-fs2.c can #include farstream.h or farsight.h according to HAVE_FARSIGHT (which is back-version for us), but I don't see where the included declarations are used.    I'm coming to the conclusion that the voice-video plugin would have been built if present, but it is not present in this source package.  Sigh.  So why does my experience differ from that in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=853038#c7) by Rafal Milecki (2014-03-03)?
