```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - Use-after-free in the filesystem API.
  - Out-of-bounds read issues in the SPDY protocol implementation.
  - Buffer overflow issue in bitmap handling in the clipboard implementation.
  - Heap-based buffer overflow issue in chromium's ffmpeg media filter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Use-after-free
  - Out-of-bounds read
  - Buffer overflow
  - Heap overflow
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition
- Attack vectors:
  - Remote attacker
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities.
