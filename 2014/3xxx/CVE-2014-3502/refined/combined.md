Apache Cordova Android 3.5.1
By:
[Marcel Kinard](https://twitter.com/MarcelKinard)

04 Aug 2014

**Updated: 2014-08-06**
(The text of CVE-2014-3502 was changed after this post was released, to better explain the cope of the issue and the ways to mitigate the problem)

Security issues were discovered in the Android platform of Cordova. We are releasing version 3.5.1 of Cordova Android to address these security issues. We recommend that all Android applications built using Cordova be upgraded to use version 3.5.1 of Cordova Android. Other Cordova platforms such as iOS are unaffected, and do not have an update.

When using the Cordova CLI, the command to use 3.5.1 of Cordova Android is:

```
cordova platform add android@3.5.1 --usenpm

```

The security issues are CVE-2014-3500, CVE-2014-3501, and CVE-2014-3502.

For your convenience, the text of these CVEs is included here.

CVE-2014-3500: Cordova cross-application scripting via Android intent URLs

Severity: High

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android versions up to 3.5.0

Description:
Android applications built with the Cordova framework can be launched through
a special intent URL. A specially-crafted URL could cause the Cordova-based
application to start up with a different start page than the developer
intended, including other HTML content stored on the Android device. This has
been the case in all released versions of Cordova up to 3.5.0, and has been
fixed in the latest release (3.5.1). We recommend affected projects update
their applications to the latest release.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with
Cordova Android 3.5.1.

CVE-2014-3501: Cordova whitelist bypass for non-HTTP URLs

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
All released Cordova Android versions

Description:
Android applications built with the Cordova framework use a WebView component
to display content. Cordova applications can specify a whitelist of URLs which
the application will be allowed to display, or to communicate with via
XMLHttpRequest. This whitelist, however, is not used by the WebView component
when it is directed via JavaScript to communicate over non-http channels.

Specifically, it can be possible to open a WebSocket connection from the
application JavaScript which will connect to any reachable server on the
Internet. If an attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the
application, then that attacker can cause a connection to be opened to any
server, bypassing the HTTP whitelist.

This is a limitation of the hybrid app architecture on Android in general, and
not specific to Apache Cordova.

It is possible to mitigate this attack vector by adding a CSP meta tag to all
HTML pages in the application, to allow connections only to trusted sources.
App developers should also upgrade to Cordova Android 3.5.1, to reduce the risk
of XAS attacks against their applications, which could then use this mechanism
to reach unintended servers. See CVE-2014-3500 for more information on a
possible XAS vulnerability.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with
Cordova Android 3.5.1, and consider adding CSP meta tags to their application
HTML.

CVE-2014-3502: Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via URL
loading

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android versions up to 3.5.0

Description:
Android applications built with the Cordova framework can launch other
applications through the use of anchor tags, or by redirecting the webview to
an Android intent URL. An attacker who can manipulate the HTML content of a
Cordova application can create links which open other applications and send
arbitrary data to those applications. An attacker who can run arbitrary
JavaScript code within the context of the Cordova application can also set the
document location to such a URL. By using this in concert with a second,
vulnerable application, an attacker might be able to use this method to send
data from the Cordova application to the network.

The latest release of Cordova Android takes steps to block explicit Android
intent urls, so that they can no longer be used to start arbitrary applications
on the device.

Implicit intents, including URLs with schemes such as "tel", "geo", and "sms"
can still be used to open external applications by default, but this behaviour
can be overridden by plugins.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with
Cordova Android 3.5.1.

Apache Cordova Android 3.5.1 Update
By:
[Ian Clelland](https://twitter.com/iclelland)

06 Aug 2014

On Monday, we released Cordova Android 3.5.1, to address a couple of security issues. Afterwards, talking with the original researchers, we realized that the text of the security announcement that went out wasn't quite right, so we've amended it.

You can read the amended blog post [here](http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2014/08/04/android-351.html).

The issue in CVE-2014-3502 is that Cordova applications would, by default, pass any URLs that they couldn't load to the Android intent system for handling. This lets developers construct URLs that open email applications, maps, or send SMS messages, or even open web pages in the system browser, but it also allowed malicious URLs that could potentially open other applications on the device. This meant that if someone could execute their own JavaScript in your application, that they could use other applications on the device to "phone home" with the user's data. This is why we are recommending that all Android developers upgrade to Cordova 3.5.1.

In order not to break existing applications, Cordova 3.5.1 disallows clearly malicious URLs, but will still open links like `sms:`, `mailto:`, or `geo:` in their default applications. (It is, after all, a useful feature, and there are many published applications which rely on that behaviour.) If you want to restrict that even further, you can use Cordova plugins to customize which URLs can be loaded, and which URLs will be blocked completely.

As a very simple example of this, I have published a sample plugin which blocks all external applications from loading. To use it, install it like

```
cordova plugin add net.iclelland.external-app-block

```

or feel free to clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/clelland/cordova-plugin-external-app-block) and tweak it to suit your needs.

We're hoping to have a more flexible solution built in to Cordova with the next release, but in the meantime, the plugin system is powerful enough to allow you to control this for your apps yourself.
