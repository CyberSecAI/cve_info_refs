## (0Day) Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for TSM userRequest save\_server\_groups Command Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-14-166ZDI-CAN-2247

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-3914](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-3914) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Rocket Software](http://www.rocketsoftware.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Rocket Servergraph](http://www.rocketsoftware.com/products/rocket-servergraph-professional) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['13846']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the userRequest servlet. This servlet is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing save\_server\_groups commands. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.  Vendor Contact Timeline:04/16/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact04/16/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/12/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact05/12/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/05/2014 - ZDI telephoned vendor's support line and were told we would receive a callback (no callback)05/19/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact05/19/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/21/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact and indicated final attempt/intent to move toward 0-day06/02/2014 - Public release of advisory  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Advisory Details

June 2nd, 2014
## (0Day) Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for TSM fileRequestorServlet run/runClear Command Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-14-162ZDI-CAN-2262

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-3914](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-3914) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Rocket Software](http://www.rocketsoftware.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Rocket Servergraph](http://www.rocketsoftware.com/products/rocket-servergraph-professional) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['13853']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the fileRequestServlet servlet. This servlet is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing run and runClear commands. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.  Vendor Contact Timeline:04/16/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact04/16/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/12/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact05/12/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/05/2014 - ZDI telephoned vendor's support line and were told we would receive a callback (no callback)05/19/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact05/19/2014 - Automated reply from vendor05/21/2014 - ZDI emailed the vendor's support requesting contact and indicated final attempt/intent to move toward 0-day06/02/2014 - Public release of advisory  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2014-04-16 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2014-06-02 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
