    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem on s390 architecture did not properly sanitize the address-space-control bits when the program-status word (PSW) was being set via a `PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA` request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sanitization of the PSW mask value.",
      "Lack of proper restriction on address-space control operations in ptrace requests."
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could gain read and write access to kernel memory, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user crafts a malicious application that makes a ptrace system call with `PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA`.",
      "The malicious application sets the address-space-control bits in the PSW mask to kernel space."

    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code locally on a vulnerable s390 system.",
      "Ability to make ptrace system calls."
     ],
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is specific to the s390 architecture. The `PSW_MASK_USER` define included the `PSW_MASK_ASC` bits, but the ptrace interface did not properly reject the address-space-control bit combination for the home space, allowing for kernel memory access."
