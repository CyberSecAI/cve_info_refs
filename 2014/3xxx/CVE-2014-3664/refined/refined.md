  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw in Jenkins. This allows users with Overall/READ permission to access arbitrary files in the filesystem that Jenkins can read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
       "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information, such as encryption keys and other potentially sensitive files readable by the Jenkins process.",
