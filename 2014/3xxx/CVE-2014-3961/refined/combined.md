Yarubo #1: Arbitrary SQL Execution in Participants Database for Wordpress
=========================================================================

Program: Participants Database <= 1.5.4.8
Severity: Unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the Wordpress
installation
Permalink: <http://www.yarubo.com/advisories/1>

— Info —

Participants Database is a popular Wordpress plugin that offers the
functionality needed to build and maintain a database of people. As of
today the plugin has been downloaded 92,089 times.

— Vulnerability details —

1. Due to insufficient privilege checks it is possible for anonymous
(unauthenticated) users to trigger some administrative actions If any of
the shortcodes is used (e.g. signup page).

2. The action "export CSV" takes a parameter called "query" that can
contain an arbitrary SQL query. This means that an unauthenticated user can
execute arbitrary SQL statements (e.g. create an admin user, read or write
files, or execute code depending on the MySQL user privileges).

— Exploit —

Add a user to wordpress as follows (if you want an admin user, also add
admin privileges to wp_usermeta):

POST /wordpress/pdb-signup/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Length: 789
(…)
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;
boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryuoACADe1C2IFWMxN

## Description

This plugin offers all the functionality needed to build and maintain a database of people or anything you want. The database is fully configurable, allowing you to define all the fields of information you want to store for each record. The records can be entered individually in the WordPress admin section, imported with a CSV file, or let the individuals themselves create their own record. Display lists of records can be sorted and filtered by any field, and the result exported as a CSV file.

This plugin was developed for an organization with the mission of educating and empowering voters. This organization needed to quickly build a database of concerned voters, supporters, and volunteers, giving them an ability to collect input and feedback, organize volunteers, and mobilize its voter constituency with actions such as petition drives and voter education campaigns.

This database could be of use to any organization that needs to build and maintain lists of constituents, supporters, members, volunteers, etc. for any purpose. It is designed to be easy to use and serve multiple purposes, with several very powerful features to customize its functionality to the needs of your organization, club, sports team, or any other large group of people.

The plugin can be easily adapted to work as a database for other applications such as indexes, directories, catalogs, or anything, really. The plugin uses a system of customizable templates for all its displays, and an API for the customization and extension of its capabilities. The plugin is fully internationalized with a growing set of translations.

#### Database

The heart of this plugin is the participants database, which is completely configurable. It comes pre-filled with standard fields such as name, address, phone, etc., but you can define any fields you want, including the type of field, validation, help text and a print title for each field. Fields are also organized into groups so large amounts of information can be better managed, and long forms broken up into logical sections.

Fields can be defined as text-lines, text-areas, rich text (with a rich-text editor), single and multiple-select dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons or image uploads. Each field has its own validation which can be required, not required, or validated with a regular expression.

#### Sign Up Form

The plugin provides a shortcode for a sign-up form that presents a customizable subset of the fields for a quick signup. For example, your signup form could ask only for a name and email address, creating an easy point-of-entry for new members, supporters or volunteers. The signup can generate two emails: one to an administrator to notify them of the signup, and also to the person signing up. Their email can contain a link to their full record, which they can return and fill out at their leisure. This full form (which is placed on the website with another shortcode) can include any information you want to collect from your signups.

Signup forms are produced by a template, making it easy to add extra functionality and match the presentation of the form to your theme.

#### Frontend Record Edit Form

This is where people who have signed up can fill in any additional information about themselves you wish to collect. It can be additional demographic info, survey questions, what they would be willing to offer in support. This form is accessible to the signups via an individual link containing an ID number, which is emailed to them when they sign up. They don’t need to register as a user or enter a password, they just need the link.

#### Backend Record Editing

For your backend users, the ability to edit and enter new records is provided. This backend form can also contain administrative fields that won’t be visible to the front-end (not logged-in) user, so organization staff can keep internal records of volunteer activities, availability, contributions, personal notes, etc.

The backend form is set up for rapid manual entry of multiple records, such as after a signup drive, doorbelling, or public event.

For textarea fields, a rich-text editor will be used if enabled in the settings.

#### List Display

Display the list on your website with the `[pdb_list]` shortcode. You can determine which fields get shown, and for long lists, the list can be broken up into pages. You can specify which records get displayed and in what order. Optionally, search and sorting controls can be displayed. Each record listing can be linked to the full record showing all the details of the record.

#### Record Display

Each individual record can be displayed using a shortcode and accessed by the ID if the record. A template file formats the output of the shortcode. A plugin setting determines how a link to the individual record may be placed on the list of records.

#### Import/Export Records

All records can be exported as a CSV-formatted text file that can be read by spreadsheet applications and used for mass email campaigns, hard-copy lists, and other applications. The records exported can be filtered by column values: for instance, only people who have consented to receive a newsletter will be included. Records may also be sorted by any column. Which fields are included in the export/import is determined by the “CSV” column of the field definition.

Records can also be mass-imported with a CSV file, allowing you to use existing lists from spreadsheets, or for offline compilation of records using a spreadsheet such as Libre Office or Google Docs. A blank spreadsheet can be exported from the plugin to get people started in entering records offline.

#### Internationalization and Translations

This plugin is fully compliant with WordPress Internationalization standards and includes several translations, some of which are incomplete at the moment. All of the front-end text is user-customizable, so even if a translation isn’t available for your language, your users will be able to use the plugin in their language.

## FAQ

### How do I get the form to display? Where does the shortcode go?

Put the `[pdb_signup]` shortcode where you want your signup form to go.

### I can’t find the shortcode. Where is it?

A shortcode is a WordPress feature that lets you insert plugin content into your posts and pages. It is just a special bit of text that is replaced with the plugin content when the page or post is viewed. Just put this: `[pdb_signup]` into your page, and when you view the page, the signup form will be displayed.

### What happens when someone signs up?

Their record is added to the database with the information provided in the signup form. Also, two emails will be sent (if you want) one to the admin to notify them of the signup, and also to the user to tell them they’ve signed up and also give them a private link to their record edit page so they can update or add to their record.

### What do you mean by a users record edit page?

This form appears on the page where you have placed the `[pdb_record]` shortcode. It is another form where the record can be edited on the frontend.

An individual record can be edited on the frontend of your website by someone who has the private link to that record. The purpose here is to let people maintain their own records. It’s also possible to put things like survey questions in the form so you can get feedback from people. You have complete control over what fields appear on this form. Fields can be designated as showing up on the signup form, on the frontend user’s form, and on the backend admin form.

### The email goes out to the person when they register, but the “edit link” is blank

This means your “Participant Record Page” is not configured. First, you need a page for the record edit form. On that page, place the [pdb\_record] shortcode. Then, look under the “Record Form” tab in the plugin settings, make sure the page where you have the [pdb\_record] shortcode is selected in the Participant Record Page setting.

### How do I delete all the records but leave everything else in place?

The best way to do this is to perform a “truncate” on the table. You’ll need to get direct access to the database to do this, usually using phpMyAdmin, which is typically found in your hosting control panel. Open the database and find the main participants database table…usually called “wp\_participants\_database”. Perform a truncate on that table only. The truncate command is found by selecting the table, then under the “operations” tab in the lower right.

### What if I just want them to sign up and fill out all their info at that point?

OK, just assign all the fields you want them to fill out to the signup form (this is done in the “manage fields” page). That form can be as big as you want. Then, remove the private link from the email they get when they sign up.

### How do I change the text “Participant Info” seen at the top of the single record page?

This is a group title. Groups are defined on the Manage Database Fields page under the “Field Groups” tab. You will see that each group has a title and a description that you can use to organize and label the ouput of the plugin.

### How do I let people upload an image or file?

Go to the “manage database fields” page and create a new field for your image. Give it a descriptive name like “avatar” or something. Click “add field” and when your new field appears, set the “field type” to “image upload” for images and “file-upload” for other types of file. Be sure to check “signup” if you want it to appear in the signup form. When the form is presented to the user, they will be allowed to upload an image.

There are several settings you should look at before you go live with your uploads fields. Under the “General Settings” tab, you’ll find:

\* File Upload Location – this tells the plugin where to put the uploaded files

\* File Upload Limit – this is the size limit in Kilobytes for your file uploads. Be careful not to put this too high, if you have lots of users, it could use a lot of space on your server!

\* Allowed File Types – this is a comma-separated list of allowed file extensions. You can also define this on a per-field basis.

\* Allow File Delete – if this is checked, the file will be removed from the server when a user deletes it.

Each file upload field can have its allowed files determined in the “values” field on the Manage Database Fields page. For instance, if you want them to upload only a pdf file, put “pdf” in the values field for that field. The maximum size is determined globally in the settings only.

### When someone signs up, are they now users on my WordPress site?

No, these signups and records are separate from people who can register on your site as users. If there are things only registered users can do (such as a forum or comments), they will have to register or sign in as usual.

The idea is to use the database as a roster of volunteers, supporters, etc. for the organization, not the website.

If you are interested in having this plugin work with WordPress users, read this article: [Using Participants Database with WordPress Users](http://xnau.com/using-participants-database-with-wordpress-users/).

### People are signing up, but emails are not getting sent

Use my [Email Troubleshooting Flowchart](http://xnau.com/participants-database-email-troubleshooting/) to help you diagnose the problem.

Of course make sure your settings are set to send emails.

The most common reason emails are not being sent is because the WP application cannot send email. If you are having this problem, I suggest you install an SMTP plugin (like WP-Mail-SMTP) and use that plugin to test your email sending. Sometimes it is necessary to set up and use SMTP (which is not the default on most systems) to successfully send email.

Another common source of email trouble is other plugins that send email. It is not uncommon for such plugins to “hijack” the WP mail function and this can break it for other plugins. Try turning off other plugins that send email to see who the troublemaker is.

Finally, your emails may be getting caught in spam filters. If you find the plugin’s emails in the spam folder, using a “from” email from the same domain as the site can help. If you are using HTML email (the default) keep it short and don’t include lots of links, images or spammy words.

### I don’t see anything on the page where I put the `[pdb\_record]` shortcode. What’s up?

The form will only appear if someone uses a valid private link to access the page. All that’s required for a private link is a valid “pid” value has to be included in the URI. (it looks like “pid=TH65J” in the link) This code can be seen in the record if you want to make your own links.

### I don’t want Administrative Fields showing up on the user’s edit record page. How do I control that?

You can control which groups of fields show up in the frontend record edit screen (the one with the `[pdb_record]` shortcode) by going to the “manage database fields” page, clicking on the “field groups” tab and deselecting the “display” checkbox for those field groups you don’t want shown on the frontend.

### I want people to provide their email when they sign up, but I don’t want that information showing to the public

It’s a good practice to use field groups for something like this. Place all your “don’t show to the public” fields in a group with its “display” checkbox unchecked. This will prevent those fields from being shown in record detail pages, and also the signup form, but you can force them to display by specifying in the shortcode which groups you want included. The normally hidden groups will be included, but only those fields marked with the “signup” checkbox will appear.

For example, let’s say you have two groups: ‘public’ and ‘private.’ The email field is in the private group because you don’t want it displayed. In the signup form shortcode, specify the groups to show like this: `[pdb_signup groups=public,private]` Now, both groups will be included in the signup form. Remember, only those fields marked as “signup” fields will be shown.

### I don’t want group titles showing in the forms, how do I do that?

The easiest way to do this is to simply blank out the title for the group.

### What if someone loses their private link?

You can show a “Resend Private Link” link on your signup form, just check “Enable Lost Private Link” under the “Retrieve Link Settings” tab. You must define which field is used to identify the record. This must be a unique identifier, usually an email address, but it could be anything. The rest of the settings for this feature are under that tab.

It’s also possible to send them the link again in an email, but the plugin does not currently provide a way to do this. You will have to sent them a link to the edit record page (the one with the `[pdb_record]` shortcode), adding their code at the end of the link like this: ?pid=RH45L (using whatever the code for their record is.) The code is visible when you view the record from the “list participants” page.

### Is it possible for users to upload files?

File uploads use the “file upload” field type. You should define a set of allowed file extensions in the settings: “allowed file types” under the “general settings” tab.

### My site is not in English and searches using non-English characters are not working properly.

If you have a non-English site, you should convert your database to the correct “collation” for your language.

### I’m seeing strange characters in my CSV export. What’s going on?

The plugin exports its CSV files in “UTF-8” format. Make sure the program you’re using to read the file knows this…it should detect it automatically, but can fail under some circumstances. Often this can be set on the import screen of the spreadsheet program when you open the CSV.

### Is the private link to an individual record secure?

It is what I would call “reasonably secure” in other words, the private code in the link is not easily guessed. It can be sent in an email, which is not secure, but emails getting compromised is not that much a risk for most of us. The level of security is reasonable for the kind of information it is designed to store.

Therefore, this plugin is *absolutely not* for the storage of any kind of information requiring good security such as credit card numbers, passwords, social security numbers, etc. And I certainly couldn’t be held liable if someone were to irresponsibly use the plugin for such a purpose.

### Can I make links in records clickable?

Yes, there is a plugin setting called “Make Links Clickable” that scans the fields looking for something that starts with “http” it will then wrap that in a link tag so it will be clickable. It will also render email addresses clickable.

There is also a form field type called “link” that lets people fill in a URL and also give it a text label such as “My Website” that will click to the URL.

### Is a CAPTCHA available for the forms?

You can define a “captcha” form element which will show a simple math question for the user to answer.

We needed a plugin to help us create a searchable database for a ‘hall of fame.’ This plugin allows upload of the information and easy modification of sort order and search capabilities. We are really happy with it.
We found it easy to install, use and configure and no one here is a programmer (as with most things, it helps to read the documentation). This free plugin has been a lifesaver. Recommend.

After a lot of research, finding the most simple plugin to maintain a membership list of our graduating class and enabling each member to update his/her record – this was the best solution. Even better than expensive WPForms for a similar solution.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Yarubo #1: Arbitrary SQL Execution in Participants Database for Wordpress
=========================================================================

Program: Participants Database <= 1.5.4.8
Severity: Unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the Wordpress
installation
Permalink: http://www.yarubo.com/advisories/1

— Info —

Participants Database is a popular Wordpress plugin that offers the
functionality needed to build and maintain a database of people. As of
today the plugin has been downloaded 92,089 times.

— Vulnerability details —

1. Due to insufficient privilege checks it is possible for anonymous
(unauthenticated) users to trigger some administrative actions If any of
the shortcodes is used (e.g. signup page).

2. The action "export CSV" takes a parameter called "query" that can
contain an arbitrary SQL query. This means that an unauthenticated user can
execute arbitrary SQL statements (e.g. create an admin user, read or write
files, or execute code depending on the MySQL user privileges).

— Exploit —

Add a user to wordpress as follows (if you want an admin user, also add
admin privileges to wp_usermeta):

POST /wordpress/pdb-signup/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Length: 789

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
