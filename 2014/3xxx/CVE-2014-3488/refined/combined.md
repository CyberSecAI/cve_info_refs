Package        : netty-3.9
Version        : 3.9.0.Final-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0193 CVE-2014-3488 CVE-2019-16869 CVE-2019-20444
                 CVE-2019-20445 CVE-2020-7238
Debian Bug     : 746639 941266 950966 950967

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Netty, a Java NIO
client/server socket framework:

CVE-2014-0193

    WebSocket08FrameDecoder allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory consumption) via a TextWebSocketFrame followed
    by a long stream of ContinuationWebSocketFrames.

CVE-2014-3488

    The SslHandler allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted
    SSLv2Hello message.

CVE-2019-16869

    Netty mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers (such
    as a "Transfer-Encoding : chunked" line), which leads to HTTP
    request smuggling.

CVE-2019-20444

    HttpObjectDecoder.java allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon,
    which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect
    syntax, or might be interpreted as an "invalid fold."

CVE-2019-20445

    HttpObjectDecoder.java allows a Content-Length header to be
    accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a
    Transfer-Encoding header.

CVE-2020-7238

    Netty allows HTTP Request Smuggling because it mishandles
    Transfer-Encoding whitespace (such as a
    [space]Transfer-Encoding:chunked line) and a later Content-Length
    header.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.9.0.Final-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your netty-3.9 packages.

Fix a bug where SslHandler does not handle SSLv2Hello correctly

[Browse files](/netty/netty/tree/2fa9400a59d0563a66908aba55c41e7285a04994)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
Motivation:

When a SSLv2Hello message is received, SSLEngine expects the application buffer size to be more than 30KB which is larger than what SslBufferPool can provide.  SSLEngine will always return with BUFFER_OVERFLOW status, blocking the SSL session from continuing the handshake.

Modifications:

When SSLEngine.getSession().getApplicationBufferSize() returns a value larger than what SslBufferPool provides, allocate a temporary heap buffer.

Result:

SSLv2Hello is handled correctly.
```

## Description

[![@normanmaurer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439362?u=b3c450ca477263b3a6fdae6fccb7b6163120ca96&v=4&size=48)](/normanmaurer)[normanmaurer](https://github.com/normanmaurer)opened [on Jun 11, 2014](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2562#issue-35466772)

It was discovered that when handling specifically crafted SSL packets, the SslHandler implementation in Netty entered an infinite loop. An unauthenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service by CPU exhaustion.

# Netty 3.9.2.Final released

by
[normanmaurer](https://github.com/normanmaurer)

on
11-Jun-2014

Today we are happy to announce the release of Netty 3.9.2.Final. This is an important release if you use a previous version of the 3.9 branch because it fixes a possible DoS attack
when using the SslHandler. So please upgrade as soon as possible. For the security bug CVE-2014-3488 was assigned.

Beside the security fix this release also allows to use our own OpenSSLEngine which uses OpenSSL for maximal performance and low latency.

## Most important changes / fixes

* Possible DoS by CPU exhaustion when using malicious SSL packets ([#2562](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2562))
* Add OpenSslEngine ([#2464](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2464))
* Provide universal API to create an SSLEngine ([#2499](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2499))
* Minimize memory footprint of HashedWheelTimer and context-switching ([#2453](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2453))

Visit [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A3.9.2.Final) for the complete list of the changes.

As always please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
