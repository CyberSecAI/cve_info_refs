Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a vulnerability in the Livebox 1.1 router's web administration panel, specifically an unprotected configuration file upload feature. This feature, intended for legitimate configuration changes, can be accessed through a hidden page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hidden Web Page Access:** The administration panel contains hidden pages, including one that allows uploading a configuration file.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The configuration upload page is not adequately protected, and access can be granted using a simple javascript code.
*  **Configuration File Exposure:** The configuration file contains sensitive information like xADSL username and password, root password, and the administration panel hash.
* **Javascript Injection:**  The provided javascript snippet `JavaScript:mimic_button('navigator:_70..')` can be used to grant access to the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as the xADSL username and password, root password, and the administration panel's password hash.
*   **Full Device Control:** The root password gives full control over the device.
*   **Configuration Modification:** By uploading a malicious configuration file, an attacker could manipulate the deviceâ€™s behavior.
*   **Information Leakage:**  The attacker can also download the current config file and get all the information within it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector is through the router's web interface, specifically by accessing the hidden configuration upload page.
*   **Javascript injection:**  Exploitation can be achieved by injecting a malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface, either through the local network or potentially remotely if the web interface is exposed to the internet.
*   **Basic Understanding of Javascript:** The attacker needs to understand how to execute javascript code to grant access to the vulnerable page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing specific technical details about the vulnerability.
*   The information is from 2014 and refers to specific firmware and hardware versions (Livebox 1.1, Firmware 26014A).

This information is relevant to CVE-2014-3150 as it describes a vulnerability involving unauthorized access and configuration manipulation of a router through its web interface, a common target for such CVEs.
