How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Subversion, Serf: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201610-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Subversion and Serf,
the worst of which could lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-vcs/subversion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.4**revision > **1.8.16** |

| Package | **net-libs/serf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.7** |

### Background

Subversion is a version control system intended to eventually replace
CVS. Like CVS, it has an optional client-server architecture (where the
server can be an Apache server running mod\_svn, or an ssh program as in
CVS’s :ext: method). In addition to supporting the features found in
CVS, Subversion also provides support for moving and copying files and
directories.

The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Subversion and Serf.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, obtain
sensitive information, or cause a Denial of Service Condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-vcs/subversion-1.9.4"

```

All Serf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/serf-1.3.7"

```

 Subversion's Serf RA layer does not correctly validate certificates
with wildcards in them for HTTPS.
Summary:
========
Subversion's Serf RA layer improperly evaluates wildcards for HTTPS. This
means it will accept certificates that it should not accept as matching the
hostname the client is using to make the request.
This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack. There are no known instances
of this problem being exploited in the wild and in practice it should be
difficult to actually exploit this vulnerability.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion clients using Serf 1.4.0 through 1.7.17 (inclusive)
Subversion clients using Serf 1.8.0 through 1.8.9 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.7.18
Subversion 1.8.10
Subversion clients not using HTTPS or using Neon.
Details:
========
Using the Serf RA layer of Subversion for HTTPS uses the apr\_fnmatch
API to handle matching wildcards in certificate Common Names and Subject
Alternate Names. However, apr\_fnmatch is not designed for this purpose.
Instead it is designed to behave like common shell globbing. In particular
this means that '\*' is not limited to a single label within a hostname (i.e.
it will match '.'). But even further apr\_fnmatch supports '?' and character
classes (neither of which are part of the RFCs defining how certificate
validation works).
For HTTPS URLs Subversion has historically been able to use one of two
HTTP libraries, Serf or Neon. Serf support was first added as a build time
option in Subversion 1.4.0, which meant only Serf or Neon was available in
a given build of Subversion. Starting with 1.5.0 Subversion supported
building support for both Serf and Neon and choosing which one to use based
on a run-time configuration option. Subversion 1.8.0 removed support for
Neon. Clients using Neon are not vulnerable to this issue, since the Neon
library itself implements the name validation and does so correctly.
Users can see if their client supports serf by running `svn --version` and
looking to see if the ra\_serf repository access module is available.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.0
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N
We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Taking advantage of
this vulnerability to execute a man in the middle attack requires access
to the network or DNS of the client in order to redirect it to the attackers
server. Additionally, the attacker needs a certificate signed by an
issuer that the client trusts.
The most concerning aspect of this vulnerability is the '\*' wildcard
matching across hostname labels. This for instance could allow a
certificate with the Common Name set to only "\*" to be matched against
any hostname. Another possibility would be for an attacker to try and
get a certificate signed for a domain they control that is a suffix for
the domain they wish to attack. For example if attacking "example.com"
the attacker could try registering "ample.com" and then request a
certificate for "\*ample.com" (note the lack of a '.' between the '\*' and
'a'). However, issuers should not be signing such certificates.
This issue when combined with the Serf vulnerability CVE-2014-3504, does
however, make things slightly worse. CVE-2014-3504 means that serf does
not properly handle certificates with embedded NUL bytes in their Common
Names or Subject Alternate Names. So an attacker could request a
certificate with the Common Name of "\*\0.example.com" where "\0" is
a NUL byte and ".example.com" is a domain the attacker owns. Such a
certificate would be matched for any hostname. Again issuers should not
be signing such certificates.
There is of course no requirement that the attacker use certificates
signed by a Certifying Authority. However, if an end user is going to accept
the certificate (without fingerprint verification) despite an error telling
them it is not certified by a trusted authority then this vulnerability is
not needed to man-in-the-middle that user. Since the attacker can simply
generate a certificate with the expected values. As such, useful exploitation
of this vulnerability comes from getting a trusted Certifying Authority to
sign a certificate the client will accept.
A successful man-in-the-middle attack would give the attacker access to
the plaintext of the encrypted communications between the client and the
server. This would expose any information from the repository the client
has requested. It may expose authentication credentials which can be used
by the attacker to impersonate the user of the attacked client and thus
gain access to more information or even be able to modify the repository.
In all cases the attacker would still be subject to any authorization rules
configured on the repository.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.10. Users of
Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
included patch. We also recommend that all users upgrade to Serf 1.3.7
or newer to resolve CVE-2014-3504.
New Subversion packages can be found at:
http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
There are no workarounds available. However, some of the risk can be
mitigated by users taking some care. Users should not accept certificates
that are not signed by a trusted certifying authority, without verifying
their authenticity via the fingerprint. Users may also configure their
clients not to trust certifying authorities (or decrease the number of
certifying authorities they trust). Unfortunately, these mitigating steps
require a great deal of care on the part of users, so upgrading the client
immediately is the best course of action.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2316-1: Subversion vulnerabilities

14 August 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Subversion.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [subversion](/security/cves?package=subversion) - Advanced version control system

## Details

Lieven Govaerts discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module

incorrectly handled certain request methods when SVNListParentPath was

enabled. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0032](/security/CVE-2014-0032))

Ben Reser discovered that Subversion did not correctly validate SSL

certificates containing wildcards. A remote attacker could exploit this to

perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. ([CVE-2014-3522](/security/CVE-2014-3522))

Bert Huijben discovered that Subversion did not properly handle cached

credentials. A malicious server could possibly use this issue to obtain

credentials cached for a different server. ([CVE-2014-3528](/security/CVE-2014-3528))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libsvn1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1)
* [subversion](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.8.8-1ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libapache2-svn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)
* [libsvn1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)
* [subversion](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion)
  -
  [1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/subversion/1.6.17dfsg-3ubuntu3.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
