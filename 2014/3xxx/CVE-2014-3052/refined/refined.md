- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfiguration in IBM Security Access Manager (ISAM) for Web v8.0 could cause systems to fail to properly comply with NIST800-131 standards.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper configuration of the "jct-nist-compliance" parameter when using SSL connections to a backend application compliant with NIST800-131a.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Failure to comply with NIST800-131 standards.
- **Attack vectors:** Configuring an ISAM reverse proxy component to use an SSL connection to a protected backend application compliant with NIST800-131a without correctly setting the "jct-nist-compliance" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to configure the ISAM reverse proxy.
