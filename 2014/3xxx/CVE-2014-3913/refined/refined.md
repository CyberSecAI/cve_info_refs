Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in Ericom AccessNow Server.
- The root cause is an insecure usage of `vsprintf` with user-controlled data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `AccessServer32.exe` application does not perform sufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data when handling requests for non-existent files, leading to stack corruption.
- **Insecure Use of `vsprintf`:** The `vsprintf` function is used without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **SYSTEM Privileges:** The attacker can achieve code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the server.
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability Details:** The attacker needs to know the specific structure of the malformed HTTP request to trigger the overflow and control the execution flow

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory from Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) mentions that the vulnerability was disclosed publicly without a patch due to lack of vendor response. However, the vendor did eventually issue a patch.
- The metasploit module was tested on Ericom AccessNow Server 2.4.0.2 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 Server SP2.
- The exploit uses a ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) chain to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and execute the payload.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifying the vulnerable function (`vsprintf`), the affected executable (`AccessServer32.exe`) and the method of exploitation (malformed HTTP request).
