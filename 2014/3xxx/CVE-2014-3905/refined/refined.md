Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Shutter web package. This vulnerability is exploitable through a SQL injection vulnerability (JVN#48039501).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the application.
*   **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability is also listed as exploitable via a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** If an administrator views a malicious page while logged in, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the administrator's web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities including session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks on the system and network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **Malicious Page:** The attack is carried out by having an administrator view a maliciously crafted web page.
*   **SQL Injection:** The XSS is reachable by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability, suggesting that the attacker can insert malicious data through this injection point which leads to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to target the vulnerable application.
*   **Administrator Target:** The attack requires tricking a logged in administrator to view the malicious page.
*   **Ability to exploit SQL injection:** To successfully exploit the XSS vulnerability, the attacker needs to exploit an existing SQL injection vulnerability first.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The software is no longer maintained, so no patch or update is available.
*   The recommended solution is to uninstall the software.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 2.6, indicating a low severity due to the high complexity and limited impact.
* The vulnerability was reported by Yuji Tounai of bogus.jp to IPA.
