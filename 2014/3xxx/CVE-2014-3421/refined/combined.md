The following bug was recently filed against the emacs23 package, and
after some preliminary research, it appears that the security issues
mentioned may still apply to 24.3.  (Though it looks like the relevant
tramp file may now be tramp-sh.el).

OK. For the record I don't think any of these issues are anything but
trivial in practice, except possibly the tramp one.

find-gc.el looked completely broken, I doubt anyone had used it in ~ a
decade.

I see they still want us to do something about the Mosaic one, sigh.
So I will do something for that. Someone would have to actively
configure their system to use mosaic, or have no other browser program
installed except xmosaic, for this to even potentially be an issue.

I see Mosaic got some CVEs out of this too. :)

The gnus-fun one is some obscure thing to do with xawtv. Again I guess
it doesn't have (m)any users, or doesn't even work any more, since it
relies on files /tftpboot/sparky/tmp/snap.*ppm existing.

But yes, they should all be fixed.

I think this handles the Mosaic one:

Subject: Re: CVE Request - Predictable temporary filenames in GNU Emacs

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=17428#8>

The reports are about unrelated Emacs Lisp files that are bundled with
GNU Emacs. In situations such as this, the various files with
vulnerable code were, almost certainly, first introduced in different
GNU Emacs versions. Thus, the issues in each file have separate CVE
IDs based on the different earliest version of GNU Emacs that is
affected. We don't necessarily provide details of what these versions
are as part of the CVE assignment process or even the CVE publication
process. However, for example,
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/emacs/emacs/lisp/gnus/gnus-fun.el>
says "file gnus-fun.el was initially added on branch gnus-5_10-branch"
suggesting early 2000s, whereas the Mosaic support in browse-url.el is
obviously from the 1990s.

All of the files allow symlink attacks, and that is the scope of each
Emacs CVE assignment. If anyone was interested in CVE IDs for
unrelated Emacs vulnerabilities (e.g., if the find-gc.el "horrific
invocations" problem allows injection of commands into csh command
lines), those IDs would need to be assigned separately, even if the
issues were fixed as a side effect of the current patch.

We didn't quite understand the reasoning here. Mosaic reads the
/tmp/Mosaic.##### file. This doesn't seem to imply that Emacs is
entitled to write "newwin" and "goto" records into that file without
considering that it might be a symlink. Even if not all symlink
attacks could be prevented, one might want a countermeasure against
the easiest attacks. Alternatively, writing to /tmp/Mosaic.##### could
perhaps just be removed, on the basis that the threat is more
realistic than is actual use of Mosaic. (The threat model is that
someone's home directory has a .mosaicpid file left over from the
1990s, and that PID happens to be in use.)

Use CVE-2014-3423 for the Emacs vulnerability associated with a
symlink attack against a /tmp/Mosaic.##### file (this is similar to
CVE-2008-4994).

CVE IDs for Mosaic are presumably not too useful at this point, but it
seems best to assign the most obvious ones, so that we are not blaming
Emacs for the entirety of the problem. From the Mosaic CHANGES file:

   From 2.0 to 2.1
   Remote control users and script writers take note: control filename
   changed from /tmp/xmosaic.pid to /tmp/Mosaic.pid. This
   is the final such change, forever.

CVE-2014-3425: Mosaic 2.0 allows local users to cause a denial of
service ("remote control" outage) by creating a /tmp/xmosaic.pid file
for every possible PID.

CVE-2014-3426: Mosaic 2.1 allows local users to cause a denial of
service ("remote control" outage) by creating a /tmp/Mosaic.pid file
for every possible PID.

>> lisp/net/tramp.el
>>   The function `tramp-uudecode`, a fallback if a real uudecoding binary
>>  is not present, blindly uses "/tmp/tramp.$PID", truncating and removing
>>  the file.

> <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-diffs/2014-05/msg00060.html>

Use CVE-2014-3424.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c0)  Patricia Fraser    2011-05-19 19:17:45 CEST  ``` THe press@ address should point to the Marketing and Comms team leader (marcomm) is currently one team with two functions). I'm the current leader, hoping that this can be in place before Mageia 1 Release Day to catch press enquiries and to send out release-related informationto wherever we need it sent.  If the press@ address is already delivering to board or council - and they don't want it to change - could there be a communications@ address instead, just for outgoing  comms from Mageia?  At some point we'd like there to be multiple addresses available to the team, but it's kind of small yet. However, if there's a right way (TM) to plan for that, it would be good to know. ```  Patricia Fraser    2011-05-19 19:18:24 CEST   CC: (none) => trish  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c1)  Michael Scherer    2011-05-20 16:26:04 CEST  ``` There is already a press@ alias, and also a mageia-contact@ list ( that is spammed quite often ).  In order to manage this more cleanly, I would need to create a group for communication team in ldap to track leader and members, but for that, I need the member list. In the mean time, you should see with people in the alias ( rda, ennael, colin, wobo and dams ) to manage the change of owner.   Personnaly, I think this should go to someone of the comm team, but in order to not lose mail, especially from press, we should have more than 1 person to answer and read this alias.   Regarding aliases login@mgeia for the team, it is up to the team, the only requests is that 1) people must have a identity account 2) people must be in a group for that  3) aliases should be distributed to people who did work rather than " I am volunteer, ok, here is your aliases", as people using this will be seen as officialy representing the project.  The rest s up to the team. ```  ---   CC: (none) => misc  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c2)  Patricia Fraser    2011-05-20 18:54:05 CEST  ``` okay - passed back to rda (raising this as a bug was his suggestion). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c3)  Michael Scherer    2011-05-20 20:29:40 CEST  ``` Yes, he asked for aliases so I said that a bug should be opened but I didn't understood it was press@ aliases. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c4)  Romain d'Alverny    2011-05-20 22:20:42 CEST  ``` Ok, let's put this in order:   * we need a communication (call it "communication") group/team setup in LDAP  * Patricia is this team's leader  * she needs a trish@mageia.org alias  * she decides who gets into that team - I am not sure there are other than volunteers so far, but that's up to Patricia to name team peers (who would get an alias)  As for the press@ address; I am not sure if we should setup a shared IMAP box or keep it as an alias. If we keep it as such:  * I suggest press@ alias sends to all people in the communication team; objection to that?  * if so, I would like to be in this team as well - and other board members would ask for that as well if they want to follow this alias  * note that this is strictly separate from subscriptions to the marcom mailing-list (mageia-marketing@mageia.org).  mageia-contact@ should be kept as it is for now, that's a separate issue.  As I am not sure anymore whether we should formally separate marketing and communication, I suggest we use this communication group so far, and see later. ```  ---   CC: (none) => rdalverny  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c5)  Romain d'Alverny    2011-05-23 09:49:24 CEST  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c4)) > As for the press@ address [...]  Note that incoming messages into press@ are not necessarily in English, so readers should expect that. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c6)  Michael Scherer    2011-05-23 10:52:40 CEST  ``` For press being sent to all communication team,  wouldn't mean that the communication team will be "small", and kinda restricted like sysadmins ( ie, people we trust ) ?   This is fine by me, but may have side effect ( ie, is the blog a duty of communication team, so should we count blog people as part of this team ? ). If we use communication team to provides access to some part of the system ( like access to blog, to various ublog account, etc ), we may have then to create another subteams and separate thing a little bit more. So here is what I propose to do now  : - I add trish on the alias on ryu for the time being ( we will clean it after the release ) - I create the group in ldap, with trish as owner - I let people in the council have aliases  ( so by side effect, trish will have the aliases )  We ponder on what the communication team manage ( think blog, ublog, and various access, but also if custom software should be needed ) and if additional subgroup are needed, how the team could evolve , etc. ( like communication, communication-press, communication-ublog, communication-blog )  Once the distribution is out and dust settle : - we move people from the alias to the communication team and remove it from zarb.org server to our own - we decide who have a aliases for the team, etc. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c7)  Romain d'Alverny    2011-05-23 11:30:13 CEST  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c6)) > For press being sent to all communication team,  wouldn't mean that the > communication team will be "small", and kinda restricted like sysadmins ( ie, > people we trust ) ?   Why should it be restricted? Press inquiries/info is not/should not be confidential.  Those joining the communication team anyway are to be people we do have a minimum of trust for :-)  > This is fine by me, but may have side effect ( ie, is the blog a duty of > communication team, so should we count blog people as part of this team ? ). If > we use communication team to provides access to some part of the system ( like > access to blog, to various ublog account, etc ), we may have then to create > another subteams and separate thing a little bit more.  So far, I would keep it decoupled, and let people organize themselves.

Now, if there is no issue with that, that's ok for me too.  Regarding the blog/ublog, etc, the issue is the lack of representation in the council, ie for now, they exist outside of the planned structure, and IMHO, that should be addressed sooner or later ( and obviously, that would be later rather than sooner ) ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c9)  Romain d'Alverny    2011-05-23 13:21:46 CEST  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c8)) > I heard story about people in the communication business were quite secretive > of their addressbook, so since the addressbook is basically just a collection > of email/etc, it made sense to me to treat such data as private.

People pinging directly the press@ alias doesn't make them open to alternative topics, furthermore, if ever, most contacts belonging to a "secret personal addressbook" won't be reached through this alias, but in a 1-to-1 discussion.  > Regarding the blog/ublog, etc, the issue is the lack of representation in the > council, ie for now, they exist outside of the planned structure, and IMHO, > that should be addressed sooner or later ( and obviously, that would be later > rather than sooner )  blog/ublog/etc. resorts on the communication team in the end, but this is still mostly managed by founders & board so far. One way or the other, these are in the Council. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c10)  Nicolas Vigier    2011-05-23 13:26:48 CEST  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c8)) >  > Regarding the blog/ublog, etc, the issue is the lack of representation in the > council, ie for now, they exist outside of the planned structure, and IMHO, > that should be addressed sooner or later ( and obviously, that would be later > rather than sooner )  What would the role of blog team ? I think blog can be managed by people from different teams : - sysadmin team: installing blog - web team: customizing blog - i18n: translating posts from english to other languages - communication team: writting blog posts ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c11)  Michael Scherer    2011-05-26 10:23:22 CEST  ``` The role of the blog team would be to have access at the blog, so if everybody is already from another team ( which is not evident now ), then it would be ok for me. ( on a technical point of view, I would also like to have blog plugged to ldap as this would ease the user management, but this is likely not gonna happen soon ).  So I added trishf42@mageia to the alias press@mageia, added the proper config for the @mageia.org aliases,  and created the group with trish and romain as member. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c12)  Marja Van Waes    2011-10-13 19:57:27 CEST  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1345#c11))  .................... >  > So I added trishf42@mageia to the alias press@mageia, added the proper config > for the @mageia.org aliases,  and created the group with trish and romain as > member.
