- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cryptographic implementation flaws in the Pacom GMS systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple cryptographic issues (CWE-310). The specific nature of these flaws is not detailed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A perpetrator can take control over the communication between the controller and base station. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the security system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low skill level attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
