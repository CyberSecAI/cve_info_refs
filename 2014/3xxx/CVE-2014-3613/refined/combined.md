# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3613 CVE-2014-3620

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. They can be use to leak cookie information:

CVE-2014-3613

    By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP
    addresses properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can
    be fooled to both sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing
    arbitrary sites to set cookies for others.

CVE-2014-3620

    libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
    (TLDs), thus making them apply broader than cookies are allowed.
    This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get
    sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy10.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

## Topic

Updated curl packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP,
FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able
to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw
to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related
issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication
of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS
option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the
application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs
with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP
proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or
construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the wrong
authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials for HTTP
Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in subsequent requests,
although a different set of credentials was specified. (CVE-2015-3143,
CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.

Bug fixes:

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was available

with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force downgrade of the
SSL version. The fallback has been removed from libcurl. Users requiring
this functionality can explicitly enable SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API.
(BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the destination

file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the file, two events
were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened only once per upload.
(BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate

unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the "--retry" option with the curl utility could cause curl to

terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding "--retry" no
longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The "curl --trace-time" command did not use the correct local time when

printing timestamps. Now, "curl --trace-time" works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks on

curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape Portable
Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer reports the memory
leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the

CURLINFO\_HEADER\_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own headers to
the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid. (BZ#1161163)

Enhancements:

* The "--tlsv1.0", "--tlsv1.1", and "--tlsv1.2" options are available for

specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated by NSS.
The "--tlsv1" option now negotiates the highest version of the TLS protocol
supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the new

AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) .

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c0)  Florian Weimer    2014-10-17 12:26:15 UTC  ``` We should disable the retry-with-SSL-3.0 behavior in curl because it can be trivially triggered by an on-path attacker to cause a protocol downgrade, and SSL 3.0 has several known weaknesses.  This curl behavior is quite surprising because it is restricted to the NSS backend, and other systems which use the OpenSSL or GNUTLS backend do not share this behavior.  At this stage, it is best to leave SSL 3.0 enabled.  (The in-protocol version negotiation has not been broken, sosome TLS version will be used automatically if supported by the server.)  This might reintroduce [bug 525496](show_bug.cgi?id=525496 "CLOSED ERRATA - Unable to open some https urls, NSS error -12226") and [bug 527771](show_bug.cgi?id=527771 "CLOSED ERRATA - curl is unable to connect via SSL, NSS error -12229"), so a system-wide knob to re-enable the SSL 3.0 fallback might be necessary.  Perhaps the existence of a file like /etc/sysconfig/curl/enable-ssl-fallback could re-enable the old behavior.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-23 16:02:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Weimer from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c0)) > This might reintroduce [bug 525496](show_bug.cgi?id=525496 "CLOSED ERRATA - Unable to open some https urls, NSS error -12226") and [bug 527771](show_bug.cgi?id=527771 "CLOSED ERRATA - curl is unable to connect via SSL, NSS error -12229"), so a system-wide knob to > re-enable the SSL 3.0 fallback might be necessary.

Do curl try to fall back across multiple versions (TLS 1.1 -> TLS 1.0 -> SSL 3.0), or if connection attempt with the highest supported fails, it goes straight to SSL 3.0?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c4)  Kamil Dudka    2014-10-23 16:06:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c3)) > Or environment variable?

The fallback implemented by libcurl goes straight to SSL 3.0.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1154059#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 05:43:47 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1136154#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-02 04:15:01 UTC  ``` Daniel Stenberg reported the following vulnerability in cURL that could cause libcurl-based HTTP clients to leak cookie information:  IP address as domain problem     By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP addresses    properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can be fooled to both    sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing arbitrary sites to set    cookies for others.     For this problem to trigger, the client application must use the numerical    IP address in the URL to access the site and the site must send back cookies    to the site using domain= and a partial IP address.     Since libcurl wrongly approaches the IP address like it was a normal domain    name, a site at IP address 192.168.0.1 can set cookies for anything ending    with .168.0.1 thus fooling libcurl to send them also to for example    127.168.0.1.     The flaw requires dots to be present in the IP address, which restricts the    flaw to IPv4 literal addresses or IPv6 addresses using the somewhat unusual    "dotted-quad" style: "::ffff:192.0.2.128"     This is not believed to be done by typical sites as this is not supported by    clients that adhere to the rules of the RFC 6265, and many sites are written    to explictly use their own specific named domain when sending cookies.  Versions 7.1 up to and including 7.37.1 are affected.  Information about how to enable cookies is available from <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Tim Ruehsen as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1136154#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-02 04:16:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 933581](attachment.cgi?id=933581&action=diff "patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=933581&action=edit "patch from upstream") patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1136154#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-08 18:21:41 UTC  ``` This issue can affect applications using curl if they enabled cookie support and are used to access HTTP/HTTPS servers using IP address rather than host name.  To take advantage of the problem, attacker needs to trick victim into connecting to their malicious server using its IP address.  The IP of the malicious server must have the last two or three octets of it match relevant octets of a non-malicious server IP victim normally connects to (i.e. using example from [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1136154#c0), if victim normally connects to 192.168.0.1, attack's malicious server must use an IP ending with 168.0.1 or 0.1).  In such case, attacker's server can send cookies with crafted 'domain' attribute that will be sent to the target server.  This can provide an attacker with a way to exploit other cookie handling bugs on the target server (e.g. session fixation issues, or other issues related to improper sanitization of cookie values).  It does not seem this issue can lead to leak of cookies in any reasonable use case.  A non-malicious server would have to incorrectly set 'domain' attributes on cookies it returns to risk their expose to other servers.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1136154#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-08 18:23:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and is not planned to be corrected in future updates.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
