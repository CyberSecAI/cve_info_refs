| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the userRequest servlet. It is possible to inject arbitrary operating system commands when the servlet is processing auth, auth\_session, auth\_simple, add, add\_flat, remove, set\_pwd, add\_permissions, revoke\_permissions, runAsync, and tsmRequest commands. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |

Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |
