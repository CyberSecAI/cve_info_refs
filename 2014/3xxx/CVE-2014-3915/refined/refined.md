Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `userRequest` servlet of Rocket Servergraph Admin Center for Tivoli Storage Manager. It is caused by the improper handling of user-supplied input, which allows for the injection of arbitrary operating system commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The `userRequest` servlet fails to properly sanitize or validate input when processing specific commands (auth, auth\_session, auth\_simple, add, add\_flat, remove, set\_pwd, add\_permissions, revoke\_permissions, runAsync, and tsmRequest), allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** The advisory explicitly states that "Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability." This means that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability without needing valid credentials.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
    *   **System-Level Privileges:** The code execution occurs under the context of the SYSTEM user, which grants the attacker complete control over the compromised system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection. The `userRequest` servlet is the specific target that attackers would interact with.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   **No Authentication:** No user credentials or prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly without a patch due to lack of vendor response.
    *   The advisory provides a timeline of attempts to contact the vendor, none of which resulted in a patch.
    *   Mitigation is to restrict access to the vulnerable service to trusted machines through firewall rules and whitelisting.

This advisory provides more details about the specific commands that are vulnerable to command injection, and also provides a detailed timeline of attempts to contact the vendor.
