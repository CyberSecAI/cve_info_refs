# USN-2242-1: dpkg vulnerabilities

10 June 2014

A malicious source package could write files outside the unpack directory.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [dpkg](/security/cves?package=dpkg) - Debian package management system

## Details

It was discovered that dpkg incorrectly handled certain patches when

unpacking source packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked

into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could

modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of

service or potentially gaining access to the system.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libdpkg-perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dpkg)
  -
  [1.17.5ubuntu5.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dpkg/1.17.5ubuntu5.3)

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [libdpkg-perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dpkg)

  -
  [1.15.5.6ubuntu4.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dpkg/1.15.5.6ubuntu4.9)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Directory traversal was already possible. I have suggested a solution.
That is the way I fixed it: dry run, let the patch tool say what files
will be touched. Another solution would be to stop using an external
tool.

I will wait two days before releasing one of the exploit packages.

Ok, now I'm confused, do you mean there's another security problem?
And that you've got a patch fixing it, or just that you would fix it
that way?

Didn't you do that before filing this bug report in:

  <<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746306#61>>

?

If so, I'd appreciate if you could send me a PoC package.

Ok, I decided to take a look just now, and I've found one issue,
although as I don't know if it's the same we might end up having
to prepare multiple security updates…

I'll provide more details to the security team in private, and start
preparing fixed packages for all suites.

Thanks,
Guillem

Ok, had already found and reported this second one to the security
team earlier today. So with this and the one I found yesterday,
there's nothing new here (and there's no problem disclosing there's
more than one issue now, as one is enough to exploit this).

Thanks,

commit 5348cbc981a65c3c9b05bb4d13553bda930c2d78
Author: Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>
Date:   Fri May 2 01:41:18 2014 +0200

    Dpkg::Source::Patch: Fix patch header parsing to avoid directory traversals

    The code parsing the patches was not taking into account that patches
    w/ partial or no pathname headers are still valid patches, and that
    they can specify the pathname in the Index: pseudo-header or in a
    single «+++ » pathname header, which allows doing directory traversal
    when unpacking source packages.

    The first vector is due to how the Index: pseudo-header is handled by
    patch. Its value gets used (on non-POSIX mode) only when both «+++ »
    and «--- » pathname headers do not provide a pathname, by either having
    an empty pathname or by the header being completely absent. The minimal
    fix for this is to just consider that we've parsed the header when we
    see a hunk header marker «@@ -». This is [CVE-2014-3865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3865) and #749183.

    The other vector is due to patches with only a «+++ » pathname header,
    which get skipped by the parser as it only checks for «--- » pathname
    header lines. The minimal fix for this is to also check for «+++ » when
    parsing the patch header. This is [CVE-2014-3864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3864) and #746498.

    The first issue is a superset of the second, and its fix is sufficient
    and covers and fixes too the second vector, as the «@@ -» marker is
    mandatory for a patch to be valid.

    An unspecified directory traversal vulnerability was initially reported
    in #746498 by Javier Serrano Polo <javier@jasp.net>, and while no
    information had been provided, I independently found #749183 and what
    was supposed to be #746498, which was later on published.

    Fixes: [CVE-2014-3864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3864), [CVE-2014-3865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3865)

Changes:
 dpkg (1.17.10) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   [ Guillem Jover ]
   * Use libtool to build the static libraries, which makes it possible to
     embed libcompat inside libdpkg, as required by some external programs
     linking against the latter. Closes: #[746122](bugreport.cgi?bug=746122)
   * Fix word wrapping logic in dselect. Regression introduced in dpkg 1.17.3.
   * Fix possible out of bounds buffer read access in the error output on
     bogus ar member sizes.
   * Fix memory leaks in buffer_copy() on error conditions.
   * Test suite:
     - Improve C code coverage.
     - Add template test cases for most perl modules.
     - Add test cases for Dpkg::Deps OR relationships.
     - Add minimal test case for Dpkg::Source::Quilt.
     - Add test cases for Dpkg::Source::Patch [CVE-2014-0471](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0471) and [CVE-2014-3127](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3127).
     - Add test case for patch disabling hunks; not security sensitive.
   * Fix non-security sensitive TOCTOU race in triggers database loading.
   * Fix non-security sensitive TOCTOU race in update-alternative alternative
     database loading.
   * Fix non-security sensitive TOCTOU race in update-alternative rename code.
   * Add a workaround to start-stop-daemon for bogus OpenVZ Linux kernels that
     prepend, instead of appending, the " (deleted)" marker in /proc/PID/exe.
     Closes: #[731530](bugreport.cgi?bug=731530)
   * Move dpkg-architecture -L argument to the Commands --help output section.
   * Make dpkg-maintscript-helper print only once that we are moving a
     conffile, and not on every interim state transition. Closes: #[747370](bugreport.cgi?bug=747370)
   * Do not use global match variables in perl code.
   * Man pages:
     - Attempt to clarify and improve wording of some strange or confused
       constructs. Reported by Helge Kreutzmann.
     - Expand Vcs-* field names into each supported field name in
       deb-src-control(5) to make it easier to search for them.
     - Change control.tar.gz reference to simply control.tar in deb(5).
     - Document in dpkg-deb(1) -Z option that bzip2 and lzma are deprecated.
     - Add notes in dpkg-gensymbols(1) about symbol backward-compatibility.
       Based on a patch by Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org>.
       Closes: #[746973](bugreport.cgi?bug=746973)
     - Document that dpkg-buildpackage(1) -j argument is optional.
     - Add current and deprecated media types to deb(5).
     - Document in dpkg(1) that --audit now does more than just searching for
       partially installed packages.
   * Add support for automatic parallel job selection in dpkg-buildpackage,
     matching currently active processors, when using -jauto. Closes: #[748012](bugreport.cgi?bug=748012)
   * Perl modules:
     - Bump $VERSION for Dpkg::Patch, missed in 1.16.1.
     - Bump $VERSION for Dpkg::Deps, missed in 1.17.0.
     - Update and fix CHANGES POD sections for public modules.
     - Add missing Dpkg::Deps::Multiple profile_is_concerned() and
       reduce_profiles() methods, inherited by Dpkg::Deps::Union,
       Dpkg::Deps::AND and Dpkg::Deps::OR.
   * Do not mangle quilt series files with a missing newline on the last line.
     Closes: #[584233](bugreport.cgi?bug=584233)
   * Quiesce tar warnings in cron job by redirecting stderr to /dev/null, as
     it seems --warning=none does not work correctly. Closes: #[748544](bugreport.cgi?bug=748544)
   * Do not emit a trailing space from Dpkg::Control::Hash on a field's empty
     first line. Bump dpkg-dev Breaks on devscripts to 2.14.4, as previous
     versions expect a trailing space from dpkg-parsechangelog output.
     Based on a patch by Johannes Schauer <j.schauer@email.de>. Closes: #[749044](bugreport.cgi?bug=749044)
   * Do not assume that sensible-editor is present on «dpkg-source --commit»,
     as that command is very Debian specific. Fallback to try VISUAL, EDITOR,
     or vi, if the previous commands are either unset or not found.
   * Use badusage() instead of ohshit() on dpkg --ignore-depends argument
     parsing errors.
   * Add per package dpkg --audit support.
   * Add support for DragonFlyBSD to ostable and triplettable.
     Thanks to Hleb Valoshka <375gnu@gmail.com>.
   * Add support for DragonFlyBSD to start-stop-daemon. Closes: #[734452](bugreport.cgi?bug=734452)
     Based on a patch by Hleb Valoshka <375gnu@gmail.com>.
   * Correctly parse patch headers in Dpkg::Source::Patch, to avoid directory
     traversal attempts from hostile source packages when unpacking them.
     Reported by Javier Serrano Polo <javier@jasp.net> as an unspecified
     directory traversal; meanwhile also independently found by me both
     #749183 and what was supposed to be #746498, which was later on published
     and ended up being just a subset of the other non-reported issue.
     Fixes [CVE-2014-3864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3864) and [CVE-2014-3865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3865). Closes: #[746498](bugreport.cgi?bug=746498), #[749183](bugreport.cgi?bug=749183)
 .
   [ Updated programs translations ]
   * Catalan (Guillem Jover).
   * Italian (Milo Casagrande). Closes: #[750105](bugreport.cgi?bug=750105)
 .
   [ Updated scripts translations ]
   * German (Helge Kreutzmann).
 .
   [ Updated manpages translations ]
   * German (Helge Kreutzmann).

   [ Raphaël Hertzog ]
   * Let dpkg-source unpack additional tarballs in a deterministic order.

    Dpkg::Source::Patch: Fix patch header parsing to avoid directory traversals

    Cherry picked from commit 5348cbc981a65c3c9b05bb4d13553bda930c2d78.

    The code parsing the patches was not taking into account that patches
    w/ partial or no pathname headers are still valid patches, and that
    they can specify the pathname in the Index: pseudo-header or in a
    single «+++ » pathname header, which allows doing directory traversal
    when unpacking source packages.

    The first vector is due to how the Index: pseudo-header is handled by
    patch. Its value gets used (on non-POSIX mode) only when both «+++ »
    and «--- » pathname headers do not provide a pathname, by either having
    an empty pathname or by the header being completely absent. The minimal
    fix for this is to just consider that we've parsed the header when we
    see a hunk header marker «@@ -». This is [CVE-2014-3865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3865) and #749183.

    The other vector is due to patches with only a «+++ » pathname header,
    which get skipped by the parser as it only checks for «--- » pathname
    header lines. The minimal fix for this is to also check for «+++ » when
    parsing the patch header. This is [CVE-2014-3864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3864) and #746498.

    The first issue is a superset of the second, and its fix is sufficient
    and covers and fixes too the second vector, as the «@@ -» marker is
    mandatory for a patch to be valid.

    An unspecified directory traversal vulnerability was initially reported
    in #746498 by Javier Serrano Polo <javier@jasp.net>, and while no
    information had been provided, I independently found #749183 and what
    was supposed to be #746498, which was later on published.

    Fixes: [CVE-2014-3864](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3864), [CVE-2014-3865](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3865)

Subject: CVE request: another path traversal in dpkg-source during unpack

Hi,

Another path traversal was discovered[1] in dpkg-source, related to the
unpacking of source packages with specially-crafted patches.
While waiting for the original reporter's PoC/more information, Guillem
Jover (dpkg maintainer) independently re-discovered the issue, and a second
one.
This second issue has now been publicly reported as [2] to ease the
assignment of CVE id(s) given the combination of private and not-very-
specific public information.

Both issues are independent of the version of the patch tool.

While figuring out whether one or two ids should be requested (at least from
our POV), it appears that we can say that [2] is a superset of [1] - this is
based on the minimal fixes needed to fix either vulnerability: the fix for [1]
does not fix [2], but the fix for [2] does fix [1].

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

CC'ing Guillem for any complimentary information.

Thanks in advance.

[2] <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749183>

Package        : dpkg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3864 CVE-2014-3865
Debian Bug     : 746498 749183

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in dpkg that allow file
modification through path traversal when unpacking source packages with
especially-crafted patch files.

This update had been scheduled before the end of security support for
the oldstable distribution (squeeze), hence an exception has been made
and was released through the security archive. However, no further updates
should be expected.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.15.11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.16.15.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.10.

We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.
