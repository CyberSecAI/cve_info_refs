{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-3430",
  "description": "Dovecot before 2.2.13 is vulnerable to a DoS attack against imap/pop3-login processes. If SSL/TLS handshake was started but wasn't finished, the login process attempted to eventually forcibly disconnect the client, but failed to do it correctly. This could have left the connections hanging around for a long time (CVE-2014-3430).",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to Dovecot not properly closing old connections when a SSL/TLS handshake was started but not completed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to incomplete SSL/TLS handshake handling."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting the connection pool, preventing legitimate connections to the IMAP/POP3 server.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network",
      "Remote attacker initiating incomplete SSL/TLS handshakes"
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to initiate TCP connections to the IMAP/POP3 ports (e.g., 993 for IMAPS).",
    "additionalDetails": "The \"destroy oldest connection\" mechanism failed for connections that had started SSL/TLS handshake, but haven't finished it. This allows an attacker to create multiple TCP connections and leave them hanging."
