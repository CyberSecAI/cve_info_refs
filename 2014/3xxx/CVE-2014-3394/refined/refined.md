{
  "CVE-2014-3394": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because when Smart Call Home (SCH) is configured, a trustpoint, including a VeriSign certificate, is automatically installed.",
    "Weaknesses": "Improper digital certificate validation in the Smart Call Home (SCH) feature.",
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass digital certificate validation if any feature that uses digital certificates is configured on the affected system. This could allow an attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication when used by a given feature like VPN and ASDM authentication, TLS Proxy, and Phone Proxy.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker presents a valid certificate signed by VeriSign when authenticating to the affected system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the affected system and present a valid certificate signed by VeriSign."
