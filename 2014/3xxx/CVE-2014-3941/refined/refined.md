  "CVE-2014-3941": {
    "Description": "TYPO3 4.5.0 before 4.5.34, 4.7.0 before 4.7.19, 6.0.0 before 6.0.14, 6.1.0 before 6.1.9, and 6.2.0 before 6.2.3 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted HTTP Host header, related to \"Host Spoofing.\"",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly validate the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses this header to generate absolute URLs in various contexts, such as 404 handling, HTTPS enforcement, and password reset links. Because the Host header is client-provided, it can be forged.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Host Spoofing"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is unspecified. However, the crafted HTTP Host header can lead to host spoofing, potentially causing redirection to malicious sites via crafted links generated by the application. This could be used for phishing attacks or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP Host header.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication."
