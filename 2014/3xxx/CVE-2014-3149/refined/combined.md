following a responsible disclosure process.
Severity
===================
Low
Exploitability
===================
Clickjacking or social engineering required
Description
===================
Using a specially crafted request to access the web forum software IP.Board it
is possible to execute Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Due to a
token-based CSRF protection the actual exploitation is somewhat limited, since
attackers have to trick victims (using Clickjacking or social engineering)
into submitting an attacker supplied content.
Proof of concept

Due to the responsible disclosure process chosen and to not harm unpatched systems,
no concrete exploit code will be presented in this advisory.
