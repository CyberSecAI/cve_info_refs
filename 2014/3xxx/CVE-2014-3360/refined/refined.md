Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3360

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation within Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. This flaw could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload (reboot).

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect processing of specific crafted SIP messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper handling of specific SIP messages leads to a denial-of-service condition.
*   The vulnerability lies in the SIP implementation of Cisco IOS/IOS XE software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to a device reload (Denial of Service).
*   The vulnerability results in service disruption due to device unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted SIP message.
*   The crafted message can be sent either within an existing call or during the initiation of a new call.
*   The exploit only works against traffic destined to the device itself, and not transit SIP traffic.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using SIP over IPv4 or IPv6, as well as over UDP or TCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected device, with the ability to craft SIP messages.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to reach the device's SIP listening ports, either the default ports 5060 (UDP/TCP) or 5061 (TCP with TLS) or a non-default port if configured.
