Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-3996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `LinkViewFetchServlet`.
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `sv` parameter in a GET request.
- The vulnerability is present in ManageEngine Desktop Central, Password Manager Pro, and IT360.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows for potential remote code execution as SYSTEM on Windows or as the user in Linux.
- In Desktop Central/IT360, this can lead to control over all managed computers and smartphones.
- In Password Manager Pro, this can lead to access to stored passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the vulnerable servlet.
- Specifically, the `sv` parameter within the URL is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For Desktop Central and Password Manager Pro, no authentication is required.
- For IT360, a valid user account is needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.

**Affected Products/Versions:**
- ManageEngine Desktop Central (DC) [MSP]: all versions from v4 up to v9 build 90033
- ManageEngine Password Manager Pro (PMP) [MSP]: all versions from v5 to version 7 build 7002
- ManageEngine IT360 [MSP]: all versions from v8 to v10.1.1 build 10110
- This affects all versions of the products released since 19-Apr-2006.

**Proof of Concept:**
- DC / PMP: `GET /LinkViewFetchServlet.dat?sv=[SQLi]`
- IT360: `GET /console/LinkViewFetchServlet.dat?sv=[SQLi]`

**Fix:**
- Upgrade to DC v9 build 90043; PMP v7 build 7003; IT360 v10.3.3 build 10330
