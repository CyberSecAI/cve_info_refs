Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3552:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Shibboleth authentication plugin allowing empty session IDs. This led to session confusion when multiple instances were associated with the same empty ID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is a flaw in session management within the Shibboleth authentication plugin. The system didn't properly handle or validate session IDs, specifically when they were empty.
-  The vulnerability allowed for session hijacking or takeover.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially take over another user's session.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the victim's account, potentially allowing for data theft, privilege escalation, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Shibboleth authentication plugin itself.
- Exploitation involves manipulating the session handling mechanisms by using an empty session ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to authenticate via the vulnerable Shibboleth authentication method.
-  The attacker would need knowledge of how the empty session IDs were being handled to exploit the session confusion.
