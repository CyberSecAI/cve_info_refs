Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-3849, which is one of multiple CVEs linked to the iMember360 WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The iMember360 WordPress plugin had multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and permission checks on various GET parameters. This allowed attackers to trigger special functionalities without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** The `i4w_dbinfo` parameter allowed retrieval of database credentials (name, user, password, encoding). In older versions, this was directly accessible via a GET request. Later, it required a user to be logged in, even as a subscriber requesting an admin URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `decrypt` and `encrypt` parameters would print the input verbatim onto the page, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. This could be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** The `i4w_clearuser` and `Email` parameters allowed an attacker to delete a user from the WordPress database. This was possible when the plugin's API key was null (i.e., not activated).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `i4w_trace` parameter would pass unescaped values to the system shell. This allowed arbitrary code execution when the page was requested by an administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** Sensitive database information could be obtained by an attacker leading to potential compromise of the entire website and its data.
*   **XSS Vulnerabilities:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts to perform phishing attacks, redirect users, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions on the compromised website.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** Attackers could delete users from the WordPress database, potentially removing administrative accounts.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could gain complete control over the server by executing arbitrary system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **GET Parameter Manipulation:** All vulnerabilities were triggered by manipulating GET parameters in the URL.
*   **Phishing:** Exploiting the XSS and code execution vulnerabilities required the user to click a maliciously crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** No authentication was needed for older versions. Newer versions required a logged in user requesting an admin URL.
*  **XSS Vulnerabilities:** No authentication was needed. The attacker only needed to craft a malicious URL.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** No authentication needed if the plugin's license was not activated (API key is null). Otherwise, the attacker would need to know a valid API key.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker needed to convince an administrator to click on a crafted link, and the administrator needed to be logged in.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The author of the plugin was hostile to vulnerability reports.
*   The plugin was reportedly installed on around 5,000 sites worldwide.
* The vulnerabilities were found through dictionary-based URL scanning which revealed the vulnerable parameters.
*  The specific vulnerable versions are from 3.8.012 to 3.9.001.
