{
  "CVE-2014-3569": {
    "Description": "The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake to a no-ssl3 application with certain error handling. NOTE: this issue became relevant after the CVE-2014-3568 fix.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of unsupported protocols in the ssl23_get_client_hello function in OpenSSL when built without SSLv3 support.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper error handling",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending an unexpected handshake (e.g., SSLv3 handshake) to an application not supporting the protocol, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network attack by sending a crafted handshake message to an OpenSSL server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to send network packets to the target. No authentication is required."
