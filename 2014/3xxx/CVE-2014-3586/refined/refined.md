```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Command Line Interface (CLI) of Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform creates a history file named .jboss-cli-history in the user's home directory with insecure default file permissions.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Insecure default file permissions on the .jboss-cli-history file.

Impact of exploitation:
A malicious local user can gain access to information otherwise not accessible, such as potentially sensitive commands and arguments previously executed via the CLI.

Attack vectors:
A malicious local user gains access to the .jboss-cli-history file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Attacker must be a local user on the system where the affected JBoss Enterprise Application Platform instance is running and have access to the user's home directory.
