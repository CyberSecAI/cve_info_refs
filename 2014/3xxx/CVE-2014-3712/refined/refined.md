Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of the `to_sym` method in Ruby on user-supplied parameters within the Katello application. Specifically, user-provided input is being directly converted to Ruby symbols using `to_sym`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symbol Creation Denial of Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can cause a denial-of-service by creating a large number of unique symbols. In Ruby, symbols are not garbage collected, which means excessive creation can consume memory and lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service, likely by causing the application to crash due to excessive memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** The attack vector involves crafting HTTP requests that include user-controlled parameters. These parameters are then passed to the vulnerable `to_sym` method.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `katello/content_search_controller.rb` and `katello/api/api_controller.rb` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an authenticated user with the ability to send HTTP requests. The CVSS score AV:N/AC:M/Au:S indicates that a successful exploit requires an authenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in two specific locations within the Katello codebase.
*   Red Hat assigned a low priority and severity to this vulnerability.
*   A related issue was tracked with Redmine issue ID [8263](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/8263).
*   This vulnerability is a duplicate of bug 1153824.
*   The vulnerability has been classified as "CLOSED WONTFIX". This typically indicates that the issue will not be resolved directly, potentially due to the nature of the code or mitigation strategies implemented.
