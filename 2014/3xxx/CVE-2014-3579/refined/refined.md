The provided content relates to CVE-2014-3579.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Apache ActiveMQ Apollo allowed consumers to specify XPath-based selectors when dequeuing XML messages. This caused the broker to evaluate the expressions and match them against messages in the queue. Critically, this process also performed XML external entity resolution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection: The broker attempts to resolve external entities defined in the XML messages, leading to potential XXE vulnerabilities.
- XPath Injection: The use of XPath selectors introduces the possibility of injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform actions such as retrieving arbitrary files from the server, conducting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, or causing denial-of-service by exploiting the XML processing.
- The combination of XXE and XPath injection can lead to severe security breaches, allowing for data exfiltration or remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious XML messages with carefully designed XPath selectors and external entity definitions, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- Attackers could send specifically crafted messages to a queue being consumed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to publish XML messages to a queue monitored by a vulnerable Apache ActiveMQ Apollo instance.
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the XPath selector used by the message consumer.
- Access to the ActiveMQ Apollo broker is necessary, either through network access or other forms of access control bypass.
