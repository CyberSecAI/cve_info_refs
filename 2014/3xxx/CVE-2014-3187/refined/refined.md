Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of URL schemes by Google Chrome on iOS, specifically with `facetime://` and `facetime-audio://` URL handlers.
*   Chrome on iOS would directly initiate FaceTime calls using these schemes without user confirmation when triggered from a webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure URL Handling:** Chrome doesn't validate or seek user confirmation before executing a `facetime://` or `facetime-audio://` URL scheme request.
*   **Lack of User Interaction Requirement:** The vulnerability allowed for the automated triggering of calls without any user interaction beyond clicking on a link (the initial click is to navigate to the malicious website, not to approve the call).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Automated FaceTime Calls:** Attackers could force a device to initiate FaceTime calls without user consent or knowledge.
*   **Potential for Social Engineering:** By embedding malicious links in messages or websites, attackers could trick users into unknowingly initiating calls.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** The vulnerability could be used to potentially capture video and audio of users for a few seconds until they realize what is happening.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** An attacker could host a webpage containing a specially crafted link that redirects to a chrome URL handler which then launches the facetime call.
*   **Malicious Links:** Sending a crafted URL via iMessage or other means, that when clicked will redirect to a malicious webpage which then triggers the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or control content on a webpage where a malicious link can be inserted.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** To trick users into clicking on the malicious link to begin with.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The exploit chain involved using a URL in Safari that would redirect the user to a secondary page within Chrome and then trigger the vulnerable FaceTime call using a URL handler.
*   The vulnerability was not exploitable directly through the Messages app itself because of the way that app handles URL schemes.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Google Chrome for iOS version 37.0.2062.60.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2014-3187 after it was made public.
*  The vulnerability was used as an example within a tool called "Cartero", which was used to demonstrate the sending of mass automated messages.
