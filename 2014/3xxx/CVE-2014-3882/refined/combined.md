| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |

Very versatile, was able to setup two separate login urls, neither of which were Wordpress default locations, and each limited to only allow audience or admin access. Thanks you!

私が開発・保守したサイトには必ず導入する必須プラグインとして、とても重宝しています。WordPressのログインURLを簡単に変更できて、ログインログも見れるし、商用・個人問わずセキュアなサイトを構築する際には最優先でインストールしておくべきプラグインかと思っています。コアにバンドルしてもおかしくない程です。
すばらしいプラグインを作成していただき、ありがとうございます！

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |

Base Score:4.0
