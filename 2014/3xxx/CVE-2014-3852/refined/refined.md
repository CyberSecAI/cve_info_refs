Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Pyplate application does not set the `HttpOnly` flag on the "id" cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing `HttpOnly` flag on the "id" cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If the "id" cookie is not set with the `HttpOnly` flag, it can be accessed by client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript). This allows an attacker to potentially steal the cookie via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable part of the web application, which then executes in the victim's browser. This malicious script can access the "id" cookie and send it to the attacker, potentially impersonating a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application (XSS vulnerability required) or use some other means to get the script executed in the browser of the victim.
