Subject: [OSSA 2014-024] Use of non-constant time comparison operation
 (CVE-2014-3517)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-024
CVE: CVE-2014-3517
Date: July 17, 2014
Title: Use of non-constant time comparison operation
Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)
Products: Nova
Versions: Up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in Nova.
By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker
may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access
to important configuration details of another instance. Only setups
configured to proxy metadata requests via Neutron are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/107396>

Icehouse
<https://review.openstack.org/107397>

Havana
<https://review.openstack.org/107398>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in future
2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases

Since the nova security reviewers have been too busy to weigh in on this yet, I've added a few reviewers from the OSSG to help evaluate risk and exploitability.

If this demonstrably makes it possible to guess an HMAC token gaining unintended access/privileges in a supported release of nova and can be fixed in a stable backport, then we likely need to keep it embargoed while patches are assembled. Otherwise, I suspect this is a security hardening improvement we can discuss and develop far more efficiently in the open.

This particularly one hasn't been demonstrated to be exploitable, however this precise pattern has: <http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/>

If someone more familiar with this bit of code and the implications can weigh in and says it's fine, I'm happy to just send up a CR for this.

I'm basing the following comments on just having gone through the code paths before this comparison takes place so confirmation from someone more familiar with this flow would be nice.

But from what I'm seeing there is no user input that makes it into the token generation, depending on how networking access is structured for the nova metadata service. This token comparison is based on CONF.service\_neutron\_metadata\_proxy being set which means the deployer is expecting the Neutron namespace proxy to be setup. The namespace proxy does a lookup based on the ip address of the instance making a query to it, and populates the X-Instance-ID header based on that result and then forwards to the Nova metadata service. I would hope that the metadata service would not be directly accessible from instances.

If the metadata service is accessible from instances and CONF.service\_neutron\_metadata\_proxy is set to True then this would be theoretically vulnerable to a timing attack. The result of which would be gaining access to information about another instance. It should be noted that this bug includes Neutron as well since it performs the signing so any change would have to be coordinated across both services.

Looks reasonable to me, we should probably add a constant time comparison to oslo so it can be shared across multiple projects.

So it seems there's some consensus that this is not generally exploitable and can instead be fixed in public as a hardening measure?

As for adding a constant time comparison to oslo, are there not already existing Python modules which can provide that so we don't reinvent the wheel (the age old adage of not rolling one's own crypto primitives seems applicable here, even if this isn't strictly a cryptographic matter)?

PyCA cryptography (cryptography.io) has one, as does Django, and the stdlib has one in 2.7.8+/3.4+ IIRC, probably a bunch of other projects have them too (I know for a fact both keystoneclient and swift do).

I would be ok with opening this up to be a public bug. The exploit is theoretical at this point, and even the included links contain theoretical attacks with no proof of concept code. And in general this token compare should not be receiving user input, though that is dependent on the deployment setup.

History is littered with attack vectors that were only theoretical - until they weren't.

Are there reasonable configuration steps that can be taken to lessen the risk?

Also, is the proposed patch something we would consider backporting to stable release branches? It does look trivial, introducing no new dependencies nor config options, so I'm assuming yes.

So if we are going to issue an advisory for this maybe we could do something like this for the impact description:

Title: Use of non-constant time comparison operation

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Nova

Versions: Up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Alex Gaynor of Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in Nova.

By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker

may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access

to important configuration details of another instance. Only setups

configured to proxy metadata requests via Neturon are affected.

configured to proxy metadata requests via Neutron are affected.

Disclosure day/date schedule TBD. In preparation can we please get a definitive +1 / +2 on the patch from nova-coresec ?

CVE assigned using the following impact description:
Title: Use of non-constant time comparison operation
Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)
Products: Nova
Versions: Up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1
Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in Nova.
By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker
may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access
to important configuration details of another instance. Only setups
configured to proxy metadata requests via Neutron are affected.
Disclosure day/date schedule TBD. In preparation can we please get a definitive +1 / +2 on the patch from nova-coresec ?

I am +2 on russell's patch (assuming it passes gate tests, etc), as it seems to do the right thing, as far as I can tell from that article.

I would love to get someone to have time to do a manual test of that patch, but I think it makes sense.

FWIW Keystone uses a slightly more comprehensive approach than the proposed patch -

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py#L88>

We should probably at least fall back to hmac.compare\_digest if it is available.

The original patch supplied no longer applies cleanly to master. I've tweaked it to the keystone version and back-ported to supported security levels.

Can we get these patches reviewed and approved? I would like to send the pre-OSSA out soon with a view to have a disclosure date of mid next week.

### Bug Description

Here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/HEAD/nova/api/metadata/handler.py#L173>

a constant time comparison should be used, more information on this type of attack here: <http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/>

An example constant time comparison in Python can be found here: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/crypto.py#L80> or via the PyCA cryptography library: <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/constant-time/>

Since the nova security reviewers have been too busy to weigh in on this yet, I've added a few reviewers from the OSSG to help evaluate risk and exploitability.

If this demonstrably makes it possible to guess an HMAC token gaining unintended access/privileges in a supported release of nova and can be fixed in a stable backport, then we likely need to keep it embargoed while patches are assembled. Otherwise, I suspect this is a security hardening improvement we can discuss and develop far more efficiently in the open.

This particularly one hasn't been demonstrated to be exploitable, however this precise pattern has: <http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/>

If someone more familiar with this bit of code and the implications can weigh in and says it's fine, I'm happy to just send up a CR for this.

I'm basing the following comments on just having gone through the code paths before this comparison takes place so confirmation from someone more familiar with this flow would be nice.

But from what I'm seeing there is no user input that makes it into the token generation, depending on how networking access is structured for the nova metadata service. This token comparison is based on CONF.service\_neutron\_metadata\_proxy being set which means the deployer is expecting the Neutron namespace proxy to be setup. The namespace proxy does a lookup based on the ip address of the instance making a query to it, and populates the X-Instance-ID header based on that result and then forwards to the Nova metadata service. I would hope that the metadata service would not be directly accessible from instances.

If the metadata service is accessible from instances and CONF.service\_neutron\_metadata\_proxy is set to True then this would be theoretically vulnerable to a timing attack. The result of which would be gaining access to information about another instance. It should be noted that this bug includes Neutron as well since it performs the signing so any change would have to be coordinated across both services.

Looks reasonable to me, we should probably add a constant time comparison to oslo so it can be shared across multiple projects.

So it seems there's some consensus that this is not generally exploitable and can instead be fixed in public as a hardening measure?

As for adding a constant time comparison to oslo, are there not already existing Python modules which can provide that so we don't reinvent the wheel (the age old adage of not rolling one's own crypto primitives seems applicable here, even if this isn't strictly a cryptographic matter)?

PyCA cryptography (cryptography.io) has one, as does Django, and the stdlib has one in 2.7.8+/3.4+ IIRC, probably a bunch of other projects have them too (I know for a fact both keystoneclient and swift do).

I would be ok with opening this up to be a public bug. The exploit is theoretical at this point, and even the included links contain theoretical attacks with no proof of concept code. And in general this token compare should not be receiving user input, though that is dependent on the deployment setup.

Yes, I think we can open this one and fix it as a hardening measure. Scream soon if you disagree... otherwise we'll open it in a couple of days.

History is littered with attack vectors that were only theoretical - until they weren't.

Are there reasonable configuration steps that can be taken to lessen the risk?

Also, is the proposed patch something we would consider backporting to stable release branches? It does look trivial, introducing no new dependencies nor config options, so I'm assuming yes.

So if we are going to issue an advisory for this maybe we could do something like this for the impact description:

Title: Use of non-constant time comparison operation

Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)

Products: Nova

Versions: Up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Alex Gaynor of Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in Nova.

By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker

may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access

to important configuration details of another instance. Only setups

configured to proxy metadata requests via Neturon are affected.

I am +2 on russell's patch (assuming it passes gate tests, etc), as it seems to do the right thing, as far as I can tell from that article.

I would love to get someone to have time to do a manual test of that patch, but I think it makes sense.

FWIW Keystone uses a slightly more comprehensive approach than the proposed patch -

<https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/blob/master/keystoneclient/middleware/memcache_crypt.py#L88>

We should probably at least fall back to hmac.compare\_digest if it is available.

The original patch supplied no longer applies cleanly to master. I've tweaked it to the keystone version and back-ported to supported security levels.

Can we get these patches reviewed and approved? I would like to send the pre-OSSA out soon with a view to have a disclosure date of mid next week.
