  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks for port scanning/fingerprinting, denial of service, file disclosure, and attacks against internal functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, such as DNS poisoning/spoofing/hijacking, ARP spoofing, or QUANTUM-style attacks to impersonate securityresponse.symantec.com.",
