{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `routed(8)` daemon, a RIP implementation for FreeBSD, incorrectly handles RIP queries from sources not on a directly connected network.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The input path in `routed(8)` accepts queries from any source without proper validation.",
      "The output path assumes the destination address for responses is on a directly connected network."
    ],
    "impact": "Upon receiving a query from a source not on a directly connected network, `routed(8)` will trigger an assertion and terminate, halting routing table updates. If the affected system is a router, its routes will expire from other routers' routing tables, making its networks unreachable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a RIP query to a vulnerable system running `routed(8)` from a source not on a directly connected network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to port 520 of the target system. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same subnet as the target."
