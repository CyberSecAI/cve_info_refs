FreeBSD-SA-14:21.routed Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: routed(8) remote denial of service vulnerability
Category: core
Module: routed
Announced: 2014-10-21
Credits: Hiroki Sato
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2014-10-21 20:20:07 UTC (stable/10, 10.1-PRERELEASE)

CVE Name: CVE-2014-3955
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The routing information protocol (RIP) is an older routing protocol
which, while not as capable as more recent protocols such as OSPF and
BGP, is sometimes preferred for its simplicity and therefore still
used as an interior gateway protocol on smaller networks.
Routers in a RIP network periodically broadcast their routing table on
all enabled interfaces. Neighboring routers and hosts receive these
broadcasts and update their routing tables accordingly.
The routed(8) daemon is a RIP implementation for FreeBSD. The
rtquery(8) utility can be used to send a RIP query to a router and
display the result without updating the routing table.
II. Problem Description
The input path in routed(8) will accept queries from any source and
attempt to answer them. However, the output path assumes that the
destination address for the response is on a directly connected
network.
III. Impact
Upon receipt of a query from a source which is not on a directly
connected network, routed(8) will trigger an assertion and terminate.
The affected system's routing table will no longer be updated. If the
affected system is a router, its routes will eventually expire from
other routers' routing tables, and its networks will no longer be
reachable unless they are also connected to another router.
IV. Workaround
Use a packet filter such as pf(4) or ipfw(4) to block incoming UDP
packets with destination port 520 that did not originate on the same
subnet as the destination address.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:21/routed.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:21/routed.patch.asc
# gpg --verify routed.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/routed.patch
c) Recompile routed. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src/sbin/routed
# make && make install
4) Restart the affected service
To restart the affected service after updating the system, either
reboot the system or execute the following command as root:
# service routed restart
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/8/ r273413
releng/8.4/ r273416

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
