## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/10/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, October 7, 2014

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 38 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 38.0.2125.101 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

- A number of new apps/extension APIs

- Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A full list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/37.0.2062.0..38.0.2125.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [159 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+-Security_Severity%3DNone), including [113 relatively minor fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+Stability%3DMemory-MemorySanitizer+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles) found using [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting.
