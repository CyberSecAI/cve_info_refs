Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3474:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of the "Network Name" parameter in the OpenStack Horizon user interface. Specifically, the application does not prevent JavaScript injection into the network name, leading to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Persistent XSS: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored within the application's database. This code is then executed whenever a user views the network name in the UI, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize the "Network Name" parameter, which allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
- Insecure Rendering: The application does not properly encode or escape the "Network Name" when rendering it in the UI, allowing the injected JavaScript to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
- Session hijacking: An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by stealing their session cookies and CSRF tokens, leading to unauthorized access to the OpenStack environment.
- Malware implantation: The attacker may use the vulnerability to implant malware, redirect the user to a malicious website or perform other harmful actions.
- Data theft: The attacker can steal sensitive data.
- VM/Network configuration modification: An attacker can potentially modify the VM/Network configuration through the UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Creation: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user who has the capability to create a network. The malicious JavaScript is injected through the "Network Name" parameter during the network creation.
- Stored XSS: The injected code persists in the system. The XSS is triggered when a user views the network name.
- UI Interaction: The XSS is triggered when the network name is rendered in the UI, such as in the "Launch Instance" menu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating networks in OpenStack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found during testing of a Cisco product using OpenStack, and reported by Craig Lorentzen from Cisco.
- The vulnerability affects OpenStack Horizon versions Havana and Icehouse, as well as the master branch.
- A fix for this vulnerability has been released and includes sanitizing the rendering of "Network Name" to prevent XSS.
- The fix was bundled with fixes for other XSS issues (CVE-2014-3473 and CVE-2014-3475).
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is suggested as a further measure to prevent XSS.
