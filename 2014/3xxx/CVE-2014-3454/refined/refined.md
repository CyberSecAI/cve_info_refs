**Attack vectors:**
A malicious website could make a request on behalf of a logged-in user to the vulnerable special pages, without the user's explicit consent, by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a site visited by a logged-in user of the vulnerable MediaWiki installation. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the MediaWiki instance itself. They need to trick a logged-in user into submitting a request.
