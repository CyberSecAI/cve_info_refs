{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An overlooked merge to -STABLE branches resulted in an incorrect size setting for page fault kernel trace entries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect size calculation in ktrace kernel tracing leading to out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user who can enable kernel process tracing can read arbitrary kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information such as file cache, terminal buffers, or user-entered passwords which could lead to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local user with the ability to enable kernel process tracing using the ktrace utility.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Must have a user account on the system with the ability to enable kernel process tracing.  This usually is a non-privileged user if sysctl security.bsd.unprivileged_proc_debug is not set to 0."
