Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3802

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PDB (Program Database) files within the Microsoft Debug Interface Access SDK (msdia.dll). Specifically, a failure to sanitize a value during the parsing process results in an invalid address calculation for a dynamic call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of sanitization of a value read from a PDB file before being used in an address calculation. This lack of proper validation allows an attacker to control the value and potentially influence the address used in the dynamic call.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The incorrect address calculation can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** A user is required to open a malicious PDB file crafted to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** A user visiting a malicious web page could be exposed to this vulnerability through an embedded malicious PDB file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Crafting Malicious PDB:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious PDB file that triggers the vulnerability in the DIA SDK.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker relies on user interaction, either by enticing the user to open a malicious PDB file or visiting a website hosting the malicious PDB file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that Microsoft has issued an update to correct the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   The CVSS score is 6.8, indicating a medium severity level.
