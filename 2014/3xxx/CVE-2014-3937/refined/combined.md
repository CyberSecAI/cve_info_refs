## Description

[Contextual Related Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contextual-related-posts/) is a powerful WordPress plugin that helps you increase your site’s engagement by displaying a list of related posts that are relevant and interesting to your readers.

Contextual Related Posts uses an intelligent algorithm that analyzes your posts’ title and/or content to find the most related ones. This way, you can show your visitors more awesome content and keep them on your site longer.

Contextual Related Posts also comes with many features and options that let you customize the look and feel of the related posts list. You can choose between different styles, layouts, thumbnails, excerpts, and more. You can also use widgets, shortcodes, Gutenberg blocks, or REST API to display the related posts anywhere on your site or in your feed.

With Contextual Related Posts, you can quickly boost your site’s traffic, reduce bounce rates, and refresh old entries. It’s fast, flexible, and easy to use. Try it today and see the difference for yourself!

#### Key features

* **Automatic**: Activate the plugin. Contextual Related Posts automatically displays related posts on your site and feed after the content. There is no need to edit any template files.
* **Manual install**: If you want more control over the placement of the related posts, you can use the FAQ to learn about the functions available for manual installation.
* **Gutenberg / Block Editor support**: You can easily add a “Related Posts [CRP]” block to any post or page with its options and settings.
* **Widgets**: Add related posts to any widgetized theme area, such as the sidebar or footer. You can configure the widget options to suit your needs.
* **Shortcode**: Use `[crp]` to display the related posts anywhere within the post content.
* **REST API**: Fetch related posts for any post ID using `contextual-related-posts/v1/posts/<id>/`. You can also use query parameters to filter or sort the results.
* **The algorithm**: Find related posts based on the current post’s title and/or content. You can also find posts by tags, categories and selected custom fields.
* **Caching**: Related posts output is automatically cached as visitors browse through your site, reducing the load on your server and improving performance.
* **Exclusions**: Exclude posts from specific categories or tags from being displayed in the related posts list. You can exclude specific posts or pages by ID using a meta box on the edit screen.
* **Custom post types**: The related posts list supports posts, pages, attachments, or any other custom post type on your site.
* **Thumbnail support**: Display thumbnails or not!
* **Styles**: The output of the related posts list is wrapped in CSS classes that allow you to style it easily using custom CSS code. You can enter your custom CSS code from within the WordPress admin area or use one of the default styles included with the plugin.
* **Customizable output**: Display post excerpts in the related posts list. You can set the excerpt’s length in words and strip HTML tags if needed. Customize the HTML tags and attributes used to display the output of the related posts list. For example, you can use an ordered or unordered list, a div container, a span element, etc.
* **Extendable code**: Contextual Related Posts has many filters and actions that allow developers to easily add features, modify outputs, or integrate with other plugins.

#### Features in Contextual Related Posts Pro

[CRP Pro](https://webberzone.com/plugins/contextual-related-posts/pro/) enhances your experience with an advanced query block, offering more precise customization options, additional shortcode functionalities, and enhanced meta box settings.

* [Advanced Algorith](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/contextual-related-posts-algorithm/): Set the relative weight of the post title, post content and post excerpt. This feature overrides the default equal weight algorithm of the free version and provides a greater degree of fine-tuning.
* [Query Loop Block](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/contextual-related-posts-blocks/#contextual-related-posts-query-loop-block): An advanced block that allows you to display the related posts based on specified parameters. You can use the pre-built block patterns or create your block patterns for use within posts or the site editor.
* [Extra shortcode parameters](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/contextual-related-posts-shortcode/): Additional parameters for the shortcode that allow you to customize the output of the related posts list.
* [Additional Metabox settings](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/contextual-related-posts-metabox/): Additional settings in the post edit screen that allow you to customize the related posts output for each post.

#### mySQL FULLTEXT indices

On activation, the plugin creates three mySQL FULLTEXT indices (or indexes), which are leveraged to find the related posts in the `*_posts`. These are for `post_content`, `post_title` and `(post_title,post_content)`. The Pro version also has an index for `post_excerpt`.

If you’re running a multisite installation, this is created for each blog on activation. All these indices occupy space in your mySQL database but are essential for running the plugin.

Two options on the settings page allow you to remove these indices when you deactivate or delete the plugin. The latter is true by default.

You can turn off contextual matching on the settings page if you do not wish to use these indices. You must turn on related posts by category, tags and/or custom taxonomies.

#### GDPR

Contextual Related Posts is GDPR compliant as it doesn’t collect personal data about your visitors when installed out of the box. All posts are processed on your site and not sent to any external service.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT YOU MEET ALL GDPR REQUIREMENTS ON YOUR WEBSITE.

Runs locally on your server instead of calling out to a cloud service. Highly configurable, privacy-friendly, can show thumbnails or just titles, can cache results or calculate them on the fly. Comparable to YARPP, which is also good, but this one comes up with better results on my site.

As a non-tech-savvy person, I was unable to set up the plugin as I needed, so I quickly uninstalled it. Minutes later, Ajay reached out to me with a warm, personal email offering assistance to get the plugin working for me.
With just a couple of custom code lines, the related posts on my blog now look exactly as I imagined. I couldn’t be happier with the professional and warm support from the plugin author.
Thank you, and keep creating amazing products!

I was using a different plug in and it stopped working/indexing my blog posts. I raised a support ticket but after five days no reply so I started looking around for a replacement. I tried two other plug ins before this one and once I figured out how to use some css to centralise it it looks exactly the same as the old plugin did. When I looked at my Google Analytics my page views have shot up, basically because this plug in doesn’t just show “hey here are more posts on my blog…” it shows contextualised related posts so more of what that visitor was looking at in the first place. My page views have shot up. I’m glad the previous plug in stopped working or I would never have found this one.

I noticed that, with the most recent upgrade, my manual related posts were not working correctly. I contacted support on the WP site and received a quick response from Ajay. After a few back and forth questions and answers, he realized that there was a bug and fixed it the next day. On a weekend no less! A+++

Great plugin. Yours is the best related posts plugin I’ve found, and I’ve tried a lot.
If I could request one feature, perhaps in the pro version, the ability to show only related posts within the same post type.
