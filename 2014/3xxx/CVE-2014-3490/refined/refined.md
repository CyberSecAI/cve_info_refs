  "CVE-2014-3490": {
    "Description": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external parameter entities were not disabled when the resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false. A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0818, failing to disable external parameter entities when resteasy.document.expand.entity.references is false.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read files accessible to the application server user, and potentially perform other advanced XXE attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint.",
    "Additional Details": [
        "The vulnerability was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.",
        "The issue is related to the RESTEasy framework, and affects several Red Hat products including JBoss EAP, Data Grid, and Fuse Service Works.",
        "A fix involves disabling the expansion of external XML parameter entities when the `resteasy.document.expand.entity.references` parameter is set to `false`"
