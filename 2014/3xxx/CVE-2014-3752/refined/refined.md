{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in the MiniIcpt.sys device driver allows a local attacker to control the memory location being decremented.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The driver does not properly validate the input buffer, allowing an attacker to control the memory location pointed to by EAX during a decrement operation.",
      "The IOCTL 0x83170180 allows writing to any writable memory via a decrement operation, and therefore the vulnerability can be triggered multiple times."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM. While the attacker requires administrator rights to trigger the bug, by repeatedly decrementing a value in memory, a pointer can be manipulated to eventually control the EIP (instruction pointer), resulting in code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by sending a specially crafted IOCTL to the vulnerable driver.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrator rights on the local machine."
