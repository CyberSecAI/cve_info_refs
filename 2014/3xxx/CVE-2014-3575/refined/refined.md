{
  "CVE-2014-3575": {
    "description": "The exposure exploits the way OLE previews are generated to embed arbitrary file data into a specially crafted document when it is opened. Data exposure is possible if the updated document is distributed to other parties.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how OLE previews are generated within LibreOffice and OpenOffice, allowing for the embedding of arbitrary file data into specially crafted documents.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of OLE objects leading to arbitrary file inclusion",
	   "Lack of proper input validation during OLE object preview generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Data exposure by embedding arbitrary file data into a document. If the updated, malicious document is shared, it can expose sensitive data to other parties.",
    "attack_vector": "A crafted document containing a malicious OLE object is distributed to the victim, who then opens it. The data is exposed when the victim updates the links and the malicious document is redistributed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious document with a special OLE object."
  }
