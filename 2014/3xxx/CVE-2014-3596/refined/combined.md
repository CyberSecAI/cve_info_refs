## Issue

In late 2012, a [research paper](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.utexas.edu%2F%7Eshmat%2Fshmat_ccs12.pdf) was published, showing that several commonly used libraries that handledSSL connections failed to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's CN or subjectAltName field of the x.509 certificate. Apache Axis 1 was one of these libraries, and the issue in Axis 1 was identified by [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784).

While reviewing the patch in August 2014, engineers from Red Hat Product Security noticed that the fix for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject. This new issue is identified by [CVE-2014-3596](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3596).

Note that Axis 1 has reached its end-of-life (EOL) upstream, and the incomplete patch for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was never merged upstream. It was, however, shipped by various vendors, including Debian and Red Hat.

## Resolution

Red Hat is currently working on patches for all affected products as a high priority.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c0)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 03:27:37 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c1)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 03:31:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  Note that Axis 1 is EOL upstream, and the incomplete patch for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was never merged upstream. It was, however, shipped by various vendors, including Debian and Red Hat. Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1164433>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by David Jorm and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c3)  David Jorm    2014-08-19 00:46:17 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2905>  Proposed upstream patch:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12662672/CVE-2014-3596.patch>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-27 12:44:16 UTC  ``` The original issue [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was tracked via [bug 873252](show_bug.cgi?id=873252 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5784 axis: missing connection hostname check against X.509 certificate name").  This problem is similar to Apache HttpComponents Client / Apache/Jakarta Commons HttpClient issue [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577), see [bug 1129074 comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c23 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3577 Apache HttpComponents client / Apache CXF: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-6153 fix") for technical details.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-04 09:52:21 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was discovered that Axis incorrectly extracted the host name from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-15 15:40:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:1193 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1193.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-05-14 15:14:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Portal 6.2.0  Via RHSA-2015:1010 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1010.html>   ``` |  |

# CVE-2014-3596

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-3595.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-3597.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-3596 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3596)

#### Description

The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784.

Message-ID: <53F4217A.203@redhat.com>

Subject: CVE-2014-3596 - Apache Axis 1 vulnerable to MITM attack

Hi All

I noticed that the fix for CVE-2012-5784 was incomplete. The code added
to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the
subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid
certificate using a specially crafted subject.

Note that Axis 1 is EOL upstream, and the incomplete patch for
CVE-2012-5784 was never merged upstream. It was, however, shipped by
various vendors, including Debian and Red Hat. I do not believe Axis 2
is affected.

The incomplete patch:

<https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12560257/CVE-2012-5784-2.patch>

Is attached to this issue:

<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2883>

The flaw exists in the getCN(String) method. An attacker could craft a
subject that includes a CN in a field other than the CN, and this CN
would be used when validating the hostname.

Since Axis 1 is EOL upstream, I have assigned CVE-2014-3596 to this
issue from the Red Hat CNA. I have now made this issue public:

<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3596>

An upstream bug, along with a proposed patch, is available here:

<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2905>

Thanks

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c0)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 03:27:37 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c1)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 03:31:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  Note that Axis 1 is EOL upstream, and the incomplete patch for [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was never merged upstream. It was, however, shipped by various vendors, including Debian and Red Hat. Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1164433>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by David Jorm and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c3)  David Jorm    2014-08-19 00:46:17 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2905>  Proposed upstream patch:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12662672/CVE-2014-3596.patch>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-27 12:44:16 UTC  ``` The original issue [CVE-2012-5784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5784) was tracked via [bug 873252](show_bug.cgi?id=873252 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5784 axis: missing connection hostname check against X.509 certificate name").  This problem is similar to Apache HttpComponents Client / Apache/Jakarta Commons HttpClient issue [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577), see [bug 1129074 comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c23 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3577 Apache HttpComponents client / Apache CXF: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-6153 fix") for technical details.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1129935#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-04 09:52:21 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was discovered that Axis incorrectly extracted the host name from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2012-5783.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2012-5829.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2012-5784 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5784)

#### Description

Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2627487.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1134598#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-05-09 13:32:20 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-5784  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2012-5784 to the following vulnerability:  Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.  CVE-2014-3596  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5784 was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.

#### Description

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5784 was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.
