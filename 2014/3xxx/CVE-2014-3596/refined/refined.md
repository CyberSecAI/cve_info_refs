  "CVE-2014-3596": {
    "description": "The fix for CVE-2012-5784 in Apache Axis 1.x was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.",
    "root_cause": "The getCN(String) method in Apache Axis incorrectly extracts the host name from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field by not verifying if the CN field is the actual CN field, or is a CN located in some other field in the subject.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of the hostname from an X.509 certificate's subject's CN field.",
      "Incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5784"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack, spoofing an SSL server by using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. This could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned between the client and the server to intercept and modify network traffic. The attacker must also be able to generate a specially crafted X.509 certificate with a forged subject."
