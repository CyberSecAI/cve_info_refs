  "CVE-2014-3622": {
    "description": "The new Post Handler in PHP 5.6.0 is doing something dangerous.  add_post_var() has code that does not copy the value of the POST parameter before passing it to the input filter.  Input filters are allowed to change the value that is supplied to them.  If the called input filter frees the value, it will result in an illegal efree() and a potentially exploitable remote code execution issue. However currently I am not aware of anything using input filters except for ext/filter and suhosin, and these are not doing anything to the value.",
