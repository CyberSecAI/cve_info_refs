Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the `command_port_read_callback` function within the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver (`drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c`). This function has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Multiple buffer overflows:** Specifically, the `command_port_read_callback` function contains several flaws in its bounds checking that can lead to buffer overflows.
- The driver does not properly validate the size of data received from specially crafted USB devices when handling bulk responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, the vulnerability may allow for arbitrary code execution by a physically proximate attacker.
- **Memory corruption:** Exploiting these flaws can also result in memory corruption and system instability

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physically Proximate Attack:** The attack requires physical access to the target system to attach a specially crafted USB device to a system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Physical Access:** An attacker must be in the vicinity of the target system to plug in the malicious USB device.
-   **Crafted USB Device:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a USB device and control the data that it transmits to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted device providing a large amount of EHCI or XHCI data associated with a bulk response to the vulnerable driver.

**Affected Components:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB Serial driver.
- Specifically affects the `command_port_read_callback` function
- The vulnerability was found in Linux kernels prior to 3.16.2.

**Specific Software Versions:**
- Ubuntu 10.04 (linux-image-2.6.32-371-ec2)
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3 (kernel-default >= 3.0.101-0.35.1)
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 12 (kernel-default >= 3.12.28-4.6)
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1-LTSS, 11 SP2-LTSS, 11 SP3, 11 SP4
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, 12 SP1
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 11 SP3 (kernel-rt >= 3.0.101.rt130-0.24.1)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7
- openSUSE

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by patching the affected kernel modules and introducing proper bounds checks, as seen in the provided diff from `drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c`.
- Updating to the patched kernel versions is the recommended mitigation.

**Note**:
-  Some vendors declared this issue as a "won't fix" for some of their products due to their respective product lifecycles.
- This vulnerability requires local physical access.
