Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-3848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The iMember360 WordPress plugin versions 3.8.012 through 3.9.001 contain several vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and permission checks on various $_GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** The `i4w_dbinfo` parameter, when set in the URL, would output the full database credentials, including database name, user, password, and encoding. After version 3.9.001, this vulnerability requires the user to access an admin URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `decrypt` and `encrypt` parameters would print verbatim any content passed to them, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** By setting `i4w_clearuser` and `Email` parameters, an attacker could delete an arbitrary user from the WordPress database if the `i4w_clearuser` parameter matched the plugin's API key, which is null if the plugin is not activated.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `i4w_trace` parameter passes unsanitized input to the system shell. This allows for arbitrary code execution if an administrator visits a crafted link with the parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** Allows attackers to gain access to the database, potentially leading to further compromise of the website and its data.
*   **XSS:** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to phishing attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** Allows attackers to delete user accounts, potentially disrupting the website's functionality or damaging user data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full control of the server and complete website takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors for all listed vulnerabilities involve manipulating the URL by appending specific $_GET parameters with malicious values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Credentials Disclosure:** Requires the attacker to send a crafted URL request. After version 3.9.001, requires the user to access an admin URL.
*   **XSS:** Requires the attacker to send a crafted URL request.
*   **Arbitrary User Deletion:** Requires the attacker to know or guess the target user's login name. If the plugin is not activated, the attacker can delete any user.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Requires the attacker to convince an administrator to click on a crafted URL while logged into the admin panel.
