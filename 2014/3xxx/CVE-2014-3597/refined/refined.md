  "description": "Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way PHP parsed DNS responses. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use these flaws to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a PHP application that uses the dns_get_record() function. (CVE-2014-4049, CVE-2014-3597)\n\nThe CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by David Kut√°lek of Red Hat BaseOS QE.\n\nMultiple buffer over-reads in the php_parserr function in ext/standard/dns.c in PHP before 5.4.32 and 5.5.x before 5.5.16 allow remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS record, related to the dns_get_record function and the dn_expand function. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4049.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `php_parserr` function within `ext/standard/dns.c` due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2014-4049. This function is used to parse DNS responses, and incorrect handling of DNS record lengths can lead to buffer over-reads during the processing of the DNS responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of the buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (application crash). It may also lead to arbitrary code execution under the privileges of the vulnerable PHP application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote DNS server",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with a malicious DNS server or with the ability to perform MITM attacks on DNS requests to insert a crafted DNS response can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "required_position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted DNS response to the vulnerable PHP application. This can be achieved by controlling a DNS server that the application uses or by intercepting the DNS requests between the application and the intended server."
