## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel's

magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. ([CVE-2014-3181](/security/CVE-2014-3181))

A bounds check error was discovered in the driver for the Logitech Unifying

receivers and devices. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to to cause a denial of service (invalid kfree) or to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-3182](/security/CVE-2014-3182))

Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the

Linux kernel's HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit

these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a

specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3184](/security/CVE-2014-3184))

Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in

the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate

attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system

crash) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3185](/security/CVE-2014-3185))

Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's PicoLCD

HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code via a specially craft device. ([CVE-2014-3186](/security/CVE-2014-3186))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some

CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause

CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can

cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption).

([CVE-2014-6410](/security/CVE-2014-6410))

James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the

Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other

unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. ([CVE-2014-6416](/security/CVE-2014-6416))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation

failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified

other impact. ([CVE-2014-6417](/security/CVE-2014-6417))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth

replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2014-6418](/security/CVE-2014-6418))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-70-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-70.105](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-70.105)

  -
  [3.2.0-70.105](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-70.105)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-70-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-70.105](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-70.105)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-70-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-70.105](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-70.105)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

```
The report passed to us from transport driver could potentially be
arbitrarily large, therefore we better sanity-check it so that
magicmouse_emit_touch() gets only valid values of raw_id.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# USN-2377-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

9 October 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel's

magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. ([CVE-2014-3181](/security/CVE-2014-3181))

A bounds check error was discovered in the driver for the Logitech Unifying

receivers and devices. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to to cause a denial of service (invalid kfree) or to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-3182](/security/CVE-2014-3182))

Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the

Linux kernel's HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit

these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a

specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3184](/security/CVE-2014-3184))

Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in

the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate

attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system

crash) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3185](/security/CVE-2014-3185))

Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's PicoLCD

HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code via a specially craft device. ([CVE-2014-3186](/security/CVE-2014-3186))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some

CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause

CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can

cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption).

([CVE-2014-6410](/security/CVE-2014-6410))

James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the

Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other

unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. ([CVE-2014-6416](/security/CVE-2014-6416))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation

failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified

other impact. ([CVE-2014-6417](/security/CVE-2014-6417))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth

replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2014-6418](/security/CVE-2014-6418))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1455-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1455.75](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1455.75)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel's

magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. ([CVE-2014-3181](/security/CVE-2014-3181))

Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the

Linux kernel's HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit

these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a

specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3184](/security/CVE-2014-3184))

Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in

the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate

attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system

crash) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3185](/security/CVE-2014-3185))

Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's PicoLCD

HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code via a specially craft device. ([CVE-2014-3186](/security/CVE-2014-3186))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's associative-array garbage

collection implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact

by using keyctl operations. ([CVE-2014-3631](/security/CVE-2014-3631))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some

CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause

CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can

cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption).

([CVE-2014-6410](/security/CVE-2014-6410))

James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the

Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other

unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. ([CVE-2014-6416](/security/CVE-2014-6416))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation

failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified

other impact. ([CVE-2014-6417](/security/CVE-2014-6417))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth

replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2014-6418](/security/CVE-2014-6418))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-37.64~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-37.64~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-37.64~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-37.64~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel's

magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. ([CVE-2014-3181](/security/CVE-2014-3181))

Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the

Linux kernel's HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit

these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a

specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3184](/security/CVE-2014-3184))

Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in

the Linux kernel's Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate

attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system

crash) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3185](/security/CVE-2014-3185))

Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's PicoLCD

HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code via a specially craft device. ([CVE-2014-3186](/security/CVE-2014-3186))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's associative-array garbage

collection implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact

by using keyctl operations. ([CVE-2014-3631](/security/CVE-2014-3631))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some

CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause

CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can

cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption).

([CVE-2014-6410](/security/CVE-2014-6410))

James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the

Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other

unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. ([CVE-2014-6416](/security/CVE-2014-6416))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation

failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified

other impact. ([CVE-2014-6417](/security/CVE-2014-6417))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth

replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2014-6418](/security/CVE-2014-6418))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
OOPS) via a crafted device (bnc#835839).
\* CVE-2013-2929: The Linux kernel before 3.12.2 did not properly use
the get\_dumpable function, which allowed local users to bypass
intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from
IA64 scratch registers via a crafted application, related to
kernel/ptrace.c and arch/ia64/include/asm/processor.h (bnc#847652).
\* CVE-2013-7263: The Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates certain length
values before ensuring that associated data structures have been
initialized, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2)
recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system call, related to net/ipv4/ping.c,
net/ipv4/raw.c, net/ipv4/udp.c, net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c
(bnc#857643).

\* CVE-2014-3601: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages
during the handling of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS
users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption)
or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn
value or (2) cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption)
by triggering a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned
pages (bnc#892782).
\* CVE-2014-3610: The WRMSR processing functionality in the KVM
subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 did not properly handle
the writing of a non-canonical address to a model-specific register,
which allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS
crash) by leveraging guest OS privileges, related to the
wrmsr\_interception function in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c and the
handle\_wrmsr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c (bnc#899192).
\* CVE-2014-3646: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux

3.17.2 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system
crash) via a malformed ASCONF chunk, related to
net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c and net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902346).
\* CVE-2014-3687: The sctp\_assoc\_lookup\_asconf\_ack function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(panic) via duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork
within the side-effect interpreter (bnc#902349).
\* CVE-2014-3688: The SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel before
3.17.4 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) by triggering a large number of chunks in an
associations output queue, as demonstrated by ASCONF probes, related
to net/sctp/inqueue.c and net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902351).
\* CVE-2014-3690: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel processors did not ensure that the
value in the CR4 control register remains the same after a VM entry,
which allowed host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a
denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access,
as demonstrated by PR\_SET\_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of
QEMU (bnc#902232).
\* CVE-2014-4608: Multiple integer overflows in the
lzo1x\_decompress\_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x\_decompress\_safe.c in
the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allowed
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted Literal Run (bnc#883948).
\* CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allowed local users to gain privileges
by leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and
an inet socket (bnc#887082).
\* CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry
that has a CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a self-referential CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-7826: kernel/trace/trace\_syscalls.c in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 did not properly handle private syscall numbers
during use of the ftrace subsystem, which allowed local users to
gain privileges or cause a denial of service (invalid pointer
dereference) via a crafted application (bnc#904013).
\* CVE-2014-7841: The sctp\_process\_param function in
net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4, when ASCONF is used, allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) via a malformed INIT chunk (bnc#905100).
\* CVE-2014-7842: Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4 allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of
service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application that performs an
MMIO transaction or a PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace
emulation error report, a similar issue to CVE-2010-5313
(bnc#905312).
\* CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in
arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18 uses an
improper paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which made
it easier for guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism
via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value (bnc#909078).
\* CVE-2014-8369: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 miscalculates the number of pages
during the handling of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS
privileges. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect
fix for CVE-2014-3601 (bnc#902675).
\* CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.17.2 did not properly maintain the semantics of
rename\_lock, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(deadlock and system hang) via a crafted application (bnc#903640).
\* CVE-2014-8709: The ieee80211\_fragment function in net/mac80211/tx.c
in the Linux kernel before 3.13.5 did not properly maintain a
certain tail pointer, which allowed remote attackers to obtain
sensitive cleartext information by reading packets (bnc#904700).
\* CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not validate a
length value in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field,
which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image (bnc#912654).
\* CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.18.2 did not properly choose memory locations
for the vDSO area, which made it easier for local users to bypass
the ASLR protection mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a
PMD (bnc#912705).

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Enterprise MRG Realtime packages that fix multiple security
issues and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG
2.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Realtime provides the highest levels of predictability for consistent
low-latency response times to meet the needs of time-sensitive workloads.
MRG Realtime also provides new levels of determinism by optimizing lengthy
kernel code paths to ensure that they do not become bottlenecks. This
allows for better prioritization of applications, resulting in consistent,
predictable response times for high-priority applications.

* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the Apple Magic

Mouse/Trackpad multi-touch driver handled Human Interface Device (HID)
reports with an invalid size. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate
their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-3181, Moderate)

* A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech

WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request
Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2014-3185, Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2),

madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other while
operating on virtual memory file system files. A local user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4171, Moderate)

* A stack overflow flaw caused by infinite recursion was found in the way

the Linux kernel's Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system implementation
processed indirect Information Control Blocks (ICBs). An attacker with
physical access to the system could use a specially crafted UDF image to
crash the system. (CVE-2014-6410, Low)

* An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the Logitech Unifying

receiver driver handled HID reports with an invalid device\_index value.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash
the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-3182, Low)

* Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry

Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device
drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote
control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID reports
with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with physical access to
the system could use either of these flaws to write data past an allocated
memory buffer. (CVE-2014-3184, Low)

* It was found that the parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal() function of the

Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* The Solarflare SFC9120 10GBE Ethernet NICs were not supported by the MRG

Realtime kernel. With this update, the drivers have been updated to enable
the Solarflare SFC9120 cards on the Realtime kernel. (BZ#1086945)

All Red Hat Enterprise MRG Realtime users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues
and add this enhancement.
