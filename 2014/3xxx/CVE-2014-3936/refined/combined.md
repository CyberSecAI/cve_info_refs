How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SAP10029

DIR-505 / DIR-505L / DAP-1320 - All Revisions - Stack Overflow - Command Bypass - Information Disclosure - (FW: 1.07 and older / 1.01 and older)

**Publication ID:** SAP10029

**Resolved Status:** Partial

**Published on:** 23 May 2014 5:19 GMT

**Last updated on:** 17 July 2014 4:54 GMT

**Update - May 23, 2014 - 10:15AP PST - Update**

D-Link has been made aware the author of the original disclosure has release additional information regarding further vulnerabilities @ [Link](http://www.devttys0.com/2014/05/hacking-the-dspw215-again/).

The new report will require a new advisory post. We still encourage the end-user to update to this fimrware till a fix for the new report has been released.

**Overview**

The DIR-505 / DIR-5050L Rev. Ax contains a flaw that allows *a malicious user to cause an overflow (halt in executing application) in the device software that allows access to it's operating system and allows unauthenticated commands to be executied.*

**References**

Craig @ /dev/ttyS0 - [Link](http://www.devttys0.com/2014/05/hacking-the-d-link-dsp-w215-smart-plug/)  (This article is for D-Link DSP-W215, please refer to bottom of article on it source "Incidentally, D-Link’s DIR-505 & DIR-505L travel routers is also affected by this bug, as it has a nearly identical my\_cgi.cgi binary.")

**Description**

In order to maintain author's intent and accuracy of the disclosure please read at:  [Link](http://www.devttys0.com/2014/05/hacking-the-d-link-dsp-w215-smart-plug/) (This article is for D-Link DSP-W215, please refer to bottom of article on it source "Incidentally, D-Link’s [DIR-505L](http://www.dlink.com/us/en/home-solutions/connect/routers/dir-505l-shareport-mobile-companion) travel router is also affected by this bug, as it has a nearly identical my\_cgi.cgi binary.")

The author discovered the exploits by inspecting the firmware and recognizing how the mobile applications utilizes the Home Network Administration Protocol ([HNAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Network_Administration_Protocol)) to configure the smart plug.

By accessing the device application for the plug through the HNAP protocol, a malicious user can access device infomation unauthenticated. Once this information is disclosed an exploit can be pushed to the device crashing the application and providing the malicious user access to the core operating system to perform further exploits.  This can lead to the device being reconfigured and/or unstable.

Since the product is an application on the LAN-side of your Home network, the malicious user would have to have exploted the home network or have direct access to the network the device is located.

**Affected Product**

> | Model Name | HW Version | Current FW Version | New FW Version for this exploit fix |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | DAP-1320 | Ax | v. 1.02b07 and older | FW: 1.21b01  Release Notes: Link |
> | DIR-505 | Ax | v. 1.07 and older | FW: 1.08b10  Release Notes: Link |
> | DIR-505L | Ax | v. 1.01 and older | FW: Pending |

**Security patch for your D-Link Devices**

These firmware updates address the security vulnerabilities in affected D-Link devices. D-Link will update this continually and we strongly recommend all users to install the relevant updates.

As there are different hardware revisions on our products, please check this on your device before downloading the correct corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision information can usually be found on the product label on the underside of the product next to the serial number. Alternatively, they can also be found on the device web configuration.

DSP-W215 - Rev. A1 - Stack Overflow - Command Bypass - Information Disclosure- (FW 1.02 and Older)

**Publication ID:** SAP10027

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 15 May 2014 10:04 GMT

**Last updated on:** 11 August 2014 10:22 GMT

**Overview**

The DSP-W215 Rev. A1 contains a flaw that allows *a malicious user to cause an overflow (halt in executing application) in the device software that allows access to it's operating system and allows unauthenticated commands to be executied.*

**This product was released in May 2014. The mobile application required to install and use the device, wll notify the user to upgrade immediately upon patches being available.**

The author discovered the exploits by inspecting the firmware and recognizing how the mobile applications utilizes the Home Network Administration Protocol ([HNAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Network_Administration_Protocol)) to configure the smart plug.

By accessing the device application for the plug through the HNAP protocol, a malicious user can access device infomation unauthenticated. Once this information is disclosed an exploit can be pushed to the device crashing the application and providing the malicious user access to the core operating system to perform further exploits.  This can lead to the device being reconfigured and/or unstable.

Since the product is an application on the LAN-side of your Home network, the malicious user would have to have exploted the home network or have direct access to the network the device is located.

This device does not utilize a web-base configuration interface, it is dependent on the mobile applications which we encourage you use for updates. In the event you would like to manually update the product, a link below is available with the new firmware. To upgrade manually, does require significant technical skill using the provided instructions.  Our technical support call centers will not be able to help you with manual upgrades, only with mobile applicaton upgrades should you need help.

Due to the nature of the attack(s) described by the author and the rootkit provided by the disclosure. As the author had commented the vulnerabilities would require access to the LAN till the most recent disclosure taking advantage of a CSRF vulnerability.
