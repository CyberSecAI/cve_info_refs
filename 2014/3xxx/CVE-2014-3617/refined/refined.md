Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-3617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Moodle Q&A forum module. Specifically, the names of authors who had posted in a Q&A forum were being revealed to users before those users had submitted their own required answers. This was happening when the `/mod/forum/view.php` page was accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of identity information (author names) prematurely. This violates the intended privacy and access control of the Q&A forum where users should not see previous posts until they post their own answer.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The forum was not properly enforcing the rule that only after answering, a student should see names of other authors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Minor Privacy Breach:** The impact is considered "Minor". The revealed information is limited to the author's names. It doesn't expose sensitive data like answers, user profiles, or passwords.
- **Compromised Q&A Functionality:** The vulnerability undermines the Q&A forum's design, which intends to prevent users from seeing others' posts (and their authors) before making their own contribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by simply accessing the `/mod/forum/view.php` page for a Q&A forum, where the user has not yet posted an answer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Normal User:** Any user with access to a Moodle Q&A forum is able to exploit this flaw. No special privileges or technical expertise are required.

**Versions Affected:**

- Moodle versions 2.7 to 2.7.1
- Moodle versions 2.6 to 2.6.4
- Moodle versions 2.5 to 2.5.7
- Earlier unsupported versions

**Versions Fixed:**

- Moodle 2.7.2
- Moodle 2.6.5
- Moodle 2.5.8

**Additional Details:**
The fix involved modifying the forum display logic to ensure that the last poster's name is only outputted if the current user has submitted their answer. The commit history also includes whitespace fixes related to this change.
