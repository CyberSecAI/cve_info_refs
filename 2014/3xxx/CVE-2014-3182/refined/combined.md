[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1318)

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Enterprise MRG Realtime packages that fix multiple security
issues and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG
2.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Realtime provides the highest levels of predictability for consistent
low-latency response times to meet the needs of time-sensitive workloads.
MRG Realtime also provides new levels of determinism by optimizing lengthy
kernel code paths to ensure that they do not become bottlenecks. This
allows for better prioritization of applications, resulting in consistent,
predictable response times for high-priority applications.

* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the Apple Magic

Mouse/Trackpad multi-touch driver handled Human Interface Device (HID)
reports with an invalid size. An attacker with physical access to the
system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate
their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-3181, Moderate)

* A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech

WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request
Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use
this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
the system. (CVE-2014-3185, Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2),

madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other while
operating on virtual memory file system files. A local user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-4171, Moderate)

* A stack overflow flaw caused by infinite recursion was found in the way

the Linux kernel's Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system implementation
processed indirect Information Control Blocks (ICBs). An attacker with
physical access to the system could use a specially crafted UDF image to
crash the system. (CVE-2014-6410, Low)

* An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the Logitech Unifying

receiver driver handled HID reports with an invalid device\_index value.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash
the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-3182, Low)

* Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry

Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device
drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote
control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID reports
with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with physical access to
the system could use either of these flaws to write data past an allocated
memory buffer. (CVE-2014-3184, Low)

* It was found that the parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal() function of the

Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* The Solarflare SFC9120 10GBE Ethernet NICs were not supported by the MRG

Realtime kernel. With this update, the drivers have been updated to enable
the Solarflare SFC9120 cards on the Realtime kernel. (BZ#1086945)

All Red Hat Enterprise MRG Realtime users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues
and add this enhancement.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141391#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2014-09-13 00:35:05 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Human Interface Device(HID) Bus support(CONFIG_HID) along with a driver for   Cherry Cymotion keyboard support(CONFIG_HID_CHERRY)  KYE/Genius devices support(CONFIG_HID_KYE)  Logitech devices support(CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH)  Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard support(CONFIG_HID_MONTEREY)  Petalynx Maxter remote control support(CONFIG_HID_PETALYNX)  Sunplus wireless desktop support(CONFIG_HID_SUNPLUS)  is vulnerable to an OOB write flaw. It could occur if an HID device report offers an invalid report descriptor size.  A local user with physical access to the system could use this flaw to write past an allocated memory buffer. This is mostly a non issue as the allocated memory buffer comes with the padding bytes used for alignment purposes.

USB: fix build error with CONFIG\_PM\_RUNTIME disabled
commit a9ef803d740bfadf5e505fbc57efa57692e27025 upstream.
commit bdd405d2a528 ("usb: hub: Prevent hub autosuspend if
usbcore.autosuspend is -1") causes a build error if CONFIG\_PM\_RUNTIME is
disabled. Fix that by doing a simple #ifdef guard around it.

vm\_is\_stack: use for\_each\_thread() rather then buggy while\_each\_thread()

Aleksei hit the soft lockup during reading /proc/PID/smaps. David
investigated the problem and suggested the right fix.
while\_each\_thread() is racy and should die, this patch updates

NFSv4: Fix problems with close in the presence of a delegation
commit aee7af356e151494d5014f57b33460b162f181b5 upstream.
In the presence of delegations, we can no longer assume that the
state->n\_rdwr, state->n\_rdonly, state->n\_wronly reflect the open
stateid share mode, and so we need to calculate the initial value
for calldata->arg.fmode using the state->flags.

commit 412f6c4c26fb1eba8844290663837561ac53fa6e upstream.
If we did an OPEN\_DOWNGRADE, then the right thing to do on success, is
to apply the new open mode to the struct nfs4\_state. Instead, we were
unconditionally clearing the state, making it appear to our state
machinery as if we had just performed a CLOSE.

commit f87d928f6d98644d39809a013a22f981d39017cf upstream.
When creating a new object on the NFS server, we should not be sending
posix setacl requests unless the preceding posix\_acl\_create returned a
non-trivial acl. Doing so, causes Solaris servers in particular to
return an EINVAL.

a 4.1 mount is attempted with RDMA, the server panics in the TCP BC
code when trying to send CB\_NULL.
Instead, construct the transport protocol number from the forward
channel transport or'd with XPRT\_TRANSPORT\_BC. Transports that do
not support bi-directional RPC will not have registered a "BC"
transport, causing create\_backchannel\_client() to fail immediately.

nfs3\_list\_one\_acl(): check get\_acl() result with IS\_ERR\_OR\_NULL
commit 7a9e75a185e6b3a3860e6a26fb6e88691fc2c9d9 upstream.
There was a check for result being not NULL. But get\_acl() may return
NULL, or ERR\_PTR, or actual pointer.
The purpose of the function where current change is done is to "list
ACLs only when they are available", so any error condition of get\_acl()
mustn't be elevated, and returning 0 there is still valid.

usbcore: Fix wrong device in an error message in hub\_port\_connect()
commit dd5f5006d1035547559c8a90781a7e249787a7a2 upstream.
The commit [5ee0f803cc3a: usbcore: don't log on consecutive debounce
failures of the same port] added the check of the reliable port, but
it also replaced the device argument to dev\_err() wrongly, which leads
to a NULL dereference.
This patch restores the right device, port\_dev->dev. Also, since
dev\_err() itself shows the port number, reduce the port number shown
in the error message, essentially reverting to the state before the
commit 5ee0f803cc3a.

ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Rearm wake-up interrupts for DT when MUSB is idled
commit cc824534d4fef0e46e4486d5c1e10d3c6b1ebadc upstream.
Looks like MUSB cable removal can cause wake-up interrupts to
stop working for device tree based booting at least for UART3
even as nothing is dynamically remuxed. This can be fixed by
calling reconfigure\_io\_chain() for device tree based booting
in hwmod code. Note that we already do that for legacy booting
if the legacy mux is configured.
My guess is that this is related to UART3 and MUSB ULPI
hsusb0\_data0 and hsusb0\_data1 support for Carkit mode that
somehow affect the configured IO chain for UART3 and require
rearming the wake-up interrupts.
In general, for device tree based booting, pinctrl-single
calls the rearm hook that in turn calls reconfigure\_io\_chain
so calling reconfigure\_io\_chain should not be needed from the
hwmod code for other events.
So let's limit the hwmod rearming of iochain only to
HWMOD\_FORCE\_MSTANDBY where MUSB is currently the only user
of it. If we see other devices needing similar changes we can
add more checks for it.

xhci: rework cycle bit checking for new dequeue pointers
commit 365038d83313951d6ace15342eb24624bbef1666 upstream.
When we manually need to move the TR dequeue pointer we need to set the
correct cycle bit as well. Previously we used the trb pointer from the
last event received as a base, but this was changed in
commit 1f81b6d22a59 ("usb: xhci: Prefer endpoint context dequeue pointer")
to use the dequeue pointer from the endpoint context instead
It turns out some Asmedia controllers advance the dequeue pointer
stored in the endpoint context past the event triggering TRB, and
this messed up the way the cycle bit was calculated.
Instead of adding a quirk or complicating the already hard to follow cycle bit
code, the whole cycle bit calculation is now simplified and adapted to handle
event and endpoint context dequeue pointer differences.

- letting et131x\_mii\_write() take a phydev address, instead of using the one

- removing implementation of et131x\_mdio\_reset(), as it's not needed.
- moving a call to et131x\_disable\_phy\_coma() in et131x\_pci\_setup(), which uses
phydev->addr, until after the mdiobus has been registered.

jbd2: fix descriptor block size handling errors with journal\_csum
commit db9ee220361de03ee86388f9ea5e529eaad5323c upstream.
It turns out that there are some serious problems with the on-disk
format of journal checksum v2. The foremost is that the function to
calculate descriptor tag size returns sizes that are too big. This
causes alignment issues on some architectures and is compounded by the
fact that some parts of jbd2 use the structure size (incorrectly) to
determine the presence of a 64bit journal instead of checking the
feature flags.
Therefore, introduce journal checksum v3, which enlarges the
descriptor block tag format to allow for full 32-bit checksums of
journal blocks, fix the journal tag function to return the correct
sizes, and fix the jbd2 recovery code to use feature flags to
determine 64bitness.
Add a few function helpers so we don't have to open-code quite so
many pieces.
Switching to a 16-byte block size was found to increase journal size
overhead by a maximum of 0.1%, to convert a 32-bit journal with no
checksumming to a 32-bit journal with checksum v3 enabled.

ext4: fix same-dir rename when inline data directory overflows
commit d80d448c6c5bdd32605b78a60fe8081d82d4da0f upstream.
When performing a same-directory rename, it's possible that adding or
setting the new directory entry will cause the directory to overflow
the inline data area, which causes the directory to be converted to an
extent-based directory. Under this circumstance it is necessary to
re-read the directory when deleting the old dirent because the "old
directory" context still points to i\_block in the inode table, which
is now an extent tree root! The delete fails with an FS error, and
the subsequent fsck complains about incorrect link counts and
hardlinked directories.
Test case (originally found with flat\_dir\_test in the metadata\_csum
test program):
# mkfs.ext4 -O inline\_data /dev/sda
# mount /dev/sda /mnt
# mkdir /mnt/x
# touch /mnt/x/changelog.gz /mnt/x/copyright /mnt/x/README.Debian

Btrfs: fix task hang under heavy compressed write
commit 9e0af23764344f7f1b68e4eefbe7dc865018b63d upstream.
This has been reported and discussed for a long time, and this hang occurs in
both 3.15 and 3.16.
Btrfs now migrates to use kernel workqueue, but it introduces this hang problem.
Btrfs has a kind of work queued as an ordered way, which means that its
ordered\_func() must be processed in the way of FIFO, so it usually looks like --
normal\_work\_helper(arg)
work = container\_of(arg, struct btrfs\_work, normal\_work);
work->func() <---- (we name it work X)
for ordered\_work in wq->ordered\_list
ordered\_work->ordered\_func()
ordered\_work->ordered\_free()
The hang is a rare case, first when we find free space, we get an uncached block
group, then we go to read its free space cache inode for free space information,
so it will
file a readahead request
btrfs\_readpages()
for page that is not in page cache
\_\_do\_readpage()
submit\_extent\_page()
btrfs\_submit\_bio\_hook()
btrfs\_bio\_wq\_end\_io()
submit\_bio()
end\_workqueue\_bio() <--(ret by the 1st endio)
queue a work(named work Y) for the 2nd
also the real endio()
So the hang occurs when work Y's work\_struct and work X's work\_struct happens
to share the same address.
A bit more explanation,
A,B,C -- struct btrfs\_work
arg -- struct work\_struct
kthread:
worker\_thread()
pick up a work\_struct from @worklist
process\_one\_work(arg)
worker->current\_work = arg; <-- arg is A->normal\_work
worker->current\_func(arg)
normal\_work\_helper(arg)
A = container\_of(arg, struct btrfs\_work, normal\_work);
A->func()
A->ordered\_func()
A->ordered\_free() <-- A gets freed
B->ordered\_func()
submit\_compressed\_extents()
find\_free\_extent()
load\_free\_space\_inode()
... <-- (the above readhead stack)
end\_workqueue\_bio()
btrfs\_queue\_work(work C)
B->ordered\_free()
As if work A has a high priority in wq->ordered\_list and there are more ordered
works queued after it, such as B->ordered\_func(), its memory could have been
freed before normal\_work\_helper() returns, which means that kernel workqueue
code worker\_thread() still has worker->current\_work pointer to be work
A->normal\_work's, ie. arg's address.
Meanwhile, work C is allocated after work A is freed, work C->normal\_work
and work A->normal\_work are likely to share the same address(I confirmed this
with ftrace output, so I'm not just guessing, it's rare though).
When another kthread picks up work C->normal\_work to process, and finds our
kthread is processing it(see find\_worker\_executing\_work()), it'll think
work C as a collision and skip then, which ends up nobody processing work C.
So the situation is that our kthread is waiting forever on work C.
Besides, there're other cases that can lead to deadlock, but the real problem
is that all btrfs workqueue shares one work->func, -- normal\_work\_helper,
so this makes each workqueue to have its own helper function, but only a
wraper pf normal\_work\_helper.
With this patch, I no long hit the above hang.

btrfs: disable strict file flushes for renames and truncates
commit 8d875f95da43c6a8f18f77869f2ef26e9594fecc upstream.
Truncates and renames are often used to replace old versions of a file
with new versions. Applications often expect this to be an atomic
replacement, even if they haven't done anything to make sure the new
version is fully on disk.
Btrfs has strict flushing in place to make sure that renaming over an
old file with a new file will fully flush out the new file before
allowing the transaction commit with the rename to complete.
This ordering means the commit code needs to be able to lock file pages,
and there are a few paths in the filesystem where we will try to end a
transaction with the page lock held. It's rare, but these things can
deadlock.
This patch removes the ordered flushes and switches to a best effort
filemap\_flush like ext4 uses. It's not perfect, but it should fix the
deadlocks.

Btrfs: fix csum tree corruption, duplicate and outdated checksums
commit 27b9a8122ff71a8cadfbffb9c4f0694300464f3b upstream.
Under rare circumstances we can end up leaving 2 versions of a checksum
for the same file extent range.
The reason for this is that after calling btrfs\_next\_leaf we process
slot 0 of the leaf it returns, instead of processing the slot set in
path->slots[0]. Most of the time (by far) path->slots[0] is 0, but after
btrfs\_next\_leaf() releases the path and before it searches for the next
leaf, another task might cause a split of the next leaf, which migrates
some of its keys to the leaf we were processing before calling
btrfs\_next\_leaf(). In this case btrfs\_next\_leaf() returns again the
same leaf but with path->slots[0] having a slot number corresponding
to the first new key it got, that is, a slot number that didn't exist
before calling btrfs\_next\_leaf(), as the leaf now has more keys than
it had before. So we must really process the returned leaf starting at
path->slots[0] always, as it isn't always 0, and the key at slot 0 can
have an offset much lower than our search offset/bytenr.
For example, consider the following scenario, where we have:
sums->bytenr: 40157184, sums->len: 16384, sums end: 40173568
four 4kb file data blocks with offsets 40157184, 40161280, 40165376, 40169472
Leaf N:
slot = 0 slot = btrfs\_header\_nritems() - 1
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [(CSUM CSUM 39239680), size 8] ... [(CSUM CSUM 40116224), size 4] |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
Leaf N + 1:
slot = 0 slot = btrfs\_header\_nritems() - 1
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [(CSUM CSUM 40161280), size 32] ... [((CSUM CSUM 40615936), size 8 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
Because we are at the last slot of leaf N, we call btrfs\_next\_leaf() to
find the next highest key, which releases the current path and then searches
for that next key. However after releasing the path and before finding that
next key, the item at slot 0 of leaf N + 1 gets moved to leaf N, due to a call
to ctree.c:push\_leaf\_left() (via ctree.c:split\_leaf()), and therefore
btrfs\_next\_leaf() will returns us a path again with leaf N but with the slot
pointing to its new last key (CSUM CSUM 40161280). This new version of leaf N
is then:
slot = 0 slot = btrfs\_header\_nritems() - 2 slot = btrfs\_header\_nritems() - 1
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [(CSUM CSUM 39239680), size 8] ... [(CSUM CSUM 40116224), size 4] [(CSUM CSUM 40161280), size 32] |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
And incorrecly using slot 0, makes us set next\_offset to 39239680 and we jump
into the "insert:" label, which will set tmp to:
tmp = min((sums->len - total\_bytes) >> blocksize\_bits,
(next\_offset - file\_key.offset) >> blocksize\_bits) =
min((16384 - 0) >> 12, (39239680 - 40157184) >> 12) =
min(4, (u64)-917504 = 18446744073708634112 >> 12) = 4
and
ins\_size = csum\_size \* tmp = 4 \* 4 = 16 bytes.
In other words, we insert a new csum item in the tree with key
(CSUM\_OBJECTID CSUM\_KEY 40157184 = sums->bytenr) that contains the checksums
for all the data (4 blocks of 4096 bytes each = sums->len). Which is wrong,
because the item with key (CSUM CSUM 40161280) (the one that was moved from
leaf N + 1 to the end of leaf N) contains the old checksums of the last 12288
bytes of our data and won't get those old checksums removed.
So this leaves us 2 different checksums for 3 4kb blocks of data in the tree,
and breaks the logical rule:
Key\_N+1.offset >= Key\_N.offset + length\_of\_data\_its\_checksums\_cover
An obvious bad effect of this is that a subsequent csum tree lookup to get
the checksum of any of the blocks with logical offset of 40161280, 40165376
or 40169472 (the last 3 4kb blocks of file data), will get the old checksums.

This indicates a NULL corruption in prefs\_delayed list. The further
investigation and bisection pointed that the call of ulist\_add\_merge()
results in the corruption.
ulist\_add\_merge() takes u64 as aux and writes a 64bit value into
old\_aux. The callers of this function in backref.c, however, pass a
pointer of a pointer to old\_aux. That is, the function overwrites
64bit value on 32bit pointer. This caused a NULL in the adjacent
variable, in this case, prefs\_delayed.
Here is a quick attempt to band-aid over this: a new function,
ulist\_add\_merge\_ptr() is introduced to pass/store properly a pointer
value instead of u64. There are still ugly void \*\* cast remaining
in the callers because void \*\* cannot be taken implicitly. But, it's
safer than explicit cast to u64, anyway.

x86,mm: fix pte\_special versus pte\_numa
commit b38af4721f59d0b564468f623b3e52a638195015 upstream.
Sasha Levin has shown oopses on ffffea0003480048 and ffffea0003480008 at
mm/memory.c:1132, running Trinity on different 3.16-rc-next kernels:
where zap\_pte\_range() checks page->mapping to see if PageAnon(page).
Those addresses fit struct pages for pfns d2001 and d2000, and in each
dump a register or a stack slot showed d2001730 or d2000730: pte flags
0x730 are PCD ACCESSED PROTNONE SPECIAL IOMAP; and Sasha's e820 map has
a hole between cfffffff and 100000000, which would need special access.
Commit c46a7c817e66 ("x86: define \_PAGE\_NUMA by reusing software bits on
the PMD and PTE levels") has broken vm\_normal\_page(): a PROTNONE SPECIAL
pte no longer passes the pte\_special() test, so zap\_pte\_range() goes on
to try to access a non-existent struct page.
Fix this by refining pte\_special() (SPECIAL with PRESENT or PROTNONE) to
complement pte\_numa() (SPECIAL with neither PRESENT nor PROTNONE). A
hint that this was a problem was that c46a7c817e66 added pte\_numa() test
to vm\_normal\_page(), and moved its is\_zero\_pfn() test from slow to fast
path: This was papering over a pte\_special() snag when the zero page was
encountered during zap. This patch reverts vm\_normal\_page() to how it
was before, relying on pte\_special().
It still appears that this patch may be incomplete: aren't there other
places which need to be handling PROTNONE along with PRESENT? For
example, pte\_mknuma() clears \_PAGE\_PRESENT and sets \_PAGE\_NUMA, but on a
PROT\_NONE area, that would make it pte\_special(). This is side-stepped
by the fact that NUMA hinting faults skipped PROT\_NONE VMAs and there
are no grounds where a NUMA hinting fault on a PROT\_NONE VMA would be
interesting.

x86/xen: resume timer irqs early
commit 8d5999df35314607c38fbd6bdd709e25c3a4eeab upstream.
If the timer irqs are resumed during device resume it is possible in
certain circumstances for the resume to hang early on, before device
interrupts are resumed. For an Ubuntu 14.04 PVHVM guest this would
occur in ~0.5% of resume attempts.
It is not entirely clear what is occuring the point of the hang but I
think a task necessary for the resume calls schedule\_timeout(),
waiting for a timer interrupt (which never arrives). This failure may
require specific tasks to be running on the other VCPUs to trigger
(processes are not frozen during a suspend/resume if PREEMPT is
disabled).
Add IRQF\_EARLY\_RESUME to the timer interrupts so they are resumed in
syscore\_resume().

x86/efi: Enforce CONFIG\_RELOCATABLE for EFI boot stub
commit 7b2a583afb4ab894f78bc0f8bd136e96b6499a7e upstream.
Without CONFIG\_RELOCATABLE the early boot code will decompress the
kernel to LOAD\_PHYSICAL\_ADDR. While this may have been fine in the BIOS
days, that isn't going to fly with UEFI since parts of the firmware
code/data may be located at LOAD\_PHYSICAL\_ADDR.
Straying outside of the bounds of the regions we've explicitly requested
from the firmware will cause all sorts of trouble. Bruno reports that
his machine resets while trying to decompress the kernel image.
We already go to great pains to ensure the kernel is loaded into a
suitably aligned buffer, it's just that the address isn't necessarily
LOAD\_PHYSICAL\_ADDR, because we can't guarantee that address isn't in-use
by the firmware.
Explicitly enforce CONFIG\_RELOCATABLE for the EFI boot stub, so that we
can load the kernel at any address with the correct alignment.

xen/events/fifo: ensure all bitops are properly aligned even on x86
commit dcecb8fd93a65787130a74e61fdf29932c8d85eb upstream.
When using the FIFO-based ABI on x86\_64, if the last port is at the
end of an event array page then sync\_test\_bit() on this port's event
word will read beyond the end of the page and in certain circumstances
this may fault.
The fault requires the following page in the kernel's direct mapping
to be not present, which would mean:
a) the array page is the last page of RAM; or
b) the following page is ballooned out /and/ it has been used for a
foreign mapping by a kernel driver (such as netback or blkback)
/and/ the grant has been unmapped.
Use the infrastructure added for arm64 to ensure that all bitops
operating on event words are unsigned long aligned.

x86: MCE: Add raw\_lock conversion again
commit ed5c41d30ef2ce578fd6b6e2f7ec23f2a58b1eba upstream.
Commit ea431643d6c3 ("x86/mce: Fix CMCI preemption bugs") breaks RT by
the completely unrelated conversion of the cmci\_discover\_lock to a
regular (non raw) spinlock. This lock was annotated in commit
59d958d2c7de ("locking, x86: mce: Annotate cmci\_discover\_lock as raw")
with a proper explanation why.
The argument for converting the lock back to a regular spinlock was:
- it does percpu ops without disabling preemption. Preemption is not
disabled due to the mistaken use of a raw spinlock.
Which is complete nonsense. The raw\_spinlock is disabling preemption in
the same way as a regular spinlock. In mainline spinlock maps to
raw\_spinlock, in RT spinlock becomes a "sleeping" lock.
raw\_spinlock has on RT exactly the same semantics as in mainline. And
because this lock is taken in non preemptible context it must be raw on
RT.
Undo the locking brainfart.

hpsa: fix non-x86 builds
commit 0b9e7b741f2bf8103b15bb14d5b4a6f5ee91c59a upstream.
commit 28e134464734 "[SCSI] hpsa: enable unit attention reporting"
turns on unit attention notifications, but got the change wrong for
all architectures other than x86, which now store an uninitialized
value into the device register.
Gcc helpfully warns about this:
../drivers/scsi/hpsa.c: In function 'hpsa\_set\_driver\_support\_bits':
../drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:6373:17: warning: 'driver\_support' is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
driver\_support |= ENABLE\_UNIT\_ATTN;
^
This moves the #ifdef so only the prefetch-enable is conditional
on x86, not also reading the initial register contents.

commit 7340056567e32b2c9d3554eb146e1977c93da116 upstream.
Commit bcdde7e made \_\_sysfs\_remove\_dir() recursive and introduced a BUG\_ON
during PHB removal while attempting to delete the power managment attribute
group of the bus. This is a result of tearing the bridge and bus devices down
out of order in remove\_phb\_dynamic. Since, the the bus resides below the bridge
in the sysfs device tree it should be torn down first.
This patch simply moves the device\_unregister call for the PHB bridge device
after the device\_unregister call for the PHB bus.

powerpc/eeh: Wrong place to call pci\_get\_slot()
commit 9e5c6e5a3be0b2e17ff61b9b74adef4a2c9e6934 upstream.
pci\_get\_slot() is called with hold of PCI bus semaphore and it's not
safe to be called in interrupt context. However, we possibly checks
EEH error and calls the function in interrupt context. To avoid using

x86: don't exclude low BIOS area when allocating address space for non-PCI cards
commit cbace46a9710a480cae51e4611697df5de41713e upstream.
Commit 30919b0bf356 ("x86: avoid low BIOS area when allocating address
space") moved the test for resource allocations that fall within the first
1MB of address space from the PCI-specific path to a generic path, such
that all resource allocations will avoid this area. However, this breaks
ISA cards which need to allocate a memory region within the first 1MB. An
example is the i82365 PCMCIA controller and derivatives like the Ricoh
RF5C296/396 which map part of the PCMCIA socket memory address space into
the first 1MB of system memory address space. They do not work anymore as
no usable memory region exists due to this change:

ACPI / PCI: Fix sysfs acpi\_index and label errors
commit dcfa9be83866e28fcb8b7e22b4eeb4ba63bd3174 upstream.
Fix errors in handling "device label" \_DSM return values.
If \_DSM returns a Unicode string, the ACPI type is ACPI\_TYPE\_BUFFER, not
ACPI\_TYPE\_STRING. Fix dsm\_label\_utf16s\_to\_utf8s() to convert UTF-16 from
acpi\_object->buffer instead of acpi\_object->string.
Prior to v3.14, we accepted Unicode labels (ACPI\_TYPE\_BUFFER return
values). But after 1d0fcef73283, we accepted only ASCII (ACPI\_TYPE\_STRING)
(and we incorrectly tried to convert those ASCII labels from UTF-16 to
UTF-8).
Rejecting Unicode labels made us return -EPERM when reading sysfs
"acpi\_index" or "label" files, which in turn caused on-board network
interfaces on a Dell PowerEdge E420 to be renamed (by udev net\_id internal)
from eno1/eno2 to enp2s0f0/enp2s0f1.
Fix this by accepting either ACPI\_TYPE\_STRING (and treating it as ASCII) or
ACPI\_TYPE\_BUFFER (and converting from UTF-16 to UTF-8).

PCI: pciehp: Clear Data Link Layer State Changed during init
commit 0d25d35c987d7b0b63368d9c1ae35a917e1a7bab upstream.
During PCIe hot-plug initialization - pciehp\_probe() - data structures
related to slot capabilities are set up. As part of this set up, ISRs are
put in place to handle slot events and all event bits are cleared out.
This patch adds the Data Link Layer State Changed (PCI\_EXP\_SLTSTA\_DLLSC)
Slot Status bit to the event bits that are cleared out during
initialization.
If the BIOS doesn't clear DLLSC before handoff to the OS, pciehp notices
that it's set and interprets it as a new Link Up event, which results in
spurious messages:
pciehp 0000:82:04.0:pcie24: slot(4): Link Up event
pciehp 0000:82:04.0:pcie24: Device 0000:83:00.0 already exists at 0000:83:00, cannot hot-add
pciehp 0000:82:04.0:pcie24: Cannot add device at 0000:83:00
Prior to e48f1b67f668 ("PCI: pciehp: Use link change notifications for
hot-plug and removal"), pciehp ignored DLLSC.

PCI: Keep original resource if we fail to expand it

If we have space assigned to a resource, we try to expand the resource

we should keep the original assignment.
After bd064f0a231a ("PCI: Mark resources as IORESOURCE\_UNSET if we can't

expansion failed, even if it had originally been set. That caused errors

PCI: Configure ASPM when enabling device
commit 1f6ae47ecff7f23da73417e068018b311f3b5583 upstream.
We can't do ASPM configuration at enumeration-time because enabling it
makes some defective hardware unresponsive, even if ASPM is disabled later
(see 41cd766b0659 ("PCI: Don't enable aspm before drivers have had a chance
to veto it"). Therefore, we have to do it after a driver claims the
device.
We previously configured ASPM in pci\_set\_power\_state(), but that's not a
very good place because it's not really related to setting the PCI device
power state, and doing it there means:
- We incorrectly skipped ASPM config when setting a device that's
already in D0 to D0.
- We unnecessarily configured ASPM when setting a device to a low-power
state (the ASPM feature only applies when the device is in D0).
- We unnecessarily configured ASPM when called from a .resume() method
(ASPM configuration needs to be restored during resume, but
pci\_restore\_pcie\_state() should already do this).
Move ASPM configuration from pci\_set\_power\_state() to
do\_pci\_enable\_device() so we do it when a driver enables a device.

ext4: fix BUG\_ON in mb\_free\_blocks()
commit c99d1e6e83b06744c75d9f5e491ed495a7086b7b upstream.
If we suffer a block allocation failure (for example due to a memory
allocation failure), it's possible that we will call
ext4\_discard\_allocated\_blocks() before we've actually allocated any
blocks. In that case, fe\_len and fe\_start in ac->ac\_f\_ex will still
be zero, and this will result in mb\_free\_blocks(inode, e4b, 0, 0)
triggering the BUG\_ON on mb\_free\_blocks():
BUG\_ON(last >= (sb->s\_blocksize << 3));
Fix this by bailing out of ext4\_discard\_allocated\_blocks() if fs\_len
is zero.
Also fix a missing ext4\_mb\_unload\_buddy() call in
ext4\_discard\_allocated\_blocks().

kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter of kvm\_iommu\_put\_pages (CVE-2014-3601)
commit 350b8bdd689cd2ab2c67c8a86a0be86cfa0751a7 upstream.
The third parameter of kvm\_iommu\_put\_pages is wrong,
It should be 'gfn - slot->base\_gfn'.
By making gfn very large, malicious guest or userspace can cause kvm to
go to this error path, and subsequently to pass a huge value as size.
Alternatively if gfn is small, then pages would be pinned but never
unpinned, causing host memory leak and local DOS.
Passing a reasonable but large value could be the most dangerous case,
because it would unpin a page that should have stayed pinned, and thus
allow the device to DMA into arbitrary memory. However, this cannot
happen because of the condition that can trigger the error:
- out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page)
should not be possible for the attacker to trigger
- when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn
will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside
kvm\_iommu\_put\_pages() the iommu\_iova\_to\_phys() will fail. The
page thus would not be unpinned at all.

To fix this, we cannot rely on the processor's virtual interrupt delivery,
because "acknowledge interrupt on exit" must only update the virtual
ISR/PPR/IRR registers (and SVI, which is just a cache of the virtual ISR)
but it should not deliver the interrupt through the IDT. Thus, KVM has
to deliver the interrupt "by hand", similar to the treatment of EOI in
commit fc57ac2c9ca8 (KVM: lapic: sync highest ISR to hardware apic on
EOI, 2014-05-14).
The patch modifies kvm\_cpu\_get\_interrupt to always acknowledge an
interrupt; there are only two callers, and the other is not affected
because it is never reached with kvm\_apic\_vid\_enabled() == true. Then it
modifies apic\_set\_isr and apic\_clear\_irr to update SVI and RVI in addition
to the registers.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix LPCR one\_reg interface
commit a0840240c0c6bcbac8f0f5db11f95c19aaf9b52f upstream.
Unfortunately, the LPCR got defined as a 32-bit register in the
one\_reg interface. This is unfortunate because KVM allows userspace
to control the DPFD (default prefetch depth) field, which is in the
upper 32 bits. The result is that DPFD always get set to 0, which
reduces performance in the guest.
We can't just change KVM\_REG\_PPC\_LPCR to be a 64-bit register ID,
since that would break existing userspace binaries. Instead we define
a new KVM\_REG\_PPC\_LPCR\_64 id which is 64-bit. Userspace can still use
the old KVM\_REG\_PPC\_LPCR id, but it now only modifies those fields in
the bottom 32 bits that userspace can modify (ILE, TC and AIL).
If userspace uses the new KVM\_REG\_PPC\_LPCR\_64 id, it can modify DPFD
as well.

KVM: x86: always exit on EOIs for interrupts listed in the IOAPIC redir table
commit 0f6c0a740b7d3e1f3697395922d674000f83d060 upstream.
Currently, the EOI exit bitmap (used for APICv) does not include
interrupts that are masked. However, this can cause a bug that manifests
as an interrupt storm inside the guest. Alex Williamson reported the
bug and is the one who really debugged this; I only wrote the patch. :)
The scenario involves a multi-function PCI device with OHCI and EHCI
USB functions and an audio function, all assigned to the guest, where
both USB functions use legacy INTx interrupts.
As soon as the guest boots, interrupts for these devices turn into an
interrupt storm in the guest; the host does not see the interrupt storm.
Basically the EOI path does not work, and the guest continues to see the
interrupt over and over, even after it attempts to mask it at the APIC.
The bug is only visible with older kernels (RHEL6.5, based on 2.6.32
with not many changes in the area of APIC/IOAPIC handling).
Alex then tried forcing bit 59 (corresponding to the USB functions' IRQ)
on in the eoi\_exit\_bitmap and TMR, and things then work. What happens
is that VFIO asserts IRQ11, then KVM recomputes the EOI exit bitmap.
It does not have set bit 59 because the RTE was masked, so the IOAPIC
never sees the EOI and the interrupt continues to fire in the guest.
My guess was that the guest is masking the interrupt in the redirection
table in the interrupt routine, i.e. while the interrupt is set in a
LAPIC's ISR, The simplest fix is to ignore the masking state, we would
rather have an unnecessary exit rather than a missed IRQ ACK and anyway
IOAPIC interrupts are not as performance-sensitive as for example MSIs.
Alex tested this patch and it fixed his bug.
[Thanks to Alex for his precise description of the problem
and initial debugging effort. A lot of the text above is
based on emails exchanged with him.]

debugfs: Fix corrupted loop in debugfs\_remove\_recursive
commit 485d44022a152c0254dd63445fdb81c4194cbf0e upstream.
[ I'm currently running my tests on it now, and so far, after a few
hours it has yet to blow up. I'll run it for 24 hours which it never
succeeded in the past. ]
The tracing code has a way to make directories within the debugfs file
system as well as deleting them using mkdir/rmdir in the instance
directory. This is very limited in functionality, such as there is
no renames, and the parent directory "instance" can not be modified.
The tracing code creates the instance directory from the debugfs code
and then replaces the dentry->d\_inode->i\_op with its own to allow
for mkdir/rmdir to work.
When these are called, the d\_entry and inode locks need to be released
to call the instance creation and deletion code. That code has its own
accounting and locking to serialize everything to prevent multiple
users from causing harm. As the parent "instance" directory can not
be modified this simplifies things.
I created a stress test that creates several threads that randomly
creates and deletes directories thousands of times a second. The code
stood up to this test and I submitted it a while ago.
Recently I added a new test that adds readers to the mix. While the
instance directories were being added and deleted, readers would read
from these directories and even enable tracing within them. This test
was able to trigger a bug:

It took a while, but every time it triggered, it was always in the
same place:
list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe(child, next, &parent->d\_subdirs, d\_u.d\_child) {
Where the child->d\_u.d\_child seemed to be corrupted. I added lots of
trace\_printk()s to see what was wrong, and sure enough, it was always
the child's d\_u.d\_child field. I looked around to see what touches
it and noticed that in \_\_dentry\_kill() which calls dentry\_free():
static void dentry\_free(struct dentry \*dentry)
{
/\* if dentry was never visible to RCU, immediate free is OK \*/
if (!(dentry->d\_flags & DCACHE\_RCUACCESS))
\_\_d\_free(&dentry->d\_u.d\_rcu);
else
call\_rcu(&dentry->d\_u.d\_rcu, \_\_d\_free);
}
I also noticed that \_\_dentry\_kill() unlinks the child->d\_u.child
under the parent->d\_lock spin\_lock.
Looking back at the loop in debugfs\_remove\_recursive() it never takes the
parent->d\_lock to do the list walk. Adding more tracing, I was able to
prove this was the issue:
ftrace-t-15385 1.... 246662024us : dentry\_kill : free ffff88006d573600
rmdir-15409 2.... 246662024us : debugfs\_remove\_recursive : child=ffff88006d573600 next=dead000000100058
The dentry\_kill freed ffff88006d573600 just as the remove recursive was walking
it.
In order to fix this, the list walk needs to be modified a bit to take
the parent->d\_lock. The safe version is no longer necessary, as every
time we remove a child, the parent->d\_lock must be released and the
list walk must start over. Each time a child is removed, even though it
may still be on the list, it should be skipped by the first check
in the loop:
if (!debugfs\_positive(child))
continue;

crypto: ux500 - make interrupt mode plausible
commit e1f8859ee265fc89bd21b4dca79e8e983a044892 upstream.
The interrupt handler in the ux500 crypto driver has an obviously
incorrect way to access the data buffer, which for a while has
caused this build warning:
../ux500/cryp/cryp\_core.c: In function 'cryp\_interrupt\_handler':

There are at least two, possibly three problems here:
a) when writing into the FIFO, we copy the pointer rather than the
actual data we want to give to the hardware
b) the data pointer is an array of 8-bit values, while the FIFO
is 32-bit wide, so both the read and write access fail to do
a proper type conversion
c) This seems incorrect for big-endian kernels, on which we need to
byte-swap any register access, but not normally FIFO accesses,
at least the DMA case doesn't do it either.
This converts the bogus loop to use the same readsl/writesl pair
that we use for the two other modes (DMA and polling). This is
more efficient and consistent, and probably correct for endianess.
The bug has existed since the driver was first merged, and was
probably never detected because nobody tried to use interrupt mode.
It might make sense to backport this fix to stable kernels, depending
on how the crypto maintainers feel about that.

When a tty is opened for the serial console, the termios c\_cflag
settings are inherited from the console line settings.
However, if the tty is subsequently closed, the termios settings
are lost. This results in a garbled console if the console is later
suspended and resumed.
Preserve the termios c\_cflag for the serial console when the tty

ext4: fix punch hole on files with indirect mapping
commit 4f579ae7de560e5f449587a6c3f02594d53d4d51 upstream.
Currently punch hole code on files with direct/indirect mapping has some
problems which may lead to a data loss. For example (from Jan Kara):
fallocate -n -p 10240000 4096
will punch the range 10240000 - 12632064 instead of the range 1024000 -
10244096.
Also the code is a bit weird and it's not using infrastructure provided
by indirect.c, but rather creating it's own way.
This patch fixes the issues as well as making the operation to run 4
times faster from my testing (punching out 60GB file). It uses similar
approach used in ext4\_ind\_truncate() which takes advantage of
ext4\_free\_branches() function.
Also rename the ext4\_free\_hole\_blocks() to something more sensible, like
the equivalent we have for extent mapped files. Call it
ext4\_ind\_remove\_space().
This has been tested mostly with fsx and some xfstests which are testing
punch hole but does not require unwritten extents which are not
supported with direct/indirect mapping. Not problems showed up even with
1024k block size.

MAXINT resulted in unexpected register values.
vrm is an u8, so the written value needs to be limited to [0, 255].

Regular randconfig nightly testing has detected problems with omapdrm.
omapdrm fails to build when the kernel is built to support 64-bit DMA

Use %pad to print DMA addresses, rather than %x or %Zx (which is even
more wrong than %x). Avoid passing a uint32\_t pointer into a function

arm64: Fix barriers used for page table modifications
commit 7f0b1bf04511348995d6fce38c87c98a3b5cb781 upstream.
The architecture specification states that both DSB and ISB are required
between page table modifications and subsequent memory accesses using the
corresponding virtual address. When TLB invalidation takes place, the
tlb\_flush\_\* functions already have the necessary barriers. However, there are
other functions like create\_mapping() for which this is not the case.
The patch adds the DSB+ISB instructions in the set\_pte() function for
valid kernel mappings. The invalid pte case is handled by tlb\_flush\_\*
and the user mappings in general have a corresponding update\_mmu\_cache()
call containing a DSB. Even when update\_mmu\_cache() isn't called, the
kernel can still cope with an unlikely spurious page fault by
re-executing the instruction.
In addition, the set\_pmd, set\_pud() functions gain an ISB for
architecture compliance when block mappings are created.

sched: Fix sched\_setparam() policy == -1 logic
commit d8d28c8f00e84a72e8bee39a85835635417bee49 upstream.
The scheduler uses policy == -1 to preserve the current policy state to
implement sched\_setparam(). But, as (int) -1 is equals to 0xffffffff,
it's matching the if (policy & SCHED\_RESET\_ON\_FORK) on
\_sched\_setscheduler(). This match changes the policy value to an
invalid value, breaking the sched\_setparam() syscall.
This patch checks policy == -1 before check the SCHED\_RESET\_ON\_FORK flag.
The following program shows the bug:
int main(void)
{
struct sched\_param param = {
.sched\_priority = 5,
};
sched\_setscheduler(0, SCHED\_FIFO, &param);
param.sched\_priority = 1;
sched\_setparam(0, &param);
param.sched\_priority = 0;
sched\_getparam(0, &param);
if (param.sched\_priority != 1)
printf("failed priority setting (found %d instead of 1)\n",
param.sched\_priority);
else
printf("priority setting fine\n");

xhci: Blacklist using streams on the Etron EJ168 controller
commit 8f873c1ff4ca034626093d03b254e7cb8bb782dd upstream.
Streams on the EJ168 do not work as they should. I've spend 2 days trying
to get them to work, but without success.
The first problem is that when ever you ring the stream-ring doorbell, the
controller starts executing trbs at the beginning of the first ring segment,
event if it ended somewhere else previously. This can be worked around by
allowing enqueing only one td (not a problem with how streams are typically
used) and then resetting our copies of the enqueueing en dequeueing pointers
on a td completion to match what the controller seems to be doing.
This way things seem to start working with uas and instead of being able
to complete only the very first scsi command, the scsi core can probe the disk.
But then things break later on when td-s get enqueued with more then one
trb. The controller does seem to increase its dequeue pointer while executing
a stream-ring (data transfer events I inserted for debugging do trigger).
However execution seems to stop at the final normal trb of a multi trb td,
even if there is a data transfer event inserted after the final trb.
The first problem alone is a serious deviation from the spec, and esp.
dealing with cancellation would have been very tricky if not outright
impossible, but the second problem simply is a deal breaker altogether,
so this patch simply disables streams.
Note this will cause the usb-storage + uas driver pair to automatically switch
to using usb-storage instead of uas on these devices, essentially reverting
to the 3.14 and earlier behavior when uas was marked CONFIG\_BROKEN.

rpm idle call the suspend maybe starved.
Instead we call pm\_runtime\_autosuspend which is checking if the

An example is monitoring device pci config space.
Pci config sysfs handlers calls pci\_config\_pm\_runtime\_put/get

ALSA: hda/realtek - Avoid setting wrong COEF on ALC269 & co
commit f3ee07d8b6e061bf34a7167c3f564e8da4360a99 upstream.
ALC269 & co have many vendor-specific setups with COEF verbs.
However, some verbs seem specific to some codec versions and they
result in the codec stalling. Typically, such a case can be avoided
by checking the return value from reading a COEF. If the return value
is -1, it implies that the COEF is invalid, thus it shouldn't be
written.
This patch adds the invalid COEF checks in appropriate places
accessing ALC269 and its variants. The patch actually fixes the
resume problem on Acer AO725 laptop.

ALSA: hda - restore the gpio led after resume
commit f475371aa65de84fa483a998ab7594531026b9d9 upstream.
On some HP laptops, the mute led is controlled by codec gpio.
When some machine resume from s3/s4, the codec gpio data will be
cleared to 0 by BIOS:
Before suspend:
IO[3]: enable=1, dir=1, wake=0, sticky=0, data=1, unsol=0
After resume:
IO[3]: enable=1, dir=1, wake=0, sticky=0, data=0, unsol=0
To skip the AFG node to enter D3 can't fix this problem.
A workaround is to restore the gpio data when the system resume
back from s3/s4. It is safe even on the machines without this
problem.

commit 7440850c20b69658f322119d20a94dc914127cc7 upstream.
ON the machine, two pin complex (0xb and 0xe) are both routed to
the same external right-side mic jack, this makes the jack can't work.
To fix this problem, set the 0xe to "not connected".

USB: Fix persist resume of some SS USB devices
commit a40178b2fa6ad87670fb1e5fa4024db00c149629 upstream.
Problem Summary: Problem has been observed generally with PM states
where VBUS goes off during suspend. There are some SS USB devices which
take longer time for link training compared to many others. Such
devices fail to reconnect with same old address which was associated
with it before suspend.
When system resumes, at some point of time (dpm\_run\_callback->
usb\_dev\_resume->usb\_resume->usb\_resume\_both->usb\_resume\_device->
usb\_port\_resume) SW reads hub status. If device is present,
then it finishes port resume and re-enumerates device with same
address. If device is not present then, SW thinks that device was
removed during suspend and therefore does logical disconnection
and removes all the resource allocated for this device.
Now, if I put sufficient delay just before root hub status read in
usb\_resume\_device then, SW sees always that device is present. In normal
course(without any delay) SW sees that no device is present and then SW
removes all resource associated with the device at this port. In the
latter case, after sometime, device says that hey I am here, now host
enumerates it, but with new address.
Problem had been reproduced when I connect verbatim USB3.0 hard disc
with my STiH407 XHCI host running with 3.10 kernel.
I see that similar problem has been reported here.
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=53211
Reading above it seems that bug was not in 3.6.6 and was present in 3.8
and again it was not present for some in 3.12.6, while it was present
for few others. I tested with 3.13-FC19 running at i686 desktop, problem
was still there. However, I was failed to reproduce it with 3.16-RC4
running at same i686 machine. I would say it is just a random
observation. Problem for few devices is always there, as I am unable to
find a proper fix for the issue.
So, now question is what should be the amount of delay so that host is
always able to recognize suspended device after resume.
XHCI specs 4.19.4 says that when Link training is successful, port sets
CSC bit to 1. So if SW reads port status before successful link
training, then it will not find device to be present. USB Analyzer log
with such buggy devices show that in some cases device switch on the
RX termination after long delay of host enabling the VBUS. In few other
cases it has been seen that device fails to negotiate link training in
first attempt. It has been reported till now that few devices take as
long as 2000 ms to train the link after host enabling its VBUS and
RX termination. This patch implements a 2000 ms timeout for CSC bit to set
ie for link training. If in a case link trains before timeout, loop will
exit earlier.
This patch implements above delay, but only for SS device and when
persist is enabled.
So, for the good device overhead is almost none. While for the bad
devices penalty could be the time which it take for link training.
But, If a device was connected before suspend, and was removed
while system was asleep, then the penalty would be the timeout ie
2000 ms.
Results:
Verbatim USB SS hard disk connected with STiH407 USB host running 3.10
Kernel resumes in 461 msecs without this patch, but hard disk is
assigned a new device address. Same system resumes in 790 msecs with
this patch, but with old device address.

USB: ehci-pci: USB host controller support for Intel Quark X1000
commit 6e693739e9b603b3ca9ce0d4f4178f0633458465 upstream.
The EHCI packet buffer in/out threshold is programmable for Intel Quark X1000
USB host controller, and the default value is 0x20 dwords. The in/out threshold
can be programmed to 0x80 dwords (512 Bytes) to maximize the perfomrance,
but only when isochronous/interrupt transactions are not initiated by the USB
host controller. This patch is to reconfigure the packet buffer in/out
threshold as maximal as possible to maximize the performance, and 0x7F dwords
(508 Bytes) should be used because the USB host controller initiates
isochronous/interrupt transactions.

USB: devio: fix issue with log flooding
commit d310d05f1225d1f6f2bf505255fdf593bfbb3051 upstream.
usbfs allows user space to pass down an URB which sets URB\_SHORT\_NOT\_OK
for output URBs. That causes usbcore to log messages without limit
for a nonsensical disallowed combination. The fix is to silently drop
the attribute in usbfs.
The problem is reported to exist since 3.14

USB: OHCI: don't lose track of EDs when a controller dies
commit 977dcfdc60311e7aa571cabf6f39c36dde13339e upstream.
This patch fixes a bug in ohci-hcd. When an URB is unlinked, the
corresponding Endpoint Descriptor is added to the ed\_rm\_list and taken
off the hardware schedule. Once the ED is no longer visible to the
hardware, finish\_unlinks() handles the URBs that were unlinked or have
completed. If any URBs remain attached to the ED, the ED is added
back to the hardware schedule -- but only if the controller is
running.
This fails when a controller dies. A non-empty ED does not get added
back to the hardware schedule and does not remain on the ed\_rm\_list;
ohci-hcd loses track of it. The remaining URBs cannot be unlinked,
which causes the USB stack to hang.
The patch changes finish\_unlinks() so that non-empty EDs remain on
the ed\_rm\_list if the controller isn't running. This requires moving
some of the existing code around, to avoid modifying the ED's hardware
fields more than once.

Some jmicron uas chipsets act up (they disconnect from the bus) when sending
more then 32 commands to them at once.
Rather then building an ever growing list with usb-id based quirks for
devices using this chipset, simply reduce the qdepth to 32 when connected
over usb-2. 32 should be plenty to keep things close to maximum
possible throughput on usb-2.

isofs: Fix unbounded recursion when processing relocated directories
commit 410dd3cf4c9b36f27ed4542ee18b1af5e68645a4 upstream.
We did not check relocated directory in any way when processing Rock
Ridge 'CL' tag. Thus a corrupted isofs image can possibly have a CL
entry pointing to another CL entry leading to possibly unbounded
recursion in kernel code and thus stack overflow or deadlocks (if there
is a loop created from CL entries).
Fix the problem by not allowing CL entry to point to a directory entry
with CL entry (such use makes no good sense anyway) and by checking
whether CL entry doesn't point to itself.

HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device\_id early enough
commit ad3e14d7c5268c2e24477c6ef54bbdf88add5d36 upstream.
device\_index is a char type and the size of paired\_dj\_deivces is 7
elements, therefore proper bounds checking has to be applied to
device\_index before it is used.
We are currently performing the bounds checking in
logi\_dj\_recv\_add\_djhid\_device(), which is too late, as malicious device
could send REPORT\_TYPE\_NOTIF\_DEVICE\_UNPAIRED early enough and trigger the
problem in one of the report forwarding functions called from
logi\_dj\_raw\_event().
Fix this by performing the check at the earliest possible ocasion in
logi\_dj\_raw\_event().

The check on report size for REPORT\_TYPE\_LEDS in logi\_dj\_ll\_raw\_request()

HID: logitech: perform bounds checking on device\_id early enough

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/ad3e14d7c5268c2e24477c6ef54bbdf88add5d36)

```
device_index is a char type and the size of paired_dj_deivces is 7
elements, therefore proper bounds checking has to be applied to
device_index before it is used.

We are currently performing the bounds checking in
logi_dj_recv_add_djhid_device(), which is too late, as malicious device
could send REPORT_TYPE_NOTIF_DEVICE_UNPAIRED early enough and trigger the
problem in one of the report forwarding functions called from
logi_dj_raw_event().

Fix this by performing the check at the earliest possible ocasion in
logi_dj_raw_event().

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141210#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2014-09-12 13:01:33 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the Human Interface Device(HID) Bus support(CONFIG_HID) along with a Logitech Unifying receivers full support(CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ) driver, is vulnerable to an OOB read flaw. It could occur if a device offers a malicious HID report with arbitrary device_index.  A local user with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system resulting in DoS.
