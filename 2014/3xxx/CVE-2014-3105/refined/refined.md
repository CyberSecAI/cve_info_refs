- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to login error messages that allow for credential enumeration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The system's login error messages are overly informative, potentially revealing valid user IDs or other information, which can be used for credential enumeration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially enumerate valid user IDs, which could aid them in further attacks, such as brute-force password attempts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the login interface of IBM Rational ClearQuest Web for OSLC integration. An attacker would attempt to log in with various user IDs and observe the resulting error messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the login interface of the affected IBM Rational ClearQuest Web application.
