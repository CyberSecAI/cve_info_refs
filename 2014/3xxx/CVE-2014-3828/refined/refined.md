Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-3828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The primary cause is the **improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands (SQL Injection)**. Specifically, several PHP files within the Centreon application directly incorporate user-supplied input (from GET and POST parameters) into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in various PHP files due to lack of proper input sanitization before being used in SQL queries. Affected files include:
    - `www/include/views/graphs/common/makeXML_ListMetrics.php`
    - `www/include/views/graphs/GetXmlTree.php`
    - `www/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php`
    - `www/include/configuration/configObject/traps/GetXMLTrapsForVendor.php`
    - `www/include/common/javascript/commandGetArgs/cmdGetExample.php`
    - `www/include/views/graphs/graphStatus/displayServiceStatus.php`
    - Many other files across the application which use user controlled input in SQL queries without sanitization (identified from GitHub commit log)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to:
    - **Execute arbitrary SQL queries** against the Centreon database.
    - **Extract sensitive information** from the database (user credentials, configurations, etc.).
    - Potentially **modify or delete data** within the database.
    - This can lead to **full compromise of the Centreon application and its data.**

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is primarily through HTTP GET and POST requests to the vulnerable PHP files, where malicious SQL code is injected via URL parameters or POST data.
- The vulnerabilities are **unauthenticated**, meaning an attacker does not need to have valid credentials to exploit them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Centreon server.
- No special privileges or user accounts on the Centreon system are required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content indicates that Centreon versions **2.5.2 and earlier** are vulnerable to SQL injection (CVE-2014-3828), with indications that prior versions back to 2.0 may also be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was discovered by MaZ, reported to Rapid7 and CERT/CC, and was publicly disclosed on Oct 15, 2014.
- A fix was implemented in Centreon version 2.5.3 by sanitizing user input in SQL queries using `pearDB->escape()`
