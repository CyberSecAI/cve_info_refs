Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3482:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the SQL quoting code within the ActiveRecord component of Ruby on Rails, specifically in the PostgreSQL adapter.
- The issue arises when handling `bitstring` data types, which are unique to PostgreSQL and not present in other databases.
- The code does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided values used in SQL queries involving `bitstring` data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting specially crafted values, an attacker can introduce arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to:
   - Data breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
   - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting critical data.
   - Privilege escalation: Gaining elevated access to the database.
   - Denial of service: Disrupting the availability of the database.
   - Complete system compromise, in severe cases, depending on the database configuration and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User-supplied Input:** The attack vector involves user-controlled input being passed directly to the vulnerable SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Specifically Crafted Values:** Attackers craft specific input values designed to exploit the vulnerability, and those values can be embedded within HTTP request parameters, JSON payloads, or any input method available on the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests or otherwise provide input to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of PostgreSQL Data Types:** The attacker needs some level of awareness that the application uses PostgreSQL with `bitstring` type attributes.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to construct input values to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Versions of Ruby on Rails from 2.0.0 to 3.2.18 were vulnerable. Versions 4.0 and later are not affected by this vulnerability.
- **Specific Code Examples:** Vulnerable code takes the form of:
   ```ruby
   Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value])
   ```
- **Workaround:** The suggested workaround is to avoid using user-controlled values directly in queries with the `bitstring` data type, however upgrading is strongly advised due to the complexity of ensuring secure input handling.
- **Fix:** Patches were released for Rails versions 3.2.19, 4.0.7, and 4.1.3.
- Red Hat also released a fix for their products, specifically `ruby193-rubygem-activerecord` package.
- Debian also released a security update to fix the issue in `ruby-activerecord-3.2` packages.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sean Griffin of thoughtbot.

**In summary,** CVE-2014-3482 describes an SQL injection vulnerability in Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord component that arises from improper handling of the `bitstring` data type in PostgreSQL, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL via user-supplied data.
