A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker cause the device to reload. This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended denial of service (DoS) condition.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available.
This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-rsvp["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-rsvp"]
Note: The September 24, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html"]

Devices enabled to use the RSVP protocol in Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.
There are two methods to determine whether a device is enabled for RSVP:
Determine whether RSVP is active on a device.
Determine whether RSVP commands are included in the device configuration.
The preferred method to verify whether RSVP is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to determine whether RSVP is active on the device.
Determine Whether RSVP is Active on a Device
Administrators can determine whether RSVP is enabled on a Cisco IOS device by using the show ip rsvp interface show command. Affected devices will include at least one interface in the output of the command. The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is active:
Router>
show ip rsvp interface
interface rsvp allocated i/f max flow max sub max VRF
Gi0/1 ena 0 100K 100K 0
Router>
The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is not active on any of the router interfaces, making the device not vulnerable.
Router> show ip rsvp interface
interface rsvp allocated i/f max flow max sub max VRF
Router>
Determine Whether RSVP Commands are Included in the Device Configuration
Devices configured to use RSVP protocol are affected by this vulnerability.
To determine whether RSVP has been configured in the Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software device,
the administrator can use the
show running | include rsvp bandwidth|mpls traffic-eng tunnel
command. Affected devices will include the
ip rsvp bandwidth
interface configuration command or the
mpls trafic-eng tunnel
interface configuration command at least once.
The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is active:
Router# show running | include rsvp|mpls traffic-eng tunnel
ip rsvp bandwidth 100
ip rsvp bandwidth 100
mpls traffic-eng tunnel
Router#
Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release
To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].

The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:
Cisco NX-OS Software
Cisco IOS XR Software
Cisco ASA Software
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability when configured with the RSVP protocol. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device reload. This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.
A device is vulnerable if it is configured with the RSVP protocol. An attacker with knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPv4 or IPv6 RSVP packets via UDP port 1698 or IP protocol 46 to vulnerable devices. Either traffic destined to the device or transit traffic can exploit the vulnerability. No other RSVP UDP ports, TCP ports, or IP protocols are affected. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to reload the device.
Either traffic destined to the device or transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited only when the malformed packets ingress the router on an interface that has been enabled for RSVP.
A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is available.
This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui11547["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui11547"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3354.
The following mitigation exists for this vulnerability:
Control Plane Policing
For mitigation on IPv4, Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted
UDP traffic on port 1698 and IP protocol 46.
Cisco IOS software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The CoPP example below should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range.
!--- Feature: RSVP
access-list 150 deny udp TRUSTED\_SOURCE\_ADDRESSES WILDCARD any eq 1698
access-list 150 deny 46 TRUSTED\_SOURCE\_ADDRESSES WILDCARD any
!--- Deny RSVP over UDP traffic from all other sources destined
!--- to the device control plane.
access-list 150 permit udp any any eq 1698
access-list 150 permit 46 any any
!--- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and
!--- Layer4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies
!--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
!--- to infrastructure devices
!--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
!--- the CoPP feature
class-map match-all drop-udp-class
match access-group 150
!--- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
!--- Control-Plane of the device.
policy-map drop-udp-traffic
class drop-udp-class
drop
!--- Apply the Policy-Map to the
!--- Control-Plane of the device
control-plane
service-policy input drop-udp-traffic
In the preceding CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs) that match the potential exploit packets with the permit action result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map drop function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop function. Please note that the policy-map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains:
policy-map drop-udp-traffic
class drop-udp-class police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action
drop
CoPP is not an effective mitigation against an attack via IPv6.
Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found in the documents,
Control Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices and
Control Plane Policing

The following mitigation exists for this vulnerability:
Control Plane Policing
For mitigation on IPv4, Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted
UDP traffic on port 1698 and IP protocol 46.
Cisco IOS software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The CoPP example below should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range.
!--- Feature: RSVP
access-list 150 deny udp TRUSTED\_SOURCE\_ADDRESSES WILDCARD any eq 1698
access-list 150 deny 46 TRUSTED\_SOURCE\_ADDRESSES WILDCARD any
!--- Deny RSVP over UDP traffic from all other sources destined
!--- to the device control plane.
access-list 150 permit udp any any eq 1698
access-list 150 permit 46 any any
!--- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and
!--- Layer4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies
!--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
!--- to infrastructure devices
!--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
!--- the CoPP feature
class-map match-all drop-udp-class
match access-group 150
!--- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
!--- Control-Plane of the device.
policy-map drop-udp-traffic
class drop-udp-class
drop
!--- Apply the Policy-Map to the
!--- Control-Plane of the device
control-plane
service-policy input drop-udp-traffic
In the preceding CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs) that match the potential exploit packets with the permit action result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map drop function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop function. Please note that the policy-map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains:
policy-map drop-udp-traffic
class drop-udp-class police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action
drop
CoPP is not an effective mitigation against an attack via IPv6.
Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found in the documents,

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent Network AV:Â Network  Access Complexity AC:Â High AC:Â Medium AC:Â Low  Authentication Au:Â Multiple Au:Â Single Au:Â None  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Partial C:Â Complete  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Partial I:Â Complete  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Partial A:Â Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC:Â Unconfirmed  RC:Â Uncorroborated  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP:Â None  CDP:Â Low  CDP:Â Low-Medium  CDP:Â Medium-High  CDP:Â High  CDP:Â Not Defined   Target Distribution TD:Â None  TD:Â Low  TD:Â Medium  TD:Â High  TD:Â Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsDevices enabled to use the RSVP protocol in Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.      There are two methods to determine whether a device is enabled for RSVP:   + Determine whether RSVP is active on a device.   + Determine whether RSVP commands are included in the device configuration.The preferred method to verify whether RSVP is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to determine whether RSVP is active on the device.   Determine Whether RSVP is Active on a DeviceAdministrators can determine whether RSVP is enabled on a Cisco IOS device by using the **show ip rsvp interface** show command. Affected devices will include at least one interface in the output of the command. The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is active: ```   Router>    show ip rsvp interface   interface    rsvp  allocated  i/f max  flow max sub max  VRF    Gi0/1        ena   0          100K     100K     0    Router>      ``` The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is not active on any of the router interfaces, making the device not vulnerable. ```   Router> show ip rsvp interface   interface    rsvp  allocated  i/f max  flow max sub max  VRF    Router>      ``` Determine Whether RSVP Commands are Included in the Device ConfigurationDevices configured to use RSVP protocol are affected by this vulnerability.   To determine whether RSVP has been configured in the Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software device,   the administrator can use the   **show running | include rsvp bandwidth|mpls traffic-eng tunnel**   command. Affected devices will include the   **ip rsvp bandwidth**   interface configuration command or the   **mpls trafic-eng tunnel**   interface configuration command at least once.      The following example shows a device on which the RSVP protocol is active: ```   Router# show running | include rsvp|mpls traffic-eng tunnel    ip rsvp bandwidth 100    ip rsvp bandwidth 100    mpls traffic-eng tunnel   Router#      ``` Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco ASA SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability when configured with the RSVP protocol. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a device reload. This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.      A device is vulnerable if it is configured with the RSVP protocol. An attacker with knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPv4 or IPv6 RSVP packets via UDP port 1698 or IP protocol 46 to vulnerable devices. Either traffic destined to the device or transit traffic can exploit the vulnerability. No other RSVP UDP ports, TCP ports, or IP protocols are affected. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to reload the device.         Either traffic destined to the device or transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited only when the malformed packets ingress the router on an interface that has been enabled for RSVP.      A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is available.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui11547](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui11547) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3354.  Workarounds  * The following mitigation exists for this vulnerability:   Control Plane PolicingFor mitigation on IPv4, Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted   UDP traffic on port 1698 and IP protocol 46.
